FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

kinekocat,Brilliant_Rub_5206,"I think too many new people watch the show trying to figure it out because people like us who have seen it hype it up as this mystery full of plot twists.

When I watched the show, I went in not expecting anything crazy so things like Reiner's resemblance to the Armoured went completely over my head."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,marcher138,"I think you're right. I didn't even know humans could turn into titans until Eren came out of his. Then by the time the Female Titan arc started, I didn't even remember what the Armored looked like. I figured the Armored and Colossal were probably just some currently-unnamed outsiders.

If I went in thinking ""oh man the bad guys are right here the whole time,"" I'd probably have guesses on who could be who pretty early."
marcher138,McBurger,"Even long after Eren shifted, I still for some reason never concluded that the other titans might also be shifting humans.  I was thinking that maybe 1 in 1000 titans are born randomly into these special forms or something?  And also that Eren was a special chosen one and the only human titan hybrid that could transform between the two. 

I never knew Annie was the Female Titan until they came out and said it directly lol it blew my mjnd"
marcher138,ldunord,"I did have any spoilers or anything, so everything came out as surprises to me…"
marcher138,Brilliant_Rub_5206,"That last part.

Because so many of the reveals are literally in your face. Even Eren's titan looks just like him and the green eyes are a dead giveaway."
marcher138,paraxzz,"Exactly me, but for some reason my gf guessed Annie to be that titan, i didnt realize that until they were standing above the staircase."
marcher138,jibishot,"Ija, the second part of your comment.

Yea that was the whole problem I had with the show from the first arc. ""It's coming from inside the house"" vibe immediately, and then was throughly disappointed until the last arcs."
marcher138,Gostandy,"i went into the series knowing about titan shifters and knowing reiner was a shifter, but yet, i was STILL fooled because i let my dumb guard down during season 1 when reiner was a chill dude and thought “there’s no way, i must have misinterpreted things”"
marcher138,ZymZymZym777,"It was weird that the colossal Titan disappeared. Where did he go, not like something of his size could really hide"
Brilliant_Rub_5206,SnooGoats6180,"I agree. When they first showed Eren’s titan form, I guessed it was him because obviously they didn’t kill off the mc that early. But I was still SHOCKED by Reiner and Bertholdt lol. I thought Eren was just special or something haha."
SnooGoats6180,noob_kaibot,"All of the Paradis Titan reveals were done well imo. I know many caught on early, but *I* was surprised. 

The armored/colossal was my personal fave- the calm leading up to it with the rest of the squad inconspicuously listening in on the conversation. The build up of the music, & the electricity surrounding Reiner & Birth holes reveal was ""hype"" imo. Even Reiners monologue was a nice touch.

I liked Annie's as well; I liked her laugh & blushing expression- it came so out of left field & was uncharacteristic of her. I know she's hated on, & that's fine, I don't have an opinion regarding that. She's one of my favorite characters, 3rd to Mikasa & Levi."
SnooGoats6180,Dirty_LemonsV2,So did Eren for a while 😁
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Ok_Discussion9693,"Same, when I saw the titans in the walls I was like “well they’ve been in there for 100 years, they’ll be fine, maybe, probably“"
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Slurpyz,"Same here. I started watching just because it was a popular anime. I didn’t know anything beforehand and didn’t actually expect the story to be deep so I didn’t overanalyze anything and just took in the story as it was. Reiner and Bertholdt’s revelation was incredible and out of nowhere for me. Additionally, rewatching was absolutely incredible to notice all the foreshadowing and details I missed."
Slurpyz,betweenthelines010,"Yeah I'm not the type to overanalyze and expect twists most of the time anyway and I definitely didn't with this, it's a long time since I watched now and this post just popped up on my feed lol but now I really want to go back and rewatch from the start to see everything I didn't notice"
Brilliant_Rub_5206,PessimistYanker792,"How do folks get so much self spoilers and hints and feelings? I started in 2015 and have waited each full season to end to watch the entire thing from start again. I sort of like not finding hints, clues and love to just soak it in. The plot twists are the best thing in AoT."
PessimistYanker792,Ill-Butterscotch-622,Probably get snippets of it while scrolling tiktok
PessimistYanker792,jibishot,"There are no plot twists in AoT.

There was so much foreshadowing they foreshadowed their own show until the last arc. Brutal really."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,leo412,"I legit go in totally blind just 2 years ago, have zero idea human transform into titans , so never make the connection, I legit thought Eren died and he is a fake protagonist, no idea about Reiner truth"
Brilliant_Rub_5206,SexxxyWesky,Agreed. Watched the first season as it aired. Then watched the rest without spoilers last year. I was NOT expecting half the twists in this show lol
SexxxyWesky,noob_kaibot,"As a fully grown man, I teared up so much from this anime. Straight up got weepy during some scenes too, lol.. & they weren't just ""sad tears,"" mind you- I get emotionally triggered pretty easily during ""inspiring"" scenes, especially when the music hits along with it; the right kind of audio can do absolute wonders in that regard.

... One non-AOT example would be when Gandalf led the dawn charge down the steep slope during the battle of Helms Deep when it seemed that all was lost. So damn good. Another recent one was when I watched the cinematic reveal trailer for *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*- It hit harder after completing the game & knowing the story.

I *never* cry from my personal life experiences, so I'm glad for film & music for that; I think it's *such* a *release*, & unlike anything else. Healthy too, I'm sure.  I wish I could do it more often, haha."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,ExaltedPenguin,"Mooooood i went in pretty blind and got taken for a ride lmao

Annie I saw immediately tho, surprised not everyone did there because it was established by then that people could shift and the face shape is so unique"
Brilliant_Rub_5206,MonsutaReipu,"This is spot on.  It also annoys me, because I personally hate spoilers, and the journey of discovery in such a huge part of my enjoyment that makes some shows and movies really special.  When I watch something like this with someone new, I really want them to share in that experience, so when they're off to the races guessing major plot points and twists right away, it just bums me out.

I remember watching Oldboy with my girlfriend, a movie I have really loved for a long time, and she was like ""Is that her dad?"" and i'm like fucking christ, that's the biggest twist of the movie, ruined.  I didn't even want to finish it after that.  Lesson learned to not hype up movies having twists or anything 'crazy' in them, otherwise it's just going to bait people into ruining it for themselves by trying to figure it out before it happens."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Clean_Molasses,It didn't even click with me that there was others like Eren and that they would WANT the wall to fall. I thought they were just mutants or something and still didn't even suspect them after Annie was discovered.
Brilliant_Rub_5206,petewil1291,I see so many comments from people saying they figured out who the titans were. Y'all are smart because my dumb ass had no clue.
Brilliant_Rub_5206,6nine4twenty,definitely. i went into this show only knowing its a great anime and none of the story. worked out well in the end.
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Moakmeister,"It didn’t help that I never noticed the Armored Titan had hair. 

Or the fact that I was just not good at predicting these twists. I didn’t even see Annie as being the Female Titan. Something totally obvious to 99% of other viewers COMPLETELY blindsided me."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Strange_Tough_4474,I was reading the manga and then suddenly in one panel Reiner was on the wall and telling Erin that “yo i am the armoured titan and this buddy of mine is collosal. You are coming with us erin.” I was like yeah that was a nice joke. But guess what? It wasnt a joke. I was like ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!???? ☠️ hit me like a brick in the chest. Did not see it coming ever.
Brilliant_Rub_5206,No_Variation_2199,"That's how I feel too. I didn't try too hard guessing who are the Titans because I expected them to be totally different beings. Basically, you had to be not expecting that it is a show about plot twists to let the plot twists really get to you, and the fact they make more sense after them is the best part of AoT imo."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,MentalMunky,"Yeah we really shouldn’t be telling people it’s full of mystery and plot twists.

I just tell people it’s a late stage apocalypse show where the “zombies” have wiped out all of humanity other than this city."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Nic_St,"I'm not so sure. I watched season one when it first aired and as soon as we saw Eren's transformation, most people I talked to about the show were pretty sure that Reiner was The Armoured. Same for Annie. If you're not questioning stuff and just watching what happens, I get maybe not noticing it, but Isayama did leave a lot of ""clues"" for us to figure it out."
Nic_St,Brilliant_Rub_5206,"The Armoured appeared once and then he was never seen again until the reveal, not including flashbacks. I was just watching episode by episode and kind of ""forgot"" about him.

I knew Annie and Eren were their respective Titans almost instantly because of the resemblance."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Klusterphuck67,"Legit i was tricked by their sob story as well as that flashback of kid warrior group getting one of em chomped by Ymir. Like yeah they look similar, but at that time i just considered it a conincident.

That and Reiner getting grabbed by Annie. I only maked it much later when they said they're from the same hometown.


Yeah im kinda slow :v"
Klusterphuck67,Brilliant_Rub_5206,"No same.

I see reactors on YouTube seeing Reiner get squashed by Annie and escape, and they immediately get suspicious.

Me personally, I was like ""oh yay!! 😄"""
Brilliant_Rub_5206,Shiroppi,"On top of that, I think it definitely was more impactful for those that didn't read the manga and watched back then when we had to wait days for each weekly episode. And then to have to wait 4 years for season 2, there was no way to remember those similarities between soldiers and titans.

Now when people can just binge and have everyone's face and voice fresh in their memory, it's way easier to notice those details."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,j-snipes10,"I mean, it’s a fantastic show but it telegraphs the plot twists in the beginning. Second appearance of the colossal and the armored is when i kind of got the feeling it was Reiner and bertholdt. I knew the female was Annie immediately. It doesn’t really hide the twists."
j-snipes10,Brilliant_Rub_5206,"The Armoured only appeared once before the reveal.

To see the Colossal's second appearance and figure out that it's Broomstick is crazy though."
Brilliant_Rub_5206,YurxDoug,"I watched this show when there was only season 1, I knew nothing about it. First thing I thought when I saw Reinner was ""he looks like that titan from the beginning"".

Funnily enough, I didnt notice it was Annie until seconds before they actually revealed it lol"
Brilliant_Rub_5206,DaFetacheeseugh,"I was there when it was written (i.e. only first season a few months after it came out)

It seemed really obvious especially with the big nose lady being the female titan. It was more of the *why and how* they are doing this.

After x amount of years, life came along and I couldn't care less. Still neat to hear people glomp over the show, even if I don't know wtf most of y'all are talking about"
kinekocat,MediumPox95,Showed aot to a friend and she said 3 eps in that she's getting darth vader vibes from Eren (good to evil). I almost shut down
MediumPox95,Hairy_Skill_9768,"He's ""I'll kill them all"" was a slight hint 

Yeah very subtle"
Hairy_Skill_9768,anty_van,"Plus his little stunt in the cabin, yeah a normal kid doesn't just kill two people"
MediumPox95,TargetWeird,"Kind obvious, in my opinion"
TargetWeird,sliiime,Ehhhhh
TargetWeird,chucktheninja,What do you mean? There is no corelation between a deep seated rage fueling a desire to exterminate something and becoming a bad guy.
MediumPox95,None,Eren was always going to blow the fuck up after Episode 1. The question was how.
MediumPox95,684beach,"I mean it seemed the obvious thing for the story to make him a “hero” and then become a more realistic version of that. I just never thought they had the balls to go the direction I wanted, because it seems anime loves the “person because evil through circumstance then the plot contrives a situation to make them good” trope. I actually dont know many animes where misery is directly caused by the protagonist."
MediumPox95,Defiant-Ad2876,"Yeah bro eren, anakin and Paul atreides have similar good-to-bad-to-good again type arcs"
Defiant-Ad2876,TilakPPRE,I don't think Eren's really counts as turning good again
Defiant-Ad2876,rolltied,Paul doesn't exist past book two. Plz let me have this...
MediumPox95,UntrimmedBagel,That's kind of his whole thing though
MediumPox95,SpicyBoi1998,"Dude straight up says he wants to kill all men, women, and children outside of Paradis"
SpicyBoi1998,MediumPox95,Not in the s1
kinekocat,Code-V,Next he's gonna say Annie looks like the female titan.
Code-V,Zenna73,The fool lol
Code-V,Understandthisokay,Imagine my shock when my husband theorized 2 episodes in that the titans are the regular people.
Understandthisokay,NAWINUS,He did? 😭
Understandthisokay,KennyKillsKenjaku,That was one of my first guesses when season 1 was airing. Since they all looked like fucked up humans.
Code-V,Oswaldthestegosaurus,doesn’t she?
kinekocat,ToastPlusNine,"I remember being early in the series, before the manga had even revealed them- saying to my friend “Reiner looks just like the armored titan and always hangs around the guy who’s really tall, I bet he’s the colossal “ and my friend thinking I was an idiot for suggesting that. I honestly don’t know how more people don’t have that thought"
ToastPlusNine,SweetPea4Life,"Yeah, Female Titan looked just like Annie. And after that, I thought the Armored Titan was either Reiner or Mikai because of their haircuts."
SweetPea4Life,Makerpace,"Then Miche bit the dust first ep of season two so im sure that narrowed it down real quick, lmao"
SweetPea4Life,Schnick_industries,They didn’t try to hide the bone structure at all
SweetPea4Life,FreshPrinceOfIndia,"Tbh i never thought female titan looked like annie, mostly because of the hair 😭 after the reveal it made sense tho yeah and the eyes especially give it away"
SweetPea4Life,ButterCupHeartXO,"I was so dumb that I thought, ""wow the female titan looks just like Annie. That's strange."" But when they revealed that Annie was the female titan and my reaction was, ""whaaaat??? This is fucking crazy"" and it was even worse for armor and colossal reveals because I just didn't make the connection"
SweetPea4Life,PBR_King,I thought it was a red herring tbh
SweetPea4Life,FieldBubbly,Not only did they look alike but didn’t they have the exact same fighting stance?
SweetPea4Life,Simphiwe_xyz,"For Annie, I just thought: The show's setting looks to be inspired by European countries, in this case—Germany.

The titan is female. What does an average German woman look like ? Blonde with blue eyes. Yep, seems logical enough. No need to spend an extra second thinking about that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)."
ToastPlusNine,Eclipsiical,"I imagine it is because the Armored Titan only appears once before the reveal and if you’re binging the show by yourself, you are probably more likely to be caught up in the plot than to sit down and analyze the faces of each character to the Titan.  It’s different when you are watching as it airs weekly (or reading a manga in which you can take as long as you want to stare at it), where you have plenty of downtime to go online, talk to people, and share theories."
Eclipsiical,Plasmatiic,Yeah back when only S1 was out the debates started for anime-onlys about who the Armored and Colossal were. Most people who engaged in the community at that time either knew from a manga spoiler or could reasonably conclude who they were by the time of the reveal. It still hit different though and I think I was still clueless about Beanhole
Eclipsiical,Strange_Tough_4474,"Trust me bro as i have mentioned just now in this thread i as a manga reader literally thought reiner was joking when that panel came up. He really went like,” yo erin, i am the armoured titan and this buddy of mine is the collosal titan. And you my friend are coming with us.” I was like yeah you must be joking and then bam they ARE TURNING INTO TITANS. I have never been this oblivious to a plot twist in my entire life."
ToastPlusNine,Far_Quit_4073,"Same here. There are so many giveaways that point to Reiner and Annie being Titans. Their Titans hair and facial structures. They are also are conveniently gone when a hairy moment arises. 

Not to mention that they share dialogue that can be read in between the lines. That ass kicking by Annie that she gave Reiner was overkill even if you are pissed.

I think Mikasa actually realized that there was more to this situation than meets the eye which is why she threw hands with Annie. Apart from hurting Eren lol. Those moves were strange and definitely from somewhere else which can tell you where someone is from. You can find alot about someone by fighting them if they have a grudge or anger (talking with your fists). 

Reiner finding out that Ymir was from another country was another clue. 

The only one I think that would be tough to find out would be Bertholt because theres not much about him. If you know Reiner is the Armoured Titan the logical conclusion is to have Bertholt as an accomplice because there were two Titans that attacked Shiganshina that day. His face looks similar to the colossal titan but that can be overlooked pretty easily. 

I was very surprised that so many people didn’t realize who they were when they were revealed. I expected more comments of “I knew it!” But it was the complete opposite. This community holds this scene in high regard for that plot twist but what makes it legendary for me is solely Eren’s reaction. Its tragic."
Far_Quit_4073,Azure_Dauragon,"I gotta say some of those points seem picked with hindsight in mind, which is why people like the reveals so much because the info is there which on multiple views you get to enjoy.
But without that knowledge they still work just fine.

Annie beating them could be her being isolated and putting reiner in his place (which was what happened but with more pent up anger)
She also did the same thing to eren.

Reiner being similar to armored was talked about, but anime having a more silver coloured hair in first eps helped.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but reiner did not find ymir was from different country.
He just asked her how she could read that - we know it's because he can too, but in the context of the scene it is framed as a slip up from her as no one else should be able to read it.
Specially given the context and tension of suspected traitor and being holed up.

I do think a lot of people made those connections, but even with their disappearing acts, there was plausible deniability.
Reiner ""getting away from female titan in badass moment as top of the class cadet"" - and his delusions where he gets lost thinking he is a citizen of the walls.

The twist worked so well because it was so balls to the wall.

""I'm the armored titan, he's colossus, join us and let's go, no time to waste""
Followed by mikasa kill mode is a fenomenal moment that is later explored by reiner actually thinking he would get eren to join them."
ToastPlusNine,ConnorTheCleric,I was sure from the moment I laid my eyes on Reiner that he was the Armored Titan but for some reason I never suspected Bertholdt. He just looks so innocent.
ConnorTheCleric,pontiacbandit0,lol I thought Commander Pixis was the colosal bc he was bald and always drinking from the flask (I thought the flask was fluid that either let a Titan be human or a human become a Titan)
ConnorTheCleric,zenoe1562,"I've been rewatching the anime and I never made this connection until your comment:

  
Of the Warrior Candidates, Berthold was the most reserved of the bunch. It's only fitting that the most reserved Scout inherited the Colossal Titan. 

It wasn't until seeing the Colossal's ability to become a living nuke that I realized why Berthold always looked so sullen.  Armin has the same look throughout season 4. While they both understood the burden of the power they wielded, it weighed heavier on Armin due to his empathetic nature and desire for peace."
ToastPlusNine,SexxxyWesky,I went in to the series completely blind. I never once considered them to be the armored and colossal titans. When they dropped the news to Eren so casually in the episode I had to rewind to make sure I heard it correctly.
ToastPlusNine,ThrownAwayYesterday-,"I had a random brain connection when I was first watching AoT, and put together who the female titan was through her fighting style (Annie's iconic stance in particular) and how she looked. I felt like a Scout when my random hypothesis was proven correct"
kinekocat,XTurtleman394X,"Watching through with some of my friends and it’s so funny hearing them theorize about the show. Some things they caught on to really quick, others are way off. My personal favorite of theirs, is the episode after the beast titans first appearance, my friend formed the idea that the beast titan is a “nomad” who has lived outside the walls for years, hence the hair and ability to speak, who is like a parent who controls the smaller titans. Way off, but also unique from anything I’ve heard before"
XTurtleman394X,AmbitiousAd2269,When I was first watching I thought there was a society of intelligent titans outside the walls
AmbitiousAd2269,XTurtleman394X,"I really wish I remembered my initial predictions lol. I first watched it at 15 and it was my second anime, so I don’t think I even tried to predict much, and just watched the story play out, but there’s certainly things I never could’ve expected lol"
AmbitiousAd2269,ThrownAwayYesterday-,"I thought there was a society of humans who worshipped titans and wanted to tear down society within the walls because of some ancient grudge with the king lol 

The whole ""warriors"" thing had me convinced of that. . . Like that's exactly what a tribal society of revolutionary shapeshifting barbarians would call their soldiers, and Zeke being called ""war-chief"" felt so on the nose 💀

Boy was I wrong"
AmbitiousAd2269,TilakPPRE,"Same, and I thought Annie was sent inside alone as a spy. Reiner and Bertholdt blew my mind."
AmbitiousAd2269,taehalsey,This was my thought too. That there was a tribe of intelligent titans that were attacking and trying to take over the human race and that’s what cause the extinction of humanity in the first place
XTurtleman394X,Relevant-Key-3290,What other predictions they did and what did they guess corectly?
Relevant-Key-3290,XTurtleman394X,"They guessed Annie was the female titan a couple episodes before it was revealed, but that pretty heavily suggested imo

They also guessed Reiner not long Annie’s reveal bc they were comparing the characters to the armored titan, but I gaslit them before they were certain of anything lol

Prior to the Kenny Arc with the reveal of Grisha killing Historia’s family and stealing the founding titan, they thought Grisha was the person making titans since they figured it was him that turned eren into a titan. Which is close to the idea that people are getting turned into titans by other people, but they haven’t actually came to that conclusion yet so 🤷‍♂️"
kinekocat,Shapeshiftee,I’ll get the shovel
kinekocat,tpn23194,"Ngl I had seen some stuff or two of Aot before i read the manga and watched the anime. According to my brother who introduced it to me. The first thing I said when I saw the Armoured Titan was ""That looks like Reiner but who is Reiner."" He literally whacked me on the head with a cushion and made me finish the manga before watching the anime,"
kinekocat,BreadditUser,"Ha! I remember rewatching season one before two had come out, and noticed how they showed Reiner's back to Eren as he listened in on him telling the other cadets what the plotArmoured Titan looked like. Said to myself ""I've seen enough anime to know what's up"""
kinekocat,Puzzleheaded_Step468,"The moment i saw the attack titan i knew it's eren

The moment i saw the female titan i knew it's annie

Reiner... i completely missed"

Puzzleheaded_Step468,blueplanetgalaxy,same
kinekocat,Few-Mail3887,I honestly felt really dumb my first watch. I had no idea. I didn’t even know the basis of the show and I started in 2019. I only managed to figure out Eren was a titan the episode before it was revealed cause the hairstyle looked vaguely familiar.
Few-Mail3887,kinekocat,"Same for feeling dumb the first watch, but tbf I watched without spoilers so the thought that anyone was a titan shifter didn’t cross my mind to start with"
kinekocat,ConfidenceSad8340,"If it makes you feel any better, I gasped, guffawed, and gulped at the reveal

JVanman18,Imaginary-West-5653,Those are my favorite reactions!
kinekocat,ttvNiels,"On my first watch I didn't expect reiner or berthold but when I saw the female titan the first time I was like: ""Why does she kinda have the same face as Annie? Did they reuse her design or smth?"""
ttvNiels,SexxxyWesky,No literally 😭 I clocked Annie immediately but was taken by surprise for the other 2
kinekocat,hisokard,"I'm showing the anime to my gf and as soon as she saw the female titan she was like, “oh she's clearly that one girl who didn't join the scouts”. I hope she forgives me later for gaslighting her so hard."
kinekocat,ZealousidealPipe8389,"Nah bro totally knew, Reiner being the armored titan is the fandoms least guarded secret."
kinekocat,shoahunter,"I think the design was supposed to give it away in some respect, similar to the female titan it brought uncertainty and tension. The surprise was in the sudden reveal, less so the identity."
shoahunter,SexxxyWesky,For real. I couldn’t believe how casual the reveal was. We had to rewind to make sure we heard it right!!!
kinekocat,Diyan29,Honestly I’m kinda glad I was clueless about them being the armoured and colossal titan until they were stuck in the tower that’s when I started suspecting them lol
kinekocat,rilesg0510,"When in doubt remember the three G's for preventing friends from getting spoiled. Gaslight, gaslight, and gaslight"
kinekocat,BugzBallsack,Meanwhile my wife season 2: Reiner is such a nice guy 🤓
kinekocat,1000th_evilman,"my dad (halfway through the first episode) “so are the walls made of titans or something?” 

wow dad. what the fuck ???😭😭😭

me: “well they have been there for a long time so no one really knows. it will get explained i promise”"
1000th_evilman,SexxxyWesky,Damn that’s crazy lol
1000th_evilman,SeeThruSmoke,He definitely getting spoilers
kinekocat,Slight_Mammoth2109,"In my first watch through I didn’t even realize the armored titan was armored, I just thought it was a bigger one charging to get their next meal, then all the sudden they started talking about this other titan and I was confused, 2nd watch through was more obvious"
kinekocat,Lilli11918,"Lol yeah I thought the same thing when I first watched. I clocked Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie as the titans but I thought that they didn’t know they shifted into them and didn’t know what they were doing, not that they had some sort of motive behind everything"
kinekocat,Francophilippe,"First time I watched AoT was with English dub and I thought he was called Rhino; I remember thinking “that’s a weird name”. And then I saw the armoured titan and thought “heh, that looks like Rhino”, convinced it was a deliberate naming strategy. I realised I’d got his name wrong an episode or two later but by then I couldn’t unsee him as a titan."
kinekocat,bradd_91,The manga was much more subtle thankfully.
kinekocat,Amnesiaftw,"So I’m curious if everyone that noticed also knew ahead of time that some people are titans. 

I guess we already knew from Eren being a titan but I thought he was special the first time and didn’t really consider there were traitors amongst the scouts."
kinekocat,Lost_Needleworker676,Literally guessed most of the titans before they were revealed; except for the colossal. They really needed to hide it better in the character designs
kinekocat,picklestring,can somebody remind me why this character was making this face?
picklestring,SonZir0,"Basically stark contrast between Armin's earlier ""what a wonderful goal, it moves my heart and soul"" line (I don't remember the exact wording) and what he said a few seconds earlier in the scene on the thumbnail ""We have NO CHOICE but to help them"" (once again, I don't remember the exact phrase).

Elena was pretty happy that at least someone could understand and appreciate their plan, but turns out it was just an act. Armin showed his true colors, Elena couldn't help but show.. THAT face"
SonZir0,picklestring,thank you! I remember thinkin the scary level came out of no where
kinekocat,Rough_Director3615,No cause I knew Annie and Reiner were Titan shifters. Bell toller was the only one I wasn’t able to figure out
Rough_Director3615,RelativeMundane9045,Is it wrong to try to pick up Titans in Paradis?
kinekocat,UntrimmedBagel,"I watched the show pretty late. I didn't really have too many spoilers other than reading ""Reiner's titan"" somewhere. But just because of the way things were set up, and knowing Eren was a good titan, I figured maybe Reiner would acquire one later on? By early S2 I realized. Jaw still hit the floor on S2E6."
kinekocat,King_mf_Brandor,"I convinced my buddy to watch AOT with me but I stressed that he should pay close attention to all the details, which was a mistake because this fucker picked up on Reiner QUICK"
kinekocat,PriorAcanthisitta587,"Every time Reiner, Bert and Annie are in the same shot together I’m looking to see if they clock it"
kinekocat,EleanorAgain,A friend of mine predicted the wall titans by episode 3 and I legit thought she might have looked at spoilers lol
kinekocat,Dense-Bend-7879,"A lot of times these comments first time viewers say are just passing thoughts. Us dwelling on them is what really makes someone suspicious. If someone throws out a theory of any kind you just gotta nod and tell them their thoughts interesting and it's a good theory. Trying to convince them they're wrong is always a bad idea. You giving any genuine reaction is giving them information the show isn't. That's what really ruins the surprise. If they figure it out purely based off the shows hints that's far more fulfilling. 


Don't give them any information basically."
kinekocat,gecata96,"Just act surprised and say you thought so too when you started watching. 

“It’s an unpopular opinion, what’s the chance?!”"
kinekocat,fuckbombcore,Wasn't it supposed to be obvious to the viewer? I thought it was dramatic irony.
kinekocat,HoilowdareOfficial,This was me but with Annie
kinekocat,MeganplaysisSTINKY,"“Huh, yeah that’s weird!!”"
MeganplaysisSTINKY,kinekocat,I just gaslighted the crap outta him instead 👍
kinekocat,Elegant-Buyer8998,"I honnestly could never guess the plot when watching the anime, I tried to figure out things and get some clues but was always missing the whole picture and deeper meaning of things...

Even when the show had said that a titan eating a shifter would gain the shifter power, I still didn't make the connexion that Eren would have needed to also turn into a titan to gain his power.

At no moment I thought that titans were humans before the story told me so.

I understood so late that there were humans inside the neck of the colossal, armored and female titan, and not only Eren 😂

And so so much more, the show was brilliant in keeping me clueless

Maybe I was dumb but these aren't thoughts that came to at all while enjoying the serie.

Now I regret it, I wish I could rediscover AOT for the first time again!!!!"
kinekocat,Smooth_Vacation_7760,"Js say "" oh my god u r so right!! I never even noticed"""

kinekocat,concerned_apps,First time watching. i immediately pegged this. The armored lokks exactly like him. I was shocked people thought it was a controversial take at the time. Now Bertholdt being the collosal i didnt see.
kinekocat,Dark_WulfGaming,I thought they looked similar but I gaslit myself to not believe it
kinekocat,Nerdcuddles,I was thinking reiner looked like the armored Rican on my first watch to
kinekocat,IanPKMmoon,"I thought that too, as well as Annie being female titan"
kinekocat,RinZu-chan23dessu,Lol I even thought about it at first and wasn't even sure about it until they confessed to Eren that time. I'm glad I didn't even get spoiled during that time and I'm shocked as hell that my thoughts were all along correct l

kinekocat,_unrealwonder_,I never made that connection myself until I saw the female Titan... I immediately knew that was Annie.

But we didn't know humans can become titans at that point so it's a big jump to make that early I think, though obviously some people make the connection."
kinekocat,Hams_LeShanbi,Me telling my friend the female titan was clearly Annie.
kinekocat,Prestigious-Note4278,https://preview.redd.it/moo1vr1ui2ke1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=adcb07c0539fdb4551cce7935851ec97dfd2a801
kinekocat,DentariBerd,My friend said female titan looks like Annie and I responded yeah. Not realizing that he hasn't watched it.
kinekocat,Particular_Minute_67,Be quiet and let him figure it out
kinekocat,Pseudo_surgeon,"My friend paused the battle between Eren and Reiner after the betrayal reveal to say ""Wait, so all titans have their special powers - like big size, armor, screaming... so what's Eren's? I'd say it's something to do with time"" and my jaw DROPPED. His reasoning was unrelated totge actual story, he assumed this bc of a moment in battle where Eren dodged Reiner's blow and it looked sorta like Reiner was slowed down while Eren wasn't I think. Also he found some other moments to back up the idea. So while the reasoning was completely wrong, he somehow arrived to the correct conclusion.
On other notes - he figured all titans were once people the moment Eren first transformed, nearly instantly knew the Female Titan was Annie, and figured Ymir and Reiner are from a different country behind the walls bc they could read a different language. As much as I wanted him to be surprised by the twists like I was back in the day, it's nice to see your friend being so invested into the things you like that they start theorizing and piecing things together, picking up on hints etc."
kinekocat,Zeropass,"you go ""oh, damn you're right- I never noticed"" 

  
aka. play dumb"
kinekocat,mel2kill,I remember a discussion on a forum where someone guessed all that many episodes before the big reveal in the manga. That person was really paying attention to details.
kinekocat,Emdoodev,"Do you guys ever have friends who guess the craziest shit spot on like this?  
I swear some people look up spoilers to spout so they sound cool"
kinekocat,radiostar316,“hahaha i thought the exact same thing when i first watched it!”
kinekocat,Ralbr2,mf he looks so much like him. I wasn't even mad this post spoiled me because they literally look like brothers
kinekocat,jazzykale,"When situations like this occur, and you can feel your friend scanning your face, it's time to spin a yarn about how Reiner actually isn't the Armoured Titan, and it's just something the author did to fool people experiencing this story for their first time, either that or try acting like they're out of their mind for even suggesting that."
kinekocat,1Grouchy_lemon,I thought the armored titan was hannes 😭💀
kinekocat,IronJackk,"When the first season came out I thought the armored titan looked like Reiner. But then I did the math and was like, he was only 7 years old or something during that time so there's no way it was him. Then Thomas looked like Reiner and I thought I was just seeing things."
kinekocat,AccomplishedDot1118,What? Because he has blond hair?
kinekocat,lari-mars,Its time to gaslight!!!
kinekocat,Azaloq,"I never really understood that look... I don't think characters in AoT emote like normal human beings. Maybe they are supposed to, but they really really don't."
kinekocat,Great_Ad_4862,"Currently at season 3 part 2 (my BF is making me watch the show since its his favorite) and everytime I correctly predicted the titans he tried getting full gaslight mode, its pretty funny

""No way, why would it be Reiner ??"""
kinekocat,black__moses,Damn maybe we just dumb 😭
kinekocat,mutant_goose46,"i did not realize them, but i immediately connected annie and the female titan"
kinekocat,Citrus-Red,That’s what everyone thought who wasn’t a child.
kinekocat,Mabaet,lmao i thought connie is the collosal titan because they're both bald 💀
kinekocat,Slow_Constant9086,even 12 yearts ago people were saying it
kinekocat,BabySealClubber54,My girlfriend consistently would ask me for spoiler like information to the point I would just start saying yes to every crack pot theory she would spew out. Even when she did correctly guess something I’d just tell her “yes” and she would assume I was messing with her and we’d move on.
kinekocat,elusivebonanza,Sometimes watching something and not feeling the need to try and predict everything is more fun
kinekocat,Typicalme2079,"""That's crazy talk! Crazy talk I tell ya!"""
kinekocat,Big_pp_1244,"ME: *turns off TV* ""This isn't fun anymore, just go home."""
kinekocat,staycthegoat,I pretty much called out Annie and Reiner after i learned Eren turned into a titan. Bertholdt and the Jaw titan was surprising though. My friend accused me of seeing it already but I was like dude. They look exactly the same lol
kinekocat,Comfortable_Band9394,![img](emote|t5_2vnp9|54180)
kinekocat,enokaptan21,i thought it was jean
kinekocat,Edgar-11,If you downplay it they may just forget since the plot doesn’t focus on him for a while
kinekocat,LazyGamesInc,"One of the best details about this show is eveytime I made a guess or asked a question the series answered it.

However I still have no idea how the hell did they power the evacuation ships."
ProfessorRigby,AutoModerator,"

ProfessorRigby,Herrmann1309,Last week I started to watch AoT with my parents they are now at S4E6 :)
Herrmann1309,whatuzay,Thats awesome. I hope someday my dad would watch it coz it has everything he likes but the only reason he doesnt watch it is coz its anime
whatuzay,None,My step dad once barged into my room at night while I was watching anime and assumed I was masturbating because all anime is hentai apparently. Then after that got cleared up he asked why don't I just watch in English and left. I love it when parents take an interest in their child's hobbies lol
whatuzay,Herrmann1309,Just let him watch the first episode maybe he get hocked up
whatuzay,NFahey1,I'm 29 and about to be a dad and I hope my kids will watch it with me!
whatuzay,Alphabunsquad,Yah it’s a hard show to show to people because either they have already watched it or they won’t because it’s an anime and the beginning is the most anime esque of all of it
Herrmann1309,Egglord123,They watched the whole thing in a week? Or like you started off w/ a later season
Egglord123,Herrmann1309,Yea we watched all 3 seasons and the new episodes in around ~10 days
Egglord123,Alstoyle,It's not too impossible. Me and my mother watched all of HunterxHunter in 9 days. now THAT seemed impossible

Chisto-Otchki,Peter_Lim,"I wonder why that titan that ate Eren didn't turn to a normal person like what happened to Ymir?

Edit: thanks for the response guys!"
Peter_Lim,frenchfries089,Santa swallowed Eren and not Chew. This is basically a lesson and why to chew your food. Or humans.
Peter_Lim,None,If the titan that ate Eren would have gotten his spinal fluid they would have turned back human and eren would have died
Peter_Lim,kurdish-devil,Because he didn't manage to eat erin's spine
Peter_Lim,None,"'cause you need to swallow the spinal fluid

but santa doesn't chew on his food 

he just straight up swallows"
Peter_Lim,Reggie_156789,he didn't bite eren's spine thats why
Peter_Lim,Chisto-Otchki, perhaps Eren just didn't get digested yet

UncleScummy,VigoMago,Tbf tv episodes (~40 to 60 mins) are at least two or three anime episodes
UncleScummy,None,Why would the dad start with S2? (this is the S2 OP)
neremarine,memerverse1,No I think it means after 2 episodes he becomes as committed as he is seen in the video
neremarine,ShaidarHaran2,"That's also not OPs dad, this has been reposted several times.

Gandalfonk,TheClintonCartel,"As someone who is not into anime, I am so glad I gave this show a try"
Gandalfonk,thejuicee,It was my first anime and brought me into it. Also my favorite by far.

Although we never saw a whale and dinosaur Titan so those might’ve just been made just because why not lol!<"
Chungulungus,warrri,"Actually it goes even further than that: Final chapter spoilers ahead 
>!Since we can see the tree in the final panels growing, it could mean that the titan thingy is in there. It's possibly immortal. That also means it probably existed long before Ymir, say during the dinosaur era. One unlucky dinosaur fell into the hole and became a dinosaur titan. But then an asteroid killed all dinosaurs(the fossil fuels, aka Iceburst stone, that marley talks about is actually dinosaur remains) and the thingy had nowhere to go so it grew a new tree and thats the one Ymir discovered. Thanks for coming to my TED-talk.!<"

warrri,YogurtclosetNo239,"Hallucigenia (idk the spelling) was born in the Cmbrian explosion, wayy before the dinisaurs, and if it really is the source of all organic matter, that would explain your theory.

When animals were not on land and just in the ocean, maybe a prehistoric animal got in contact with it and with the titan powers, he was the first animal to be able to walk on land !!"

genesis1v9,maruseyes,I wonder what Colt's Beast Titan would look like
Jon98th,Firekeeper_,He said in an interview that it shows that all animals dedicate there hearts.

BlackRonin8,devilthedankdawg,"I was always hoping the origin of the titans was that the Eldians used them to overthrow a previous evil empire. I think of the Eldians as a mix of the history of the Jews and Romans. What better a way to further encapsulate that than having them overthrow some cruel Egyptian-like empire?

But if it were the dinosaurs I could get behind that too- Maybe both. Like the Egyptian society’s repillian gods (A la Set and Apophesh) arent just imaginative... they are real beings that walk among them."

nan,xoblivionknight-,"From what I understand, the Beast titan always manifests as a different animal depending on the person.

nan,Cosmic_TentaclePorn,I convinced myself for the longest time that Tom Ksaver was a whale in his beast Titan form untill 4th season rolled in
nan,BatatinhaGameplays28,Imagine having a Mosasaur more accurate than the JW one
nan,SunSet505MC,Nobody knows...
nan,literal-hitler,"With the Tyrannosaurus and Mastodon, maybe that means this will turn into the Power Rangers world?"
literal-hitler,creatorsmonsters3414,A mass of stitched together animals supposed to resemble a man
nan,nmpineda60,"I think it’s something along the lines of “all living things have hearts to give, and will fight/kill/die so that their species can continue to live”"
nan,PillowTalk420,"Titans = Big

Dinosaurs = Big"
nan,Getindarobotshinji,Why are there dinosaurs in the opening?
nan,D0wnVoteMe_PLZ,Why are there dinosaurs in the opening?
nan,Pillowpet123,I thought it was to show how the beast titan was a harbinger of Mother Earth sent to destroy humanity and the beasts represented nature’s wrath destroying humans and how titans were just another part of that
nan,Zach_801,Past shifters that’s what I’m assuming.
nan,Inner-Gain405,It's saying that the titans (or something similar) were there millions of years ago. But more likely it's just badass.
nan,4starters,I always thought it was just showing other animals at the top of their food chain. Like just other massive powerful animals and relating the Titans to another predator
nan,anaheed99,I once heard someone say those are the forms of the previous beast titans. Well idk.
nan,Bird_Boi_Man,"I've had the ""beast titan turns into the animal the user feels a connection to"" theory since this specific scene I feel so vindicated"
nan,FlorinMarian,"Honestly, at first I thought it represented the world being against Paradis, with literally every species hating their guts."
nan,Rigistroni,"I assumed these were past beast titans. Ksaver says his beast Titan isn't suited for combat, but Zeke's clearly is which lends credibility to this theory/headcannon of mine

Falco also mentions long ago a titan that used to fly and he himself gets that ability from Zeke, the beast Titan."
nan,anand_rishabh,"Not just dinosaurs. Am elephant and what looks like 2 flying whales. My theory at the time was these were past beast Titan forms. After all, it seems like the beast Titan takes the form of the users favorite animal."
nan,BleepingCreepers,"I remember seeing this opening and thinking the beast titan would be able to turn animals into titan versions of themselves. Despite it not fitting in the story at all, I still think the idea of animals being able to become titans is a really cool concept."
BleepingCreepers,HeimskrSonOfTalos,"I tbought he could control animals, atleast thats what it implies"
nan,NukaRev,"My thinking was it referencing either evolution or apex predators (though not all of these animals are necessarily apex predators). They're inarguably the largest animals on their environments though, so if anything it implies the Beast Titan is the largest in *it's* environment"
nan,ShuBakuhatsuSatsujin,Because the Beast Titan can turn into any animal. As long as the user adores that animal (zeke likes monkeys) he will become that animal. Fun fact the previous beast Titan was a whale.
ShuBakuhatsuSatsujin,Bird_Boi_Man,"No, Xavier was a ram"
Bird_Boi_Man,ShuBakuhatsuSatsujin,Then why he say he was useless in combat? I don’t read the manga so I got that from someone else sorry.
nan,None,Thank you guys for 15k upvotes! This is now one of the most upvoted posts in this sub.
nan,14Krater14,I always assumed just like how all the other titans looked different with who was the host that the beast titan was just an animal that best fit the current titan host and Zekes was a monkey
nan,AnPerson42,Why are there dinosaurs in the opening?
AnPerson42,potato_coder,They all are former beast titans

nan,Accomplished-Pin-835,"Forget the dinos, I SEE WHALES!!"
nan,Hermit1723,Why are there dinosaurs? I was really hoping for dinosaur titan
nan,queenkayliah,Lol zekes ancestors maybe. Idk
nan,FluffyyKittyy,WELL WE NEED A GODDAMN EXPLANATION
nan,TheFartingKing_56,"Imagine seeing a titan slowly advancing towards a peaceful village when all of a sudden the camera pans right and Rexy just annihilates its jugular vein. In the background, have the Jurassic Park theme play loudly. Lol"
nan,None,I’m disappointed there’s no answer to the dinosaurs…
nan,LeonShiryu,I think you need to study some basic zoology if you think an elephant and a whale are dinosaurs.
nan,my_decaying_mind,"beast titans.


they're past beast titans."
nan,blackveIvet,"First time i watched it, my theory was that some people can be animal shifters 😐"
nan,L0neStarW0lf,I figured it was Because the design of the Spinal Creature that attached itself to Ymir Frits is based on an actual Prehistoric creature (specifically an Aquatic Creature from the Cambrian Period named Hallucigenia).
nan,animegod1004,Wait can whales walk though?
nan,Soft-Chip510,Past Best holders.
nan,None,"I thought it simply meant all life is connected.  Like each living thing in the opening has the glowing hearts, including the dinosaurs.  There was even bugs and other small creatures with the glowing hearts. Eldian, marlyian, animals, bugs, single celled creatures- all life are connected.
A common theme in the show being “lend your hearts.”

Keep in mind I eat crayons"
nan,BurningBuschLight,Don’t forget the charizard
nan,EnderWin,Because beast titan exists
nan,None,It would have been sick to have a t Rex titan
None,None,What with a rabbit Titan? Wouldn't that be also sick? Or a giraffe titan?
nan,DankFo3ta5,"There is not one person who is like ""I don't want this"""
nan,blackhole_puncher,"I think its just because theyre beast. Beasts, beast titan simple but it works"
nan,_Straw_Hat_Nami_,"people have said but i think it represents the beast titans of the past, since they arent all monke per se, in the same way that galliard and ymir had the same titan yet it looks way different"
nan,ThrowRA-Abbrevi1677,AOT just wishes it was an 80s cartoon.
nan,ASpaceOstrich,"People talking about how it's different beast titan forms. But Zekes Titan is an apelike humanoid, not a literal monkey. This intro is obviously showing predators, which is why there are whales in there as well."
ASpaceOstrich,brrrrrgrrrrr,Ah yes showing well know Apex predators like parasaurolophus and zebras
nan,Electric_Cello,"Thats _all_ your asking?…

_-Eva fans_"
nan,None,"There’s also a moose, I think it’s to show that humans are insignificant"
None,None,[removed]
None,None,Truuue…
nan,Farva1631,"Life, uhhh, finds a way."
nan,Doorknob_55,Former beast titans?
nan,xXDuckyMoMoXx25,Because dinosaurs got a prob?
nan,Doorknob_55,If youve seen former beast titan before zeke....
nan,Sir_Meliodas_92,Aren't they just iterations of the beast titan?
nan,None,I think it’s to show the connection of animals through the beast titan.
nan,Sameer_Rana,I believe because they are Titans of the past
nan,SerraxAvenger,"To show how big in scale the Titans are compared to things we know about.

To give us perspective before we see them in action. 

Duhhhhhh"
nan,-Broccoli_,Rawr
nan,geozo19,back in the day when I dont read the manga I thought that animals was the reasons behind the titans that causes plague in the world and humans almost become extinct.
nan,BillyBobJenkins454,"Maybe to show the strength of the titans? Like, fighting the titans in this season will be as hard as fighting these animals"
nan,TheProphetOfMusic,Maybe they just like Dinosaur King
nan,None,I assumed it was representing humanity's conflict with the whole world.
nan,drguy13,Maybe it's just there to show a sense of scale for the Titian's compared to things that we know that are big
nan,eti67u,"Ikr like I would of loved to see Eren bating the fuck out of a massive T-Rex titan shifter but noooo that ""wouldn't be relevant to the plot"""
eti67u,CouldWouldShouldBot,"It's 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!"
CouldWouldShouldBot,eti67u,Good bot
nan,Darksponge044,Cause dinosaurs are cool
nan,Lessiie,I have always thought it is to show the size of titans
nan,Shivam_uchiha,(Manga spoiler)         Wait isn’t this the >! RUMBLING COZ WE CAN SEE HUMANS BEING CRUSHED!<
nan,Desperate-Idea706,At least dinosaurs are land reptiles why the heck is there two whale out of their habitat
nan,deadly_beast,Different beast titans?
nan,OL_Blood,Just imagine how big that T Rex was dude
nan,iceycoolman1,Only Ymir knows…
nan,Awfulmasterhat,This always upset me. A lot of people I know stopped watching the show because they thought it was getting dumb with dino titans and stuff...
nan,Metallic_Ducki07,To represent the beast titan
nan,bombaleyyo,I thought that the beast titan was going to control all the animals lol
nan,Its_Just_Memi,"U
Yeah why are there dinosaurs in the opening??"
nan,GlobalEdNinja,The best explanation I've seen for this was that these animals just represent the forms of previous holders of the Beast Titan.
nan,Kuxaro,Caveman banged dinosaur and thus an titan was born
nan,XxPorcelainDollxX,I see a weird looking monke 🤔
nan,GTwarfare,Welll
nan,Redstone145,Probably represents the power or similarity for each titan.
nan,None,i got so hyped for them all to appear but i was let down
nan,dakman42,I always viewed it as a sense of scale. Like yeah Titans are really big and stuff but so we're dinosaurs so not all of them are outside of the range of possibility of being that big. Like beast Titan is just a little bit bigger than a T-Rex which was in no way on the bigger end of the dinosaur scale.
nan,Kryptonian42,"Well the first time I saw this my guess was these are the known beast titan forms(because Monke was with them)...we'll get to see one in the upcoming season. So there's that. Although i think half of those designs are impractical, maybe except the T-Rex and Mosasaurus(when water is involved) oh and the one we're gonna see in S4 part 2."
nan,scrimmybingus3,What do you wanna bet some artist doodled this in their free time and they thought it looked cool so they stuck it in the intro.
nan,Hunted-Dragon,to represent the beast titan can take any form
nan,CozzaTheBean,I figured it was just symbolic of evolution.
nan,StornZ,Me: I understand why there are dinosaurs in the opening.
nan,BigIron28,Do the other beast titans look exactly like their animal type?
nan,DeJellybeans,It means something!
nan,mita_amrita,Best is the flying blue whale
nan,None,"It's literally to represent all life forms

I can't tell you more cause it would be a spoiler"
nan,IWantTooDieInSpace,"JAEGER HUNTER JAGER DINO-SORE!!!

That's how the intro goes right?"
nan,AlphaChan77,Imagine if Zeke was a fucking T-Rex🥵🥵
nan,_Don-Corleone_,Those are all the Beast Titans before and after Zeke
nan,GMAN25639,"I mean, I'm more concerned about the flying whale but aight"
nan,AtifBoss1,Ancient beast titan ig
nan,ClosetedCardboard,It resembles the fossils marley wants to get from paradis.i hope this answered your question.
nan,dilutedsaltwater,my cousin told me the beast titan could be anything like the next person to inherit it can become a dino or a whale but idk probably not true
nan,None,Because Japan
nan,National-Oven81,Dah powa of dah beast has all animals including monke
nan,DaGeBoo,Why there is Dinosaur in the opening
nan,MhRabVevo2,MAPPA: *Good Question*
nan,hashwardone,Yeah never mentioned it
nan,JaimeL_,"They stand for the fossil fuels Marley want off of Eldia, I think."
nan,YektaNSR,yeha whyy😑
nan,to1M,you'll understand if you read the manga
nan,Sir-Shork,idk why but it intimidates me
nan,oxomiya_lora,Wait isn't those just to show the previous animal appearances of the beast titan?
nan,RouxGinger,Read the manga or keep watching further and you'll understand
nan,Ironspider420,Because dinosaurs are cool and AOT is cool
nan,the-graveyard-writer,Because titans
nan,No_Arm9832,There was a titan shifter whale and a trex yooooooooo imagen if they were huge like the whale titan was a solid 30m long
nan,SweetPotatoPie476,"I think all the animals represent all the past beast titan, so there possibly could have been a  east titan themed after a t rex."
nan,3chxes,I took it as the bond that links all of the chosen together links not just humans but multiple species and this link started back in the dinosaur times
nan,Deeprest03,all beast titans throughout history?
nan,Hashirama_senju_z,Are we gonna ignore the whale and giraffe?
nan,None,"No no, i think the question should be why is there a fucking flying whale?"
nan,Pranav_HEO,"I think it's meant to represent and also state that titans aren't the only human eating species to exist throughout history, just a cool little way to show that there are other animals that were at one point higher than humans on the food chain"
nan,Llibius,"I think that there are animals because the beast titan isn't a monkey but is the favorite animal of the owner of the titan, do if someone liked dinosaurs the titan would be a dinosaur."
nan,None,Spoilers: because the beast titan can take many forms and these some of them. You'll see them later.
nan,BodolftheGnome,Big
nan,corgibrofistsyou,I think they are for scale... Just like bananas
nan,MyLifesAJoke0_0,When I saw that intro I was like tf now they got a mf dinosaur titan
nan,powsea1,Lol i totally forgot about that.. My thoughts at the time was the those were the previous beast titans
nan,Herodegon,Extinction or something idk go watch Jurassic Park
nan,pizzaman121,DINOSAUR TITAN!! That all I saw for months when this opening came out
nan,EdgarMarkhov,Only Ymir knows
nan,Mahatma_Handy,"The whale titan would be so good for military purposes. You stop any kind of sea trade and you have control over the fucking oceans.
Imagine Napoleon jumping from the ship biting his finger, and a sudden thunder breaks the sky. Oh boy you are dead."
nan,Maradock101,Only ymir knows🤫😌
nan,None,Um u missed zoro..
nan,Wardog_Razgriz30,Ymir used paths to fuck a few dinosaurs in her time.
nan,M-akkusu,"I was confused at first, but it’s basically showing the last beats Titans and what animals they took after"
nan,AlphaOmega2k21,iirc every beast titan that died became their favorite animal or sum
nan,Memo544,Cause dinosaurs are cool
nan,knifeazz,A former form of the beast titan
nan,__Precursor__,Human evolution representation?
nan,rabidjworlds,Cus it’s cool
nan,StatMaster131,Why is there a giant flying whale in the opening?
nan,PomegranateMaterial,I swear that still an ansolved mystery
nan,PeterLeRock101,Probably hinting at former B Titans
nan,Thediamondhandedlad,They’re all variations of the beast Titan
nan,amanjahandari,No one knows ngl
nan,RandomNoLifeboy,when i saw this i thought the beat titan was gonna show up with a tyrannosaur and flying whales recking the shit out of the scouts
nan,Maleficent-Kiwi-4844,Only Ymir knows
nan,TheSaurianTaco,"Not only that, there’s also a Mosasaur and a Plesiosaur, most likely Mosasaurus and Elasmosaurus.

Honestly surprised the didn’t add a Quetzalcoatlus."
nan,Master-Powers,"Because that glowing thing was the source of all life, so it's just representation of its breadth"
nan,Spacemonster111,Fr it made me think the beast titan’s powers were to control animals or something
nan,TinyAd2706,"People says they're the past beast titans, but I don't really see it, like, what's the point? And they don't even look like beast titans, and what's the reason of the red dots? It's not the vital point, since titans don't have a heart, their weak point is behind the head"

Arks_PowerPlay,justaverage00,I need a part 2 unless the movie's gonna be 5+ hours
Arks_PowerPlay,Eustacean,Animation better be as smooth as Levi versus Kenny scene
Arks_PowerPlay,emailo1,"I really hope a part 2, i dont want to wait like 6 months for it to realease outside japan"
Arks_PowerPlay,None,[deleted]
None,PmYourWittyAnecdote,"Fuck that, there’s no way they could do it justice in a movie. Why would we ever want that and not the show which has done an amazing job adapting so far..?"
None,hushpolocaps69,This. The only good thing about a film is the high budget.
Arks_PowerPlay,Clickbaiting_4_u,Idk why people want movie instead of just episodes. It becomes confusing
Arks_PowerPlay,Adaphion,"There is no fucking chance that they wrap up everything in 22 minutes, like, hell >!Zeke probably won't even be done regenerating by the end of the episode!< I will be pissed if they do the same shit The Promised Neverland did and cram everything into a single episode"
Arks_PowerPlay,ridik_ulass,not cour 2?
Arks_PowerPlay,w_heliummm,I will be looking forward to coming back commenting “You called it bro!”
Arks_PowerPlay,Flnn,This will unfortunately be the series finale.
Arks_PowerPlay,gokudragon22,I hope it's not a movie I'd rather have part 2
martien20,wyattmason,"Bruh there’s most likely going to be a part 2...they can’t finish it with a single episode and even a movie wouldn’t be long enough to capture it all, a part 2 is most likely happening"
wyattmason,FlotationDevice,I think these 16 episode's we have gotten are covering chapters 91 through 116 in the manga (25 chapters). Theoretically a part 2 would cover chapters 117 through 139 (22 chapters). There's definitely enough story for a part 2
FlotationDevice,emailo1,That or a 4 hour long movie
wyattmason,MrShaddowz,There is going to be a part 2. But OP means last attack on titan Sunday for this season
MrShaddowz,quietandproud,But isn't this The final season? Says so in the opening.
wyattmason,gottlikeKarthos,"""most likely"" aka defenitely"
martien20,iamstarwolf,Time to finally start watching
iamstarwolf,martien20,"Appreciate the journey, I wish I was you"
martien20,iamstarwolf,I watched season 1 a long time ago and started season 2 as it aired but it was a slow burn and I couldn't get into it. Now that it's ending and I can binge it all I'm finally ready.
iamstarwolf,stolenrobotgorilla,I like your style.
iamstarwolf,encoredme,"I just watched the whole series, a - z"
martien20,MrShaddowz,Last attack on titan Sunday and manga chapter... too much sadness in one month
MrShaddowz,PrisonIssuedSock,"Wdym last manga chapter? I’m out of the loop, is the manga finishing on Sunday?"
PrisonIssuedSock,I_am_Feli,The last chapter is gonna come out in April
PrisonIssuedSock,ApolloX-2,"Yeah you should read the Manga, it’s really ending in chapter and the anime is good that you can basically pick up where they leave off."
MrShaddowz,Celegorm07,As a warrior no road left but the one that leads to the end.

martien20,None,There has to be a part 2 or a movie. No way they wrap it up in 22-25 minutes.
martien20,JoeSantoasty,Spain without the S
martien20,Shattered_Sans,"In my timezone, it's still saturday.

^(And I still think Shingeki No Sunday sounds better than ""Attack on Titan sunday"")"
Shattered_Sans,Natsume-Grace,">Shingeki No Sunday

Nice, I like it. Let's use it when season 4 part 2 is airing 🤞🏼"
Shattered_Sans,Bombkirby,"Even if AoT is kind of dumb and English, using the native title just makes me roll my eyes. I have a friend who always interjects and “corrects” us when we refer to anime with their English titles. 

“Have you guys seen the new My Hero Academ-“

“Boku no Hīrō Akademia”

“...ia.”

Just comes off as conceited since no other medium deals with this treatment regarding titles. You can play Super Smash Bros in the west and you’ll never hear anyone refer to it as “Nintendo All Star! Dairantō Smash Brothers” for example."
Bombkirby,Shattered_Sans,"That's fair enough, but I don't think there's any problem with referring to a show with it's English title. I just think that ""Shingeki no Sunday"" sounds better than ""Attack on Titan Sunday"". Partially because it's shorter, and partially because ""Shingeki"", and ""Sunday"" both start with S."
Bombkirby,YM_Industries,"""Correcting"" someone for using the translated title is stupid, but I don't think there's anything wrong with using the native title."

martien20,monferno786,"There’s gotta be a part two, a movie can’t cover what’s left and if it did I feel it wouldn’t do it justice."
martien20,gazebo-fan,There will 100% be a past two. There is simply too much left to go through. From the amount of manga chapters that go into each episode it should take a good three or four more episodes after this weeks one to catch up to the manga as of right now.
gazebo-fan,kingreq,Three or four episodes? At least double that for sure.
kingreq,gazebo-fan,Man everyone is talking about how they want a movie despite a movie giveing us less content over all. Unless it’s going to be a four hour movie or so I don’t think a movie could end the series
kingreq,MarkoRoot2,"Bullshit. Not less then 13-14 episodes.

Manga has 22 chapters left.

S4 part 1 covered ~25 chapetrs."
martien20,None,[removed]
None,theflyingkiwi00,Or the anime just jumps ahead in time with no explanation of why or what happened in that time to Erin turning into a titan before the end credits
theflyingkiwi00,emailo1,That would be just awful
theflyingkiwi00,chloe_003,That would literally cause so much backlash it would be insane. If Mappa wants to receive the worst feedback imaginable and anger everybody- then i guess that would be a good way to end the show
martien20,SirBing96,"A friend was telling me it’s not the actual final season, but maybe just part one. Part two or a movie will possibly follow? Not sure where he heard it from though, so take with a grain of salt"

martien20,Tension-Smooth,"Has Isayama mentioned why there's only 139 chapters? I can't google it because all that comes up are spoilers. NGL, I can't help but feel like he's up to something... to make it worse, by ending the manga and the series in the span of two weeks does sound like something he'd do"
Tension-Smooth,martien20,I can't explain without spoiling you :(
martien20,Tension-Smooth,Thank you good redditor for not spoiling it. I appreciate you.
Tension-Smooth,emailo1,"The anime will definetely have a part 2 or movie, they cant cover 115 to 139 on one episode (and yes the manga ends on 139)"

NoSurprises4,PmYourWittyAnecdote,"Unsure if we’re getting part 2 or a movie yet, but part 2 seems far more likely than movie."
martien20,Natural_Side_7550,"Part 2 has been announced, coming winter 2022"

jojo2005146,emailo1,Im pretty sure its not ending
emailo1,Marcus9T4,They haven’t announced it yet but most likely will be a part 2 same as season 3. Some people think a movie but I think there’s too much for that.
martien20,Thuspleasesthenut,I seriously read that as The last today is attack on Titian Sunday
martien20,None,Wait is season 4 going to be in 2 parts?
martien20,None,How are they gonna fit that many chapters into 1 episode
martien20,Leonhardt_309,"What if at the end, instead of ""to be continued..."" we get ""to be continued?"" with no announcement just to really fuck with fans"

martien20,Zeddyy101,There HAAAAS to be a part 2. There's so much unanswered questions and so much events to cover in just 20ish minutes.
martien20,Nicost4r,"if any anime onlies don’t want to sit through the grueling wait for part 2 or a possible movie. Part 1 of the anime will end on chapter 116 of the manga. So if you want to know what happens afterwards, pick it up from there. There’s 2 main websites you can read the full manga. Just type in Google “Read Shingeki” And two of the websites will pop up. Either works."
martien20,ecxetra,Spoiler: Its not
martien20,svahn52,"There's either gonna be a part 2 or a movie announced, the manga is too far ahead to catch up unless this ep is like 3 hours long."
martien20,unqualifiedromantic,Why do you guys think today’s episode will be the last? Every season so far has had either 20-something  episodes or 12 in the case of season 2. Today’s will be number 16 in season 4. Wouldn’t it make sense they’d go to at least 22?
martien20,ThOtKiLlEr_69,This aged like fine wine
martien20,Aggravating-Rich168,"I just started the series and though I was gonna binge the whole thing, but yesterday I found out there was a second part to season 4. But I already started rewatching... *sadness*"

martien20,Arrow_Maestro,Attack on Titan: The Final Season 2: Even Final-er
martien20,KingCrow87,"Question without being hounded please... 

Why do people hate the movie idea? Each episode is about 20-25 mins. Then, they’re a direct continuation of the previous episode.

Is it just because it will end faster? It will throw off the series being all episodes? Or it will be rushed to fit into about 2 hours? Something like that?"
KingCrow87,Marcus9T4,"It would be crammed in and rushed and the series is paced for chapters/episodes. Imagine like the final series of Breaking Bad being a movie, the pacing would be totally different. Can’t have end of episode cliffhangers etc."
KingCrow87,PmYourWittyAnecdote,It would be hugely rushed.
martien20,P180206,I think we will have more anime chapters later.

martien20,w3are138,Oh man. I wonder how long it will be until they animate the ending. I’ve literally been watching since 2013 since the very first ep aired and after s1 ended I started reading the manga. It has been a journey. I’m literally going to cry when the final chapter comes out.

Ittehad_Islam_Antor,hundenkattenglassen,"This scene is so great it’s kinda hard to fully appreciate it. Music, speech, the depth of it all, just perfect for such a reveal. 

Also loves Mikasa’s reaction. She doesn’t give 0.5 shits if she’s been in the same unit with them for years (IIRC?) the microsecond she sees the smoke she’s already cutting throats and decapitates hands like she’s been in a constant “Wish a motherfucker would”-mood and just found *two* motherfuckers that in fact, would."
hundenkattenglassen,Ittehad_Islam_Antor,Yeah epic moment and badass Mikasa
hundenkattenglassen,samsab,"""Wish a motherfucker would mood""

Ah, the Ackerman effect"
hundenkattenglassen,buzzurro,But she didn't! She esitated because they were her friends. It is one of the things i appreciate more of that scene. That and eren with his tears flowing backwards.
hundenkattenglassen,Longdong_McGee,Mikasa didn't kill them though. Then cries about holding back.

HellspawnedJawa,whitewolf0158,I've started the show again from the start and with the added context of the later seasons it hits that much harder.
whitewolf0158,MissCatValkyrie,"Seeing them smile makes me want to sob,,,,"
MissCatValkyrie,whitewolf0158,The soundtrack hammers home the feels. At no point does the music feel out of place.
MissCatValkyrie,QuarantineSucksALot,Seeing this live was special can’t sing.
MissCatValkyrie,bretstrings,"Its probably not going to happen but I want a happy ending. The characters have suffered so much already, I just want them to catch a break."
MissCatValkyrie,Kidney__Failure,Season 3 episode 12.... just the little break they all get and spend time together is enough to make me cry for two days straight
whitewolf0158,KaiBannon,I just finished rewatching it! Its absolutely crazy how many hints the dudes from Marley dropped that are impossible to catch the first time through
KaiBannon,MissCatValkyrie,"Yeah! Like how insanely interested Annie, Bertholt, and Reiner were in Eren. I just assumed it’s because they liked him. Especially when he first transforms."
KaiBannon,le_snikelfritz,Recently rewatched it all and it was like a totally different experience
whitewolf0158,code_smart,gonna do this next. i did it every season.
whitewolf0158,swalgo,"Ya I had just rewatched the whole show in like 2-3 days a week back, The foreshadowing was right in your face and I had never noticed it the first time over. I enjoyed the show so much more with the added context tbh."
swalgo,whitewolf0158,The first season as a stand alone does feel quite confusing outside of the basic plot of walls falling and awesome fights. Once all the side plots start kicking later on I feel the first season shines all the better.
whitewolf0158,Daxvis,I stopped around S2E5 the first time I watched AOT and when I saw Marco being optimistic I was just like 😞
whitewolf0158,None,I'll wait until it's over to have the full picture. This will be amazing to rewatch!
None,whitewolf0158,I'll do that as well but probably in a year's time. I'm doing the recap for the final season as there's a lot I'd forgotten from the earlier seasons that I should probably have in mind for the last one.
whitewolf0158,Doppelkrampf,Really? Was debating restarting it but I thought it might ruin it
whitewolf0158,jacksonacosta2004,I finished the show the second time in 5days💀
whitewolf0158,None,Have you seen the OVA's as well?
HellspawnedJawa,brtomn,"both, both is good"
HellspawnedJawa,Jakefiz,"Honestly this latest episode is the only one where I felt that. The rest have been screaming heart pounding hype, especially 5 6 and 7."
Jakefiz,BabyBoiTHOThrasher69,How are you going to tell me you didn’t cry when Reiner was begging Eren to kill him?
BabyBoiTHOThrasher69,None,[removed]
BabyBoiTHOThrasher69,Kidney__Failure,"I feel really bad for Reiner, I can't help but feel like he's on the wrong side of it all and that he doesn't want to kill anyone. What makes it hurt more is that because of the 13 year curse he'll likely never get to redeem himself"
HellspawnedJawa,None,"Hey man, as much as I love AoT, it’s great to watch something that isn’t borderline depressing and nihilistic"
None,HellspawnedJawa,"I'd say that AoT is the opposite of nihilistic actually. A recurring theme is fighting for survival/freedom in the face of a brutal world. One of my favourite quotes to this point, is from season 1, where Eren says: “If you win, you live. If you lose, you die. If you don’t fight, you can’t win!”"
HellspawnedJawa,Sticky_Pasta,"I’m not 100% sure but doesn’t mikasa say something similar in s1(during the battle of trost)? I can’t remember exactly but I think it’s similar, which further proves the recurring theme/overall theme"
HellspawnedJawa,snappyego,Depends on what you mean by Nihilism
HellspawnedJawa,None,Don't worry MHA will catch up to AOT soon enough
None,HellspawnedJawa,"Me, an anime-only MHA fan:

HellspawnedJawa,Kidney__Failure,"I started MHA because I needed something uplifting and lighthearted after AoT.... but now you're making me worried, I just started season 4"
None,NicTrill_24,My hero’s arc you’re talking about is good but in no way shape or form does it “catch up” to AOT it’s not even close. I’d say Black Clover’s arc comes closer then my hero.
None,interestingly_bored,Really? I am willing to be spoiled- but please like censor it for the children!
interestingly_bored,_PM_ME_YOUR_BOOBIES-,">!Around 20 named characters die (though not all important), a few cities got rumbled (no I’m not making that up), the strongest villain in the world basically cloned himself, the main villain gained the ability to destroy cities by touching the ground near said city, and society came *this* close to collapsing!<"

HellspawnedJawa,DaveInLondon89,*Sad shinsou wo sasayago noises*
DaveInLondon89,ms_103127,*Sad intro violin or cello sounds from like Season 2*
HellspawnedJawa,BoozerX,"Since Eren was eaten in season 1 I gave up all hope, hope eventually come back in the fight with Annie and OG Levi Corps and was totally crushed since then.

Those deaths really hurt, fuck."
BoozerX,beepbeepbubblegum,"I started getting into it when they surprise threw it in on Netflix back in like 2014? I think, whenever it was.

I had a day off I had faintly heard about the show and I said I’d watch an episode or two and then head out. 

Like 10 hours later I’m still in bed and I had watched the entire season straight through.

I added it to my sisters profile who was on my account and she did the exact same thing.

But I was on an anime hiatus for a long time so I was a complete sucker, I thought Eren did actually die and that Armin was probably going to take over as the protagonist. Boy was I naive."
HellspawnedJawa,NOOBSDUDETO,i binged the manga from chap 107 to 137 in 1 hr and it was depressing
NOOBSDUDETO,BroskyGaming,That's not binging that's speed reading
BroskyGaming,NOOBSDUDETO,no its actually just finger exercise

HellspawnedJawa,swolpatrol,"First anime I’ve watched is AOT, anything similar out there?"
swolpatrol,NicTrill_24,"The promise neverland MANGA is def on the level of AOT for me in terms of uniqueness, and that feeling of nobody is safe. It’s in my Top 3 now with AOT tied for 1st, just waiting on AOT to end to see which is my number 1 ."
NicTrill_24,Abh1laShinigami,"It dropped off hard during the end though, but still way better than the second season of the anime"
swolpatrol,thelastcurrybender,"On Netflix watch Demonslayer it is SO good and has very good character moments, epic moments, and reasons for everything. Highly recommend"
swolpatrol,nikecat,Not quite the same but Claymore was really enjoyable.
HellspawnedJawa,Rhundis,Re:Zero can challenge that.
HellspawnedJawa,IrishKookaburra,"sigh, so true lol."
HellspawnedJawa,None,so true lmao
HellspawnedJawa,SquidzSleepToo,I’m scared for who will be next
HellspawnedJawa,kazetoame,"Yup, pretty much."
HellspawnedJawa,wue_saphiens,Exactly
wue_saphiens,QuarantineSucksALot,Exactly what you want. This is gold🤯
HellspawnedJawa,BigMorningWud,I’m actually scared every time a new episode comes out
HellspawnedJawa,EnvironmentalOrchid9,I'm scared of the next episode m8. It doesn't matter when you are reading this.
HellspawnedJawa,j3rgan,Maybe I'm just evil or something because that Deku is absolutely literally me when a new aot episode comes out.
j3rgan,HellspawnedJawa,"Nah, I'd say personally I cycle between the two depending on what happened in the last episode"
HellspawnedJawa,Samaton2000,Beku is me every time a new episode of Horimiya drops. And Gandalf is me every time the episode ends
Samaton2000,HellspawnedJawa,"Gandalf? lol

Edit: Nevermind, I just got the joke"
HellspawnedJawa,Kino-22,"After the episode that came out last week I said “screw it I’ll just read the manga because I’m hungry for more AOT”, but now all I feel is pain😃"
HellspawnedJawa,code_smart,so true. and i have to say it's unique to this anime. can't think of anything else like this.
HellspawnedJawa,None,Next episode will be explaining stuff like how they got guns
None,dWaldizzle,They had guns already? Kenny's crew were all carrying them + bars had them behind the counter.
dWaldizzle,Tsar_Romanov,They had muzzleloader single shot type weapons. The leap to semi auto pistols took mankind centuries where paradis did it in four years lol. Damn eldian devils
None,HellspawnedJawa,You should probably spoiler tag this
HellspawnedJawa,None,Not much of a spoiler tbh
HellspawnedJawa,bluefire-phoenix,"Baby Deku is so cute., Is it weird I am mostly like the top panel for new chapter/episode of AoT"
HellspawnedJawa,DarthPizza66,Yes.
HellspawnedJawa,Unparallelium,Jokes on you! I'm also a Re:Zero fan.
HellspawnedJawa,None,I wouldn’t have it any other way

HellspawnedJawa,THYIdiotSandwich,I was mainly targeting Naruto with this comment
HellspawnedJawa,TheeClassyFratBoiii,This is uncomfortably accuratea 😭
HellspawnedJawa,amanjahandari,He knows to much
HellspawnedJawa,IAstronomical,AoT is pretty sad but Re:zero takes the cake for the most heartbreaking shit I’ve ever seen tbh.
HellspawnedJawa,TamTamaa,"For real. In the previous episodes I couldn’t root for them completely. They had badass scenes but it wasn’t satisfying and felt uncomfortable. Especially, Pieck’s panzer unit. That was sad. It felt like Levi’s squad dying all over again. They were a team fighting together all these years and despite the fact that she’s an eldian and they are marleyans they respected and followed her. 

It could be because Reiner is my all time favorite but the new characters grew on me too. This really shows us how powerful the story-telling of this anime is. Wow."
TamTamaa,Warkiller646,"Yeah, I feel sad for both the Marleyan Eldians and Paradis Eldians. Also I don’t want any of the Warriors, Gabi and Falco to die."
HellspawnedJawa,CryptoRogerX,"(╯︵╰,)"
HellspawnedJawa,__lulu,it reminds me of my ex 🥺
HellspawnedJawa,Confetti_Funfetti,Ok who's dying in this episode?
HellspawnedJawa,NeedleworkerHot7662,*Crying intensifies*
HellspawnedJawa,Sabernot,"this is so true. when ever I watch any other show, i'm always happy when a new episode comes out, but when I watch AOT... fear"
HellspawnedJawa,PointlessPupil,That fuckface who killed sasha... i want her dead so bad
PointlessPupil,c4at,>!gabi gang gabi gang gabi gang gabi gang!<
HellspawnedJawa,ZippZappZippty,Technically no since there could be more like it
HellspawnedJawa,poiqwert426,At this point it's not about content. Personally I wish all anime got the netflix treatment. I hate waiting every so fucking much. Especially attack on titan finish and ep and having to wait is brutal
HellspawnedJawa,Creasingdrip40,I can't figure out if I should watch AOT or the Superbowl.
Creasingdrip40,HellspawnedJawa,That shouldn't even be a question
HellspawnedJawa,Creasingdrip40,"For me it is, i love football but AOT is GOAT"
HellspawnedJawa,Raven2001,>!Chainsaw man!< once the anime drops
HellspawnedJawa,shortt0es,eremika shippers are gonna explode next episode
HellspawnedJawa,Shamuthewhaler,i don't understand why people are upset. Anyone care to explain?
Shamuthewhaler,HellspawnedJawa,"I don't think anyone's upset, the joke here is just that AoT can be pretty brutal and depressing at times, in contrast to most other animes which are a lot lighter in terms of themes and stuff."
HellspawnedJawa,Shamuthewhaler,First episode you see Carla getting eaten while Eren is forced to flee due Hannes coming to the sudden realisation of his fear. Not sure why people didn't expect this anime to be brutal.
HellspawnedJawa,RoscoMan1,"If true, this is bloody accurate, m8."
HellspawnedJawa,QuarantineSucksALot,I been liftin way too long trying to make

kuma_potato,trell1212,Damn he honestly got really lucky that his manga got picked up with those drawing skills in the left photo. The hours he put in to improve that fast must be crazy.
trell1212,Boredwitch,IIRC Isayama even got a manga award for « the worst drawings » the year snk came out. Must’ve irked a little.
Boredwitch,None,[removed]
trell1212,GetMekdBro,"apparently his eventual editor told him his ideas were great but he needed to learn to draw for another year first. And every meeting Isayama had with that editor they would ask him 50-100 questions about the story and if he couldn’t answer immediately they’d ask the same question again the next meeting until he could quickly and confidently answer, so that’s part of why the stories’ so thought out"
trell1212,awesomecooper,I think it should a badge of honour. Despite of his lack of skill in drawing his manga still became the peak of Manga's.

Senzo__,None,That’s why Reiner is a good person to have as a favorite character
None,4ty4s,lmao poor guy couldn’t die if he tried
None,Walkingontheblock,I had him as my favorite character then felt betrayed and settled for Jean. Now I just hope for the best.
Senzo__,ShadowWolf202,How could anyone watch S1 and think that plot armor exists in this show? So many deaths. AoT is harder on its cast than Game of Thrones.
ShadowWolf202,Jeremy_StevenTrash,"To be fair tho, a lot of those early deaths were characters who barely got development. Besides the Levi squad, the only major ""death"" in season 1 was Eren, who is subsequently revived a few episodes later."
Jeremy_StevenTrash,vk136,Marco too
ShadowWolf202,Bluebird3415,I mean there's still a bit of plot armor kinda. Look at Reiner S1. it's given explanation wayyy later but watching Riener get out of Annie's hand looked kinda bs at the time
Senzo__,None,[deleted]

None,MhKhay,"Is miche the one who was killed by the weird looking baby titan or the ones the beast titan commanded, i thought his name was mike"
MhKhay,LUVISRAGE1987,Yeah he fell off the building right into it’s mouth and then the Beast took his ODM
MhKhay,YaboiGh0styy,They changed it to Mike in the dub but it’s still Miche in the sub. It doesn’t matter what you call him though he is the same character.
MhKhay,SurprisePNK,sniff sniff nose man is my name for him.
None,EugeneNicoNicoNii,"Yeah, the second strongest soldier of Eldia, died by getting yeet by a horse thrown by a Monke and devoured, like really?"

Senzo__,AbbreviationsTight76,Isayama already killed off my favorite character so I’m just prepared for the worst at this point
Senzo__,DskKing1243,Season 4: Attack On Titan more like Attack On Marley.
Senzo__,YaboiGh0styy,"I was hoping Kieth Shadis would live but if he isn’t dead now I don’t hold out much hope for him. Leader characters don’t really have a reputation for living in this show like Erwin, Zachary, Marcel, and probably Nile because of Zeke’s spinal fluid. Maybe Jean will die but hopefully not he has character development."
YaboiGh0styy,MhKhay,Keith is unarguably the best side character
MhKhay,YaboiGh0styy,He’s one of my favourite side character’s. I love his voice is in both dub and sub the sub gives an intimidating voice that scream authority and the dub made him a drill Sargent and I love it. I wish we got more of him but there isn’t more of his story to tell it’s ashame really because he’s a really good character.
Senzo__,Light0nFire,After last Sunday I’ll genuinely be surprised (and happy as hell) if they don’t end up killing Levi. Those eps were too stressful

Edit: it was actually 4 years! Damn!!"
None,JZ0898,Almost exactly 4 years.
Anuj_Purohit,None,The worst part is avoiding manga spoilers for that long
Anuj_Purohit,3maiga,I just realized I know for sure that Eren was lying about hating Mikasa and surely isn't gonna go with Zeke's euthenasia plan. Remember when Eren Kruger gave Grisha the Attack Titan? He said to Grisha 'only this way you are gonna save Mikasa and Armin'. We know that titan inheritors can acces future titan owners' memories and sure as hell wouldn't that memory have been that important for Kruger to say if in the end Eren Yaeger would just kill all the eldians... Im not a manga reader so don't spoil but fellow anime watchers please tell me what you all think!

Anuj_Purohit,triceratopsdude,And how they ended it as well
Anuj_Purohit,None,cant wait for attack on titan the FINAL final season

Anuj_Purohit,Wakuwaku7,Why call this season final if it aint final yet.
Anuj_Purohit,hxnterchristian,i was under the impression s4 was the last season. hence why it’s called “the final season”.
Anuj_Purohit,Miv333,So you're saying a 5th season. Because that's what this is.
Anuj_Purohit,captain-deadpool_19,I've heard that the last ep is gonna be like a movie long?

Anuj_Purohit,Delano7,Well atleast the wait is pretty short. Not even a full year.
Anuj_Purohit,Alexandre_Man,And from April 9th to the end the season we gotta avoid spoiler of the end of the story.

It's funny how i have the willpower to stay away from the manga but not enough will power to keep up my diet and exercising lol!"
Anuj_Purohit,Donnie619,You can't even begin to comprehend the meaning of the word wait xD
Anuj_Purohit,TheGreatDeadFoolio,I thought it was over. I have been waiting for it to end so I could watch the whole thing. Now there’s another season?
Anuj_Purohit,prabha293,The only more painful thing would be dodging manga spoilers. After Apr 8th I'm leaving the internet and settling in the cave until 2022 😂😂😂

fayekin,None,The Epic Cooking arc with Sasha
fayekin,Self_World_Future,I mean it’s OVAs we’re pretty good side stories. If they were told through regular episodes they probably could have been a bit more fleshed out.
Self_World_Future,Tripechake,No Regrets is more enjoyable than most of the actual episodes imo.
fayekin,None,[deleted]
None,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"I agree in principle. But Attack on Titan animation is so intensive the studios can't finish a season in one shot. And a season of Titan that had neither world-shattering plot revelations (since it's filler), nor the expensive stuff like ODM gear nor Titans, wouldn't really deliver on what makes it so special"
None,CloudCollapse,"Shows that do/did this (Naruto and One Piece come to mind), suffer from inconsistent quality. A LOT of Shippuden's animation looks cheap and clunky except for big moments. One Piece used to do filler arcs, but then switched to dragging out the episodes as long as possible.

I love the seasonal approach because we get shows with CONSISTENT quality like MHA or Jujutsu Kaisen."

Naruto overwhelms you with fillers but you can’t deny they’re one of the best at character development, by the end of it you know the backgrounds of even the most minor named characters.

Possible-Article-502,nelson64,Also Naruto had 5 seasons of show before Shippuden even started. But I think this right here is the main point to talk about. AoT feels more like it ran for 5 years because of that long break between the first two seasons.

comicsopedia,rivigurl,"I used to as well, but I think it’s too dark for some people just getting in.

comicsopedia,m07815,Yeah tha twa smy first one too. Ifeel like if AOT is your first anime almost all other anime will dissapoint you after
Klutzy_Potato1025,peytonrains,"People always say that, but I can't imagine recommending AOT to someone who's never watched anime. In the first season the characters are absolutely terrible except for mikasa and levi"
peytonrains,Klutzy_Potato1025,but i m the onw who started my anime journey via AOT and also my friend started his via AOT too
comicsopedia,Avalanche687,Breaks > useless filler
Avalanche687,im_fellah,Ur mom > everything

Avalanche687,xElectro17,"I would kill for AoT fillers. I always thought they were dumb, cause they bring nothing new to the story, but in case of AoT I would love to see more episodes of scouts training, main characters chilling and having a good time (for once) or some side characters doing their own business in the city."
xElectro17,JoeyGameLover,"Yeah, this would work really well. AOT has a very character-centric plot, so I believe fillers could work really well to expand the current knowledge we have of pre-existing characters. This would technically be canon, as long as Isayama was on board. I'd love to hear about Levi's S1 squad, since I wasn't really that attached to them. Only Petra was memorable.

I'd love to see that, but it would only really work for S1-S2, and maybe a little bit of 3, but that's only because things get serious after that (not that they weren't before, just more so). Fillers would be kinda out of place.

It'd be nice to have, but I don't think they'd even think of doing it tbh. Maybe if they were classified as OVAs, then maybe.

I'm actually really glad AOT doesn't have fillers, because it's much better to watch, but I just want to know more about the characters we meet."
Avalanche687,SaintAhmad,"Yep. Also, with breaks, the canon content we DO get is usually better directed, has better animation, etc"
Avalanche687,The_Trickster_0,"You still get content instead of nothing in which workers can get more money, I don't understand the logic of hating on fillers."
The_Trickster_0,GJMEGA,Because the content is shit and even when it's not it almost always screws with the canon and pacing somehow. More of something I hate is *not* a good thing in my book.
The_Trickster_0,B_A_Boon,"People hate filler when they're stupid, the final arc of naruto shippuden had waaaaaaaaaay too much filler content, and IIRC it fucked up the pace of the story"
Avalanche687,Bosancer0s,you don't need to watch the fillers lmao. They are there to give more screen time to other characters which aren't essential to the main story.

Kazahaki,DharshanVik,I heard about AoT in 2013 and but I was in middle school and didn’t like anime. I really got into AoT last year after Covid came and screwed my senior year. One of the best things I have ever done. Lowkey sad I read the last chapter tho. AoT’s anime is what made me so interested in the series 😢

slightlycharred7,arielm71,It wasn't at the level of the rest of the series but it wasn't bad... and nothing is worse than the kaguya arc

braujo,DasOddie,It's just a spelling error trust
comicsopedia,alextpotato,We need the most random cross over with the walking dead and attack on titan
comicsopedia,Ahskr_123,"AoT Shippuden: 'Sasha & potato' arc.
Anyways even if it's a filler, I'd have loved to see a little more of child Eren, mikasa, armin friendship moments(i.e. before entry of titan)."
comicsopedia,watersheepjeb_2,10 years for only 75 episodes :(
watersheepjeb_2,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"It's espresso vs americano. You can rewatch all of AOT in a week, if your emotions can take it"
UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,watersheepjeb_2,i finished aot just a week ago in just 3 days
watersheepjeb_2,yvngjiffy703,Quality over quantity
watersheepjeb_2,arielm71,1 chapter of those was better than 75 of Naruto
comicsopedia,DharshanVik,I honestly wish that we got episodes on Attack on Titan: Before the Fall and Attack on Titan Harsh Mistress of the City. There was a 4 year gap between s1 and s2 and those two prequels would have served us nicely.
comicsopedia,ovogoon23,Not sure why everyone is hating on Naruto in here for fillers when aot instead had multiple years of no episodes at all. Both great anime.
comicsopedia,sritejmanda,And 5 of those 11years were fillers
sritejmanda,None,[deleted]
None,sritejmanda,Yeah its better than ruining the anime with pointless fillers
comicsopedia,UnicornJoe42,AoT still running
comicsopedia,Tru_Waifu,yeah but it didnt
comicsopedia,DonataK77,That’s because season 2 took ages to come out
comicsopedia,Novel_Ad_3974,Aot season 1 and 2 have a 4 years break so is more like aot run for 6 years maybe
comicsopedia,Grailstom,"No, but that’s because naruto was continuous while AOT took regular breaks"
comicsopedia,KPL824,After this anime end were all gonna need a attack on titan junior high s2
comicsopedia,None,Oh you're discussing the anime. If you're gonna discuss Naruto you have to include the original.
comicsopedia,JammmJam,"So funny enough I just started watching AOT like 2 weeks ago, I usually hate anime, but I’m also willing to give things chances. I saw the cover art on Hulu for AOT and was like ok that looks different I’ll give it a shot. I’m loving it, I’m like halfway done with season 3.

What other anime’s are similar in feel? More serious feeling and not having a lot of what I would consider over the top anime tropes."
JammmJam,allanecjacks,Toyko ghoul.... should be next on your list.
JammmJam,Sedewt,"• Vinland Saga (animated by Wit Studio, the same ones that animated Attack on Titan)

• Cowboy Bebop 

• Monster

• Great Pretender (another one by Wit)

• Death Note

• Erased

• Tokyo Ghoul*

• Promised Neverland*

*The second seasons are terribly adapted. I suggest switching to the manga when season 1 is over"
JammmJam,ian-codes-stuff,"

There's this other anime about some space cockroaches? It gives off the same vibes as AoT

I'd also suggest checking out Last Exile, FMAB and youjo senki."
comicsopedia,Verratos,Shippuden is a key word here.  Cut out the original series.
comicsopedia,_____wanker_____,"I mean those 11 years of Naruto was actual episodes filler or not, aot did have 4 years of nothing"
comicsopedia,yes-yes-o-my-god,Is the math right idk when they started and I’m too lazy to look it up
yes-yes-o-my-god,YesNoMan58,Yes.
comicsopedia,None,Yes because naruto had 10 million filler episodes.
None,papa_jahn,And that’s only Shippuden
papa_jahn,None,Oh yeah I totally forgot about the 200 episodes of the original series
comicsopedia,MemeForum,"Did you mess up the numbers or something? 2007-2017 - 10 years, 2013-2023 - 9 years"
MemeForum,comicsopedia,Count the first year too
comicsopedia,GermanMarineSS,That’s the difference between 500 episodes and 70
comicsopedia,None,"Shippuden Lost it's charm with the fillers, me who loved naruto as a kid  
came to despise shippuden just because of fillers so much so i didn't saw it till it ended and   
went to youtube just to watch the compilation of last fight, reading whole manga and seeing it ruined in front of me was pain beyond imaginable."
comicsopedia,None,I like AOT more than Naruto.
None,Verratos,"I like candy more than the flu, but why state the obvious?"
Verratos,None,Fuck off.
comicsopedia,righteousforest,"For real though, I love Naruto and it will always hold a special place in my heart, but even setting aside filler AoT tells its story soooo much more efficiently."
comicsopedia,fyrecrotch,"Naruto also had well... Naruto. So that's why it feels long.

I'm not an AoT fan (just like anime) but damn, I remember when this was new lol"
comicsopedia,sw69y,Quality over quantity
comicsopedia,DeRonDarBe,"Naruto trash and AOT good, it’s simple"
DeRonDarBe,Clickbaiting_4_u,"r/iamverysmart

Both are amazing series in their own way"
comicsopedia,J-Roc_vodka,Yeah because 11 is more than 10
comicsopedia,DavidGman,"Wait what. AOT ended in 2021 , and 2007-2017 it’s 10 years , and 2013-2021 is 8 years"
DavidGman,None,[removed]
None,MellowMeah,*Winter 2021
DavidGman,justicefinder,Plus there was a gap between season 1 in 2013 and season 2 in 2017.
comicsopedia,p0ppysmic08,"i cant explain it but mangas with monthly releases somehow tend to have stories that ""seem"" to just fly by, especially when adapted"
comicsopedia,A_Kid_Called_Xander,Probably bc of the gap between the end of season 1 and release of season 2 lol
comicsopedia,LeSp00kMan,It feels different because the original ran for 5 years making the saga feel a lot longer
comicsopedia,Anime_Boi-,Oh how the math is wrong
comicsopedia,Bismuth20,Jojolion has almost been running for 10 years now and that’s just 1 out of the 8 parts
comicsopedia,RaptorRex007,Oh........
comicsopedia,None,Hah! Nope!
comicsopedia,darthcoughcough,Everyone should watch Attack on Titan Junior High. Its a wholesome comedic version of Aot with 12 episodes
comicsopedia,Reckerboii,One peice ran for 15yrs (or longer I dunno )
Reckerboii,braujo,"One Piece has been going for over two decades, both anime and manga. Manga started back in 1997 and the anime's first episode aired in 1999 ~~bizarre summerrrrrr~~"
comicsopedia,superdolmiosauce,"Actually its 13 years, the manga started in 2009 and the anime will end in 2022, so 13 years of attack on titan.

Not even we are safe from the curse of ymir"
comicsopedia,yantimoh,bro..
comicsopedia,None,2013-2021 = 10 years
comicsopedia,a_108_ducks,77 episodes versus 500...
comicsopedia,TheJimDim,"Because Naruto filled in the gaps with fillers, so it felt much longer"
comicsopedia,Predator156,Naruto is like 90% filler......
comicsopedia,user1joja,Yeah AOT doesn’t have filler so there’s the diff
comicsopedia,vortx007,One piece.....
comicsopedia,Environmental-Win836,O.O
comicsopedia,Xianb1,For real? How does Naruto Shippudden produce 500+  episodes and Attack on Titan barely has 50?
Xianb1,braujo,"AoT is a seasonal anime, unlike Naruto. Lately, more and more animes have preferred to go the seasonal route, which was uncommon for shounen a few decades ago. One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, the original runs of DBZ and Saint Seiya are all examples of animes that are/were not seasonal, which means they release new episodes every week unless it's a special holiday or the end of the world. 

AoT, BnH, The Promised Neverland, and others more modern ones are seasonal, so they'll have 12 or 20 episodes seasons and then be done for a while. This helps with pacing, animation, sound design, etc."
comicsopedia,Zacuf93,Does Naruto even have a story? I thought it was just a bunch of filler arcs.
Zacuf93,Shakespeare-Bot,"Doest naruto coequal has't a story? i bethought t wast just a bunch of filler arcs

^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)

Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`"
comicsopedia,IAmBestDuck,"Honestly I would've killed for fillers, or at least more filler OVA's. A lot of my favorite characters are sides that got shafted after S1 or were killed early"
comicsopedia,therealcocoboi,What the actual fuck?
comicsopedia,kirito11400,"I mean Naruto is obv a superior show so ofc it feels different. AOT hits diffs too ofc, not saying it doesn't.

comicsopedia,navit47,...is it just me or is the math like super off
comicsopedia,Electric_Bagpipes,Well shit I feel old.
comicsopedia,-_Juggernaut_-,"Naruto just repeats a bunch of shiz and extends scenes which is like 60% of the episode lol. “How can than that man block my attacks!” 30 min later, “Oh thats How.”"
comicsopedia,UsagiOnii,It’s because Shippuden had 500 episodes that it doesn’t feel the same. They’re not really comparable at all.
comicsopedia,Rang_Dangus,How did it run until 2022. It's over.......
comicsopedia,igxiguaa,Naruto released consistently - it was 16 seasons compared to 4
comicsopedia,TheYoungWolf99,Four of those don’t count.
comicsopedia,dontchewspagetti,"Well this explains everything about the ending then, doesn't it?"
comicsopedia,Toytles,2013-2022 is 9 years tard

comicsopedia,Zeldaforce28,It really doesn't lol.
comicsopedia,FemBodInspector,Quality over quantity
comicsopedia,Riff-Raff767,Weird how naruto felt more like childhood when I kinda started both at the same time
comicsopedia,Sedewt,"It doesn’t feel the same because Attack on Titan is seasonal, while Naruto isn’t"
comicsopedia,nelson64,It doesn't feel the same because Naruto ran for a 5 years before Shippuden too (and had like a million episodes per season hahah)
comicsopedia,PCcezar,One year makes a lot of difference! Especially when you try to het a girl
comicsopedia,None,Honestly would not mind filler episodes in aot. The OVAs were great
comicsopedia,Mai-best,2021*
Mai-best,comicsopedia,You think it's over?

comicsopedia,ASHMIT_r,Lol i started watching last month

Anuj_Purohit,3maiga,cries in I was forced by online spoilers to read the manga and now I already know all the epic things that I wont be able to fully experience when the anime comes out... ;(
3maiga,xShadey,"My friends have spoiled a bit from the manga for me, do you reckon it is worth it to read the manga or just hold out for the anime?"
xShadey,3maiga,"well, if you'd say you have enough discipline to never watch anything aot related on YouTube, Reddit and Instagram again until anime release, then just wait. (the algorithm of these sites likes to spoil) If not, then I'd read it asap if I were you. I started from chapter 1 and I gotta say it's a whole different experience from the anime. The manga continues from where the anime stopped at chapter 115 if you dont wanna read the whole thing."
xShadey,oversized-pepe,is he still your friend ?
xShadey,iHateDem_,I would read it honestly just so you can progress through the story naturally instead of it being spoiled for you.
xShadey,whatyouegg123,"I’d read it just because of the risk of getting it fully spoiled, and the manga is very high quality"
xShadey,Purple_Unicornz,"I would actually start reading the manga on volume 23 which is where season 4 started. Yes, you would just be reading everything you had just watched, but you would understand why we manga readers were upset with each episode. You can see how awesome the fights are and how badly adapted Mappa put it together. I can't believe how laughably bad one of the most hype moments in season 4 was ruined and we can never see it done well again. I'm talking about the warhammer fight. And knowing what's coming next in the final fight, I can guarantee 100% that absolutely everything will be CGI. It would be impossible to even make the humans look 2D. It's like the show would transition to an entirely CGI anime like Black Rock Shooter for example."
3maiga,lablackey27,desperately trying to resist reading the Manga so I won't accidentally spoil things for others.

Anuj_Purohit,FaithlessnessFar2793,Hope there will be less use of cgi in this season

Unknown_Human12,WeBacklnblack,"A very fine work of art that contrast such powerful emotion from Mikasa. Giving a deadly look in her eyes and Bertolt, Having an emotionless expression.

stupidcats2301,mita_amrita,REAL shower thoughts here lol. Maybe the titan form would still be female while the titan holder remained male in human form?
mita_amrita,yaserafriend,Maybe the male human will not be able to make use the full powers of the female titans just as a non-royal cannot take full advantage of the founding titan.
yaserafriend,None,[deleted]
yaserafriend,JaimeL_,What if they started identifying as female?
mita_amrita,Liam_02,"I don't think so, just like the warhammer and cart titans are ""male"" titans controlled by female shifters, following that logic the female titan could be controlled by either gender"
Liam_02,mita_amrita,"Hmm, that's true with the founder >!having had both male and female carriers!<. (season 2 I think)"
mita_amrita,bokbokboi,"I think the female titan just needs to be fast and agile, and that the feminine traits are just appearance. If a male warrior took the female titan, it would appear male, but would have the same abilities."
bokbokboi,None,[removed]
mita_amrita,eteague30,Maybe they have the same powers as the female titan but they have a male form
eteague30,None,What powers does the female titan possess by itself. Seems like it was more of a direct opposite to Erin's titan than an actual titan. Or was that the point of it ? A defense titan perhaps?
stupidcats2301,raptorjesus001,The Warhammer and cart titan have a male appearance while the user is female so it isn't that far of a stretch to say that the female titan is unique in the fact that it has feminine features regardless of the user's gender
raptorjesus001,chrismatt213,Isn’t the war hammer titan that egg/seed thing and the holder creates whatever they want? So the holder could create the war hammer to be male or female.
chrismatt213,None,"That does make sense considering Tybur family wanted the holder of the titan to be a secret. (I think, I'm not completely sure) If they all made their Titans look the same, you wouldn't be able to tell who has it."
raptorjesus001,jarhead839,Except we see Freya have a female appearance when she’s the founding titan when Grisha steals it.
jarhead839,DOOMFOOL,That makes sense considering the nature of the founding though. It definitely could just be a unique thing for it specifically that it’s form matches the gender of its shifter.
jarhead839,Pap4MnkyB4by,"We also have to remember that the Founding Titan is special, and we have seen a few variants for it's appearance. Since the holder of the power is revered as a god, perhaps we can assume that the power doesn't have to follow the rules other shifters do"
jarhead839,_Beningt0n_,"I mean we have never seen Eren or Grisha as the founding titan, maybe they secretly have breasts?"
jarhead839,nasgorhead,you mean Frieda? Freya is Grisha's dead sister
raptorjesus001,SidTheSloth97,This only makes it more confusing though.
raptorjesus001,None,Femboy Titan then.
raptorjesus001,i_am_da_1_who_knocks,The person would become fat cause man boobs
raptorjesus001,ibettercomeon,"The warhammwr titan seemed female enough to me. It had a waist, skinny, a female booty and the voice."
ibettercomeon,raptorjesus001,Bruh that can apply to anyone
ibettercomeon,Bombkirby,It looked very gender neutral IMO. The face/lips were drawn a bit between masculine/feminine. I feel like that's the point of titans anyways since they have no need for reproductive organs/gender/a sex/etc. They're just vehicles.
raptorjesus001,Ders2001,the cart titan is feminine as fuck what are you talking about?
Ders2001,KingFredo5674,"Bruh it has short hair and no tiddies, it is a male titan. Female titan has tiddies."
Ders2001,DOOMFOOL,Not really. Most people I talked to who watched season 3 thought that Titan was definitely a male shifter
Ders2001,raptorjesus001,Cart titan looks like a 40 year old man going through a midlife crisis
stupidcats2301,None,"Nothing , he'll just have a Titan form that'll will have boobs and a female body structure. It's original Japanese term  女型の巨人  actually means *female type* Titan not just ""female Titan"" because a Titan doesn't have genitals so it has no biological sex."
None,WyrmWood815,"Yo I have tits and I’m a guy, do I qualify as a female type?"

stupidcats2301,fuckyoufam_69,"Shouldn't the ""timer"" of 13 years reset when they obtain a new titan? Or maybe half? Like: 

1 titan = 13 years 

2 titans = 6.5 years

And so on.... 

>!Why can't the founding titan ""change"" bodies of ""people of Ymir"" to get rid of ymir curse,  like they did during that epidemic that one time? !< 

Just some random thoughts... 

Also, >! how come eren had dreams about future (those realistic dreams) **before** becoming a titan? (Remember that scene where him and mikasa r picking up firewood and he wakes up crying) !<"
fuckyoufam_69,Bluu_Ash,>!Im gonna assume since Erens future was already determined (since he’s the Attack Titan) he was already able to see into the paths?  I’m not 100% sure but that’s what it seems like to me!<

cjs2k_032,None,Yeah
cjs2k_032,Visibeaver,Yeah it’s one of the main leaks from chapter 139 being thrown around
cjs2k_032,chandranshu_7,"He said
Plot twist: The female titan turns the shifter into a female if the holder is a male

one way to transition, i guess....
This"
cjs2k_032,sassysassysalad,"Don’t believe your friend, it’s true"
stupidcats2301,None,"No idea but from what I can tell, the Founding Titan has both masculine and feminine forms, depending on the wielder. My guess is that the Female Titan is connected to Ymir more closely than the others, hence its appearance."
None,DOOMFOOL,Why would the Female be more closely connected to Ymir than the Founding? I feel that the opposite is true
DOOMFOOL,None,"The Founding is directly connected, sure. I'm talking about the other shifters. Like, when I think Founding Titan, I think Ymir, so there's no need to explicate their relation. Besides, I never outright said ""more than the Founding"". I said more than the others, and you could have extrapolated, or I could have been clearer."
stupidcats2301,Pap4MnkyB4by,"Then his Titan would be the female Titan with a masculine face possibly. Think of the Titans as squishy Mech suits. Just because the shifter is one gender doesn't mean that he has to match the apparent gender of the Titan, my friend"
stupidcats2301,Churriflow,"Maybe the power of the female titan is tu run and has a lot of endurance, but is called the female titan because is the only Titan that looks female. [Here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) you can find the whole theory"
Churriflow,MaNameSWISH,Wasnt her power to harden her skin and the scream that attracts titans?
MaNameSWISH,DopeEspeon,Hardening is something all the shifters drank reiners fluid to be able to do.
Churriflow,None,"That's what I believe. Annie's Titan looks just like her. I spoiled that she was the Female Titan, but it didn't feel weird because it seems sort of obvious. I'd imagine her specific power is attracting pure titans. It's like an animal's mating call."
Churriflow,I-eat-foot,Thank god I use the in app browser and not the actual browser
Churriflow,adapavii,>!Did you just ?!<
adapavii,Environmental-Win836,>!I was going to ask why this was spoiler marked but I assume it’s marked so you don’t ruin the prank...!<
Churriflow,None,😑
stupidcats2301,Lightbringer34,"I think it would be interesting if the Female Titan was the only one that had a gender-locked requirement, as a way to differentiate her and since she took on the founder Ymir’s personality that was explicitly female. If a man has the titan power, it just won’t work. Thus, why she’s called the female titan. No need to overcomplicate things."
stupidcats2301,None,"I’m pretty sure I read somewhere that the real name of the female Titian is the marital arts titan, which makes sense given its agility and concentrated hardening to add punch to kicks and punches. It just is called the female titan by those in Paridis because that’s it’s defining characteristic. I think later they just keep calling it the female titan in the anime because that makes the most sense to viewers. So yeah, I a guy got it, it would just be a guy titan. I think at least."
None,Piorn,"Not to mention the nose and blonde hair definitely link it to the user, so it's not a stretch to assume the rest of the appearance is derived from that too."
stupidcats2301,Biscuute,What if MIKASA inherited the female Titan....
Biscuute,None,Actually >!she can't because she's an Ackerman!<.
None,Biscuute,Ah! You’re right. Well then—let Hange be the female Titan.
None,Environmental-Win836,>!The Ackermans can’t inherit titans? Has that been revealed yet?!<
None,joseloc0,So Levi cannot eat Zeke ? Or what if Levi drinked that wine of Zeke’s?
None,Kapuccino,Actually she can because she's also an Eldian.
Biscuute,DarccDracconicc,Then eren would barn seggs with mikasa

stupidcats2301,blobBob99,trans titan
stupidcats2301,None,Futa cock
stupidcats2301,fhmn_2,Like piek she's female but the titan is male so if a male inherit female titan the titan would be FEMALE
fhmn_2,swans183,You were so close
fhmn_2,None,"Other way around, dumbarse"
None,fhmn_2,Could you elaborate
stupidcats2301,DarkWhite19,"Maybe, just another Eldian baby gets it directly. It is the FEMALE titan. It'd be like Ackermans. No effect whatsoever."
stupidcats2301,devilthedankdawg,Turns into a... Elton John Titan
stupidcats2301,Aschentei,Thanks can’t sleep now
stupidcats2301,Why_Is_Gamora_,Considering the most thing that stood out about the titan form to name it is that it looks female then I guess even male shifters would still look like a female titan. If that wasn't the case then it would have been named after it's abilities like mimic titan or something.

stupidcats2301,None,"It’s power has nothing to do with being female, if a male inherited it they would have a pre-determined male titan body. No trap titan or anything like that."
None,raptorjesus001,"Then why's it called the female titan? Every other titan shifter we've seen has a male appearance, even if the user is female (except Frieda Reiss but that's a separate theory about the founding titan) so I think that the female titan is unique in the fact that it has a female appearance, regardless of the user's gender"
raptorjesus001,None,"Ahh, the answer is..... nobody knows, It was originally called that by the scouts because it looked like a female titan, there really wasn’t anything else, and it was the last revealed titan power so they just went: “fuck why not just call it that”"

Annual-Temperature-2,WyrmWood815,"No, annie’s titan has a lot of little abilities from other titan shifters (hardening, turning into a crystal, commanding titans in a short range, etc).

Plus, the attack titan has one major ability that’s only been hinted at in the anime so far, and the female titan definitely doesn’t have it."
WyrmWood815,Ders2001,">!are you talking about the power to see future weilder's memories or when he got all charred and hot while fighting annie or that he can transform a bunch of times and regenerate really fast? I figured that the last three were because he had the founder which is ""superior in every way""!<"
WyrmWood815,Annual-Temperature-2,"In that case even a male would turn into the female titan, since pieck a female still turns into a male titan."
WyrmWood815,DarccDracconicc,They should probably call it the mimic Titan instead of female titan
WyrmWood815,Kermit_Memelord,"So wtf is the attack titans ability? Sicko mode? Cus apperantly it's an anime only form

(note: I am not asking for spoilers just theories/guesses)"
stupidcats2301,No-Soap,*MAN TITTIES AND FUTA COCK*
stupidcats2301,None,[deleted]
None,DOOMFOOL,Except as we explicitly know in the show literally anyone can inherit the Founding. Royal blood is simply the requisite to make full use of its power
stupidcats2301,None,Bruh
stupidcats2301,None,"I always thought that was impossible. If a man ate Annie, the power would just go to a random Eldian girl."
stupidcats2301,None,He becomes a Femboy Titan
stupidcats2301,None,"Femboy Titan, we can end the argument now."
stupidcats2301,EgocentricRaptor,Trans titan?
stupidcats2301,stonkmastr347,They would unlock the sexy Jutsu from naruto
stupidcats2301,fuckenshreddit,[Nice](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
stupidcats2301,wing3d,The trans titan.
stupidcats2301,OmOshIroIdEs,r/reversezooked
stupidcats2301,InternationalPanda22,they get tiddies
stupidcats2301,None,Maybe they die?
stupidcats2301,NismahBTW,IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT ABOUT THATTTTT
stupidcats2301,_hf14,You get the femboy titan
stupidcats2301,TheRedMarioBrother,"The real question is what form is default form when transforming if you already have 2+ Titan powers? Like if someone had the cart Titan but also swallowed the colossal Titan host or if the jaw Titan host swallowed the war hammer Titan host?

I’d be scared dead if I saw the colossal Titan move with the form and speed of the cart Titan."
TheRedMarioBrother,Franzz97,"Well I think one can choose whatever titan form he's gonna get based on the situation but he can also use other powers in some ways. Imagine a cart titan that can produce steam from his muscles and a big explosion whenever he transforms or a colossal with an improved endurance in combat. Or a jaw titan with the ability to create weapons and pillars or a warhammer with stronger jaws and claws.

I don't know think agility is part of the jaw titan power, it's just something that comes with its small body and athletic build"
stupidcats2301,LittleCoaks,"I mean, it’s not like there’s some official name for the titans. Those are just the names people call them based on their appearances. Maybe the “howling titan” is more fitting cause of it’s screaming power? The female appearance could just be a byproduct of the holder, kinda like Freida Reiss’ founding titan"
stupidcats2301,Killer_Queen696969,Just a theory but a guy can inherit the female titan but he can't use it
stupidcats2301,BxLorien,"They really should've just named Annie's titan the ""Skinless Titan"". It would have been so much more appropriate. The ""Female Titan"" title from season one could easily have been attributed to none of the main characters knowing it's proper title."
stupidcats2301,GraphicsProgrammer,"All titans except the female titan are masculine, even with women being the progenitor, so a man being the female titan would still have a female titan form"
stupidcats2301,crucifix1711,futa titan
stupidcats2301,idiotguy467,Minorish manga spoilers: >!we see this in a shot of previous titan shifters it is a very weird looking male body with breasts (the head looks slightly deformed but this may be because it is a pretty low detail image!<
stupidcats2301,Environmental-Win836,That was exactly my thought.
stupidcats2301,Gratick1,Well the armored titan isn't the only one with hardening and the beast titan is not inherited by beasts. Those are just names the humans gave the titans. The titans don't really follow strict class rules like a rpg would have. When you look at the skill set the female and attack titan are not really that different. I think the female titan is not gender specific but someone named it like that because it was used by a woman.
stupidcats2301,Risdio51,"Simple, man titties happen."
stupidcats2301,John628_29,It would be very male to start playing with your boobs in this situation
stupidcats2301,None,They'd be a female titan
stupidcats2301,septice013,Idk if this was true but there was another conversation about this and someone said the translation is actually supposed to be martial arts titan or something but it’s similar to female in Japanese. But again I’m not sure I didn’t do any research.
stupidcats2301,None,OH THANK YOU!! Finally someone saying it!
stupidcats2301,jojo2005146,Futa titan.
stupidcats2301,chipthehippie,"It's either one of three things:

Either it's called the Female Titan because, throughout history, Eldians learned that only females can successfully inherit it

Or

Because it simply looks like a female 

Or

Because, like the Attack Titan being destined to go to someone who fights for freedom, the Female Titan may just be destined to go to a female each time."
stupidcats2301,vexex73,that is a question that will keep you up at night
stupidcats2301,Hey__Martin,Then it would be the transgender titan
stupidcats2301,UnoriginalNaem,They get gynecomastia just like me
stupidcats2301,None,If a male inherits the female titan they become a futa
stupidcats2301,zedobigode18,Why didn't the first titan that ate eren in season 1 inherit eren's titan?
zedobigode18,Cocoacanon,"(I'm not 100% if this is what was stated) But since that titan swallowed him (mostly) whole, his spinal fluid wasn't released and the titan didn't transfer. Moreover, Eren was still alive in the titan's stomach."
Cocoacanon,zedobigode18,"Oh I get it now. But did he schew the war hammer titan or only swallowed it? From my point of view, he only swallowed it, so that means that the war hammer titan is alive or no?"
stupidcats2301,Dsb0208,"Look at the cart Titan, we can assume it’s closer to a “male Titan” but it’s used by a chick, and it looks ugly as fuck. 

The female Titan, if used by a dude would probably be functional, but maybe a little physically deformed, especially around the face and chest, where it’s “female aspects” are"
stupidcats2301,greatvaluebrandman,"My guess is the titan would appear more androgynous, but I suppose it all really comes down to the actual user's appearance at the end of the day"
stupidcats2301,sleuth0,How is this not a spoiler?
stupidcats2301,SngleAndReadyToMngle,The transgender Titan 0_0
stupidcats2301,Realitys-cards,Its the gay titan
stupidcats2301,Mike_Wazowski_69420,Gender neutral female Titan?
stupidcats2301,None,"Yes, they could. They would just have tits on their titan."
stupidcats2301,Ketsuraki,"Maybe that straightup cant happen.
It could be that the male person who gets turned to a titan and eats the previous owner of the female titan just dies and a random eldian child born at that time inherits the female titan."
stupidcats2301,ZiadHendy_,The Trap Titan
stupidcats2301,SWAT-101,"I think it simply won't manifest  when the user is male, instead the titan will look like a pure titan or the attack titan. It also may have no skin just like the female titan."
stupidcats2301,GrubSlayer,"Nothing will happen of the sort ya crazies.

You'll get the powers of said titan and nothing more. In fact, the only unique thing about Annie's titan is her screech and her natural hardening. So it would be more apt to call her the Banshee Titan or something of the sort. Though she's likely called the Female Titan because they need to easily distinguish between the various shifters.

Referring to her titan by it's abilities would be difficult due to her titan not having a really distinct appearance based off her abilities. Like the Colossal is big, the Armored is..yknow, the Attack is super basic looking and fast, the Warhammer has its weird armor, and the Beast looks like an animal of some kind. Annie's titan doesn't have some incredibly distinct appearance like everybody else does."
stupidcats2301,beardstachioso,Then it becomes a Transtitan.
stupidcats2301,peekochoo2,femboy titan?
stupidcats2301,DrPikachu-PhD,The Trans Titan
stupidcats2301,None,"What if it's not possible?

Maybe when a male titan eats the female titan - the female titan holder just dies and no power is transferred.

Maybe it'll then go to the next born female Eldian."
stupidcats2301,ARshutup,Yoo😳🤯
stupidcats2301,WookieBaconBurger,I asked this not too long ago and the general consensus was that he would get man titties
stupidcats2301,louweezerz,"I still don’t get WHY a female titan when the attack titan already has the same powers 😐
but i do love Annie’s Female titan design ngl"
stupidcats2301,yaboidank2,"Do be like that, it do be like that."
stupidcats2301,RicardoArpan69,Remember the time eren was about chew down annie and Levi pulled him out
stupidcats2301,BothDistrict8234,"So apparently, the male still possess a female body......well boys if there is a hole there is a way"
stupidcats2301,Cabobsin,Well the whole thing is that the female titan is practically the attack titan but faster. Maybe the only reason it's called female titan is cuz it's always been passed to a female. Otherwise it's be called the agility titan
stupidcats2301,Speeeedwag0n,A question yet to be answered
stupidcats2301,LemonadeOnIce,Bing bong ur dick is **gone**
stupidcats2301,Fredo365,Wouldn’t it be like how if a normal person got the founding Titan they have it but can’t use it because they don’t have royal blood so you can have the female Titan but can’t use it if your male or that’s what I think
stupidcats2301,Fun_Christian_Pranks,The transgender titan
stupidcats2301,poopi593,"""I DON'T NEED SLEEP I NEED ANSWERS!"""
stupidcats2301,folgore248,It'd probably look like an attack titan without skin.
stupidcats2301,TheRealDoikid,Trans Titan
stupidcats2301,No_Spread1841,"Bit late to this, I know, but I think that the Titan is in reality not a female titan no, I think it's more like a muscular, strong, fighting Titan"

None,ForsythePhD,Whose memories are these
None,Main-Double,God that feels like a lifetime ago omg
None,enginyear,It almost feels like that the anime has changed its genre since then.I used like that dystopian setting a lot where humanity has to fight for survival.Now it's a political clusturfuck.I still like it tho.But eren's actions now are making me doubt which side i should root for.
enginyear,lialali,"the point is that there is no ""good"" or ""bad"" side so it makes sense to be confused"
enginyear,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"Yes, very much so.

Honestly it's not like this started in season 4 either. The uprising arc has freedom of the press as a major plot element!"
enginyear,ShaidarHaran2,"There's like 3 hard pivots in your understanding of what's going on in the world in a show, it's pretty amazing how well done it was, starting out as ignorant as the characters in the show about the outside world. From the can of herring and coffee and thinking maybe there were groups in the forest to ""wait, there's more advanced civilization outside the walls?"". And then understanding Eldia and Marley and how the titans were getting there. I assume yet another pivot in understanding is coming.

I remember all those Sascha potato memes about how it wasn't actually half, and Levi pose meme when he kicked Eren in the court room, that also birthed to the levi x eren lol. It was pretty much the hype. Especially with the Female Titan Arc. No skipping of openings 1 and 2, it was the national anthem. What a fucking ride this is, my childhood.

Too bad tho, it took years for the second season to drop."

timmytibs28,ThisisLarn,"Pretty sure it's Reiner, he's got the >!honorary Marleyan armband (red). Falco wouldn't have that because he's still a candidate.  Unless its foreshadowing/purposefully supposed to be unclear.!<"

nan,H_yrule,"EIGHT YEARS ALREADY?????

nan,willemklomp,damn i just watched that for the first time
willemklomp,None,Careful for spoilers on here
nan,None,"The manga started in 2009, and the anime ends in 2022! The curse of Ymir ."
nan,ricky2234,"Damn, I remember being a freshman in high school and picking up the manga after S1 ended. It was in the beginning of the Uprising arc, crazy to see how fast time has gone and where the story is now. Thank you Isayama :,)"
nan,DeadZeus007,"When episode 1 aired, how far along was the Manga?"
DeadZeus007,IronVeil,"I don't think that far, maybe like halfway through the female titan part?"
DeadZeus007,MegaPlaysGames,"Chapter 44 was just about to come out, which is around Episode 7 of season 2. Season 1 ended at chapter 34, which is why there was such a long gap for season 2."

nan,Front_Explanation628,thankful asf for the guy under a mha video who told me to watch SnK like 6 months ago🙏🏽
nan,SlapItOnYourMouth,"I remember watching this show back in 2013 when there was only 3 episodes, and hunter x hunter was almost wrapping up. It was an awesome transition because I could hardly find animes like hxh. I wish I could watch all of the seasons back to back but I had to wait 8 years for the final season. AND ITS NOT EVEN DONE YET LOL"
nan,Lieutenant_Squidz,"Oh man. I’ll never forget randomly turning on Toonami, with absolutely no idea it was the dub premiere, and being greeted with giant naked people eating humans. I kept saying “What the fuck is this?!”, but I knew I was sucked in. What a ride. Been reading the manga for years now."
nan,dollpet,"Jesus I was 13 years old just about to go into high school, now I’m almost finished university 😭
Can’t believe I’ve been following since the beginning"
nan,princetheezy,"“This trip was truly fun, wasn’t it?”"
nan,None,"Its crazy to think back to when I first watched it. Always wondering what the outside world was like, whether they really were the only civilization left on earth, if titans roamed the entire planet. Not only was it the complete opposite of that, but this entire story became so much deeper than I ever would have imagined."
nan,scaryygold,Omg~ I’ve been a fan of this show since it came out and now it’s over. I’m feelin some type of way
nan,None,I can't imagine the media landscape without AOT. It's been there so long & I love it

nan,kek_Pyro,2 days... 😭😭😭
nan,DanielRobenson,"Damn I remember I used to have this poster in my room years ago.

Happy anniversary to you all, hope you enjoyed the ride so far."
nan,Esterosa69,And here’s to the next 8 years or so it will feel until the series finale

nan,None,"Damn, I feel old"
nan,imakewaffles,Pfft
nan,Hello-there-yes-you,It’s crazy that I was 9 when I saw snippets of this show on adult swim
nan,Thicka_snicka88,"I remember trying to get everyone to watch AoT 8 yrs ago.... like ""look! They're eating people, OMIGODDDDD!!!""

Most of my friends thought I was crazy. Then season 2 took so long that I forgot about it. Caught up by fall of 2020. Read the manga and caught up this month. 

The maturity of the characters can't be beat- it's something I have never seen in other manga/anime series, not to this degree.

I couldnt stand Eren for at LEAST 2 seasons, but by the beginning of season 4....well, that's changed.

1...more...day!!!!"
nan,alonekratos,"Tbh.. i hoped that one day i will tell young ones to read this fkn great manga.. i hoped that i could tell then that i waited for days, months and years for the story to be completed.. and here i am, right now.👾 regretting reading the last chapter.. ⚠️ FUCK YOU ISAYAMA😑✋🏻"
nan,Erwin_Smith483,Holy shit
nan,seviothelegenda,"And 10 years later, the final, 100th episode will air. Pathetic pacing"
nan,Yukidoke,It's been an awesome 8 years. Each season of this masterpiece was worthy of watching. And it’s great that there will be the second part of the final season in the next year as well.
nan,jlorenzo494,Wow 8 years is crazy.. I remember seeing my cousin watching it when it was first released (doesnt feel like that long ago). I thought giant humanoid creatures eating humans was a bit weird and dumb. Little did i know it would become so much more than that. The plot and storytelling is perhaps the best I’ve ever seen for any show/ series/ anime. Happy birthday Snk / AOT !
nan,ScorpioLaw, I feel bad for everyone who loved it then. I was lucky enough to enjoy it
nan,None,Hate myself for not watching it when it came out
nan,Archlegendary,wait this show started on my birthday holy shit

nan,shadingwolf,"I thought this was an April fools joke, that's amazing! I started and finished AOT this month after thinking it was an overhyped and not my type of anime for the LONGEST time. Now the story has my damn heart :(("
nan,None,It's been a hell of a ride. I'm glad I was part of this journey.

nan,None,Man I cant believe how old this show is. I have a weird ass history with it. I was in middle school when the first season came out and I remember everybody wearing the jackets and stuff thinking they were weirdos. Then I got into anime around 2015 and I watched the first season that summer and fucking loved it. They took way too long with the second season and I lost interest. The past two years I’ve been struggling to get back into it until recently and now im halfway through 4
nan,shane727,Damn it's been a while. I just remember seeing people using the show for a bunch of dumb memes on reddit as a template and thinking it looked kinda cool. Been following it ever since....

unrelatedtoelephant,namonade,Same length but i feel like the hype part comes sooner than the others (except red swan since it's different type of song)
Possible_Mind3663,StrayGod360,My head automatically starts to nod listening to this opening.
JesseKam,EddyJager,"Ah, i see the history of Titanfolk is well documented."
EddyJager,StrayGod360,Mods should pin this at the top.

EddyJager,MoonTrooper258,"Ever since the Battle Of Demeter, IMC reinforcements have been cut-off from the Core Systems. ... That was about 30 years ago in the timeline, so I suspect that they’ll find a new method of getting people to the Frontier soon. The war ended in a stalemate, but who knows what’ll happen once Phaserunner tech becomes more prominent. I believe that the Fold Weapon was actually an accidental byproduct of testing Phasegate technology, as we also see an Arc on Olympus. I just hope Fukuda hasn’t forgotten about the whole Remnant Fleet arc from the first game....

... Wait, wrong TF."

Kerim44,butterednoodles27,There has to be something to overtake the shit Annie meme
butterednoodles27,RekklesCami,I know right. Still wondering how that low effort Annie post got top of all time
butterednoodles27,Colonel_Grande_,Wait what the hell. I just realized that Annie meme is the most upvoted post from this subreddit. Seriously? The best this sub has to offer is a shitty Eren good Alliance bad meme?
butterednoodles27,R3pN1xC,"God the fact that meme is the top of all time is embarrassing, there has been so much good content over the years, the love doctor, the fanarts by u/YumiruOurSaviour, the abridged series, chapter in a nutshell, every character's facebook, the ancient titans fan-arts, the naenae fan-arts and so much more I forgot. There is so much good shit that is worthy for top of all time but it has to be that fucking shitty Annie meme.

Thanks for listening my ted talk.

JesseKam,Kuraimoridraw,Someone please explain AnR. Btw I love this
Kuraimoridraw,None,"Akatsuki no requiem. The basics is that eren is forced to kill his friends, and is forced to live with the guilt for the rest of his life, and also ymir reincarnates into historia's child. I dont have any posts saved detailing anything else, but there have been literal pages of content that people have thought up about this theory.


It all stems from the suspicious imagery of this music video: https://youtu.be/PbV3Yr3KCyg"
None,Kuraimoridraw,Thanks!
Kuraimoridraw,dedezin404,It's the akatsuki no requiem theory. It's based on the official video of season 3 part 1 ending.
dedezin404,QuarantineSucksALot,Hitman working part time as a photographer.
Kuraimoridraw,ron_weedsley,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0zZArUV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0zZArUV8)

If I'm correct, there's a theory based on this clip which was originally released in 2018(?). Surprisingly enough, two years later a lot of the things in the video match up with what's going on. So now a lot of people assume it will end the same way as shown here, with Eren killing everyone outside of Paradis including the alliance, he gets to live and have a family with Historia however he'll be sad and mourn his friends for the rest of his life."
Kuraimoridraw,YonatanShofty,Yeah what is anr?

JesseKam,xevoz21,What is AnR?
xevoz21,H-K_47,"""AnR"" stands for ""Akatsuki no Requiem"". Basically it's a theory where Eren wins but his friends die, so he has to live the rest of his life with the guilt of what he has done. The name comes from [Akatsuki no Requiem official music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0zZArUV8) (the S3P1 ending theme song) which seems to depict it perfectly. It's a popular theory here and some people really want it to come true."

The name comes from [Akatsuki no Requiem official music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0zZArUV8) (the S3P1 ending theme song) which seems to depict it perfectly. It's a popular theory here and some people really want it to come true."

JesseKam,Ben99ny22,whats AnR?
Ben99ny22,H-K_47,"""AnR"" stands for ""Akatsuki no Requiem"". Basically it's a theory where Eren wins but his friends die, so he has to live the rest of his life with the guilt of what he has done. The name comes from [Akatsuki no Requiem official music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ0zZArUV8) (the S3P1 ending theme song) which seems to depict it perfectly. It's a popular theory here and some people really want it to come true."
H-K_47,Ben99ny22,is there a post to explain the theory? I wanna read up on it.
JesseKam,Ruiner_Zero,What a goddamn masterpiece. If AOT really ends like Naruto then at least we have this video to look at and laugh.

RiYaZeD,MrBungala,This scene looks like exactly from the trailer 😍

carsonator40,Interesting_Force_51,Didn’t had a problem Ost’s were playing everytime it wasn’t silent what were you watching on bro.
Interesting_Force_51,carsonator40,I could be completely wrong I’m not sure. All of a sudden I just completely stopped enjoying all my favorite anime from naruto to one piece to attack on titan I don’t seem to enjoy any new content for some reason idk what’s wrong with me

Is it normal to name your child after anime characters? 

Coz otherwise Maria rose and Sina are pretty good names. I've never heard Sina before tho."
usayd2009,Droyst-hoist,Sina is the name of my cousin. But that was way before aot.

usayd2009,TBritnell,My niece has the middle name of Yunalesca.  Might sound cute until you find out the father had a crush on the character when he was growing up.
TBritnell,usayd2009,I'm assuming it'd be pretty common these days considering how obsessed people on the Internet get over stupid fictional characters.
usayd2009,chaderenabs,"I've met a boy who's name is goku, armin's also a pretty common name besides eren in Germany"

Naming your children after a GoT character or a fictional character with an unusual name is somewhat selfish and irresponsible on the parents' part."

Maypher,Supernova-581,"It first split into 3(3 powers for each daughter) and then split into 3 more. And yes, they were fritz’s daughters. What exactly do you find confusing?"
Supernova-581,Maypher,I just find it weird that Isayama decided to name Fritz's daughters exactly the same as Karl's...
Maypher,Lostcentaur,"The 3 daughters each had 3 children that each ate there mothers spine. Which made the 9 other titans. And the children after that that tried to there mother’s spine into pure titans

He has given us laughter and dissapointment . He has been one of the most entertaining characters making us laugh at our lows during the leaks , annoy others during our highs , get multiple versions of himself to look forward towards it , and became a staple of sub . 

He will be laid to rest among the greatest memes of this sub after the ever approaching leaks thread where he will reach his peak and then fade . He may be resurrected for epsiode discussions , for few memes , but it will not be anything like it was at his peak .

We are all blessed for witnessing and experiencing this great meme , the great character behind the meme , the great story from which this character originates from . This story made me feel emotional for memes , shall forever be etched in my mind whether I want to forget it or not . 

Salute you Zook ."

DrDoctah,DrDoctah,"Honestly if the positions were swapped, Eren would have been the perfect kid to use for the restorationists. He's already so angry, they can just direct his anger towards Marley."
DrDoctah,DaddyLevesque,"Marley was about to catch them before Zeke snitched, Eren would have beem lined up at the port with the rest of the restorationists that the main difference."
DaddyLevesque,DrDoctah,Eren inadvertently exposes the restorationists because he can't stop screaming about the restoration of the Eldian Empire at the top of his lungs to every Marleyan scum he sees.
DaddyLevesque,None,"Implied but not confirmed. I think it's likely but ""we have some leads already"" could mean anything."
DrDoctah,Jackrrr10000,Carla genes give him the sass and the angery
DrDoctah,seninn,"I am not one for AU stuff, but I would like to see how the story would have turned out if the kids were swapped."
DrDoctah,None,Eren would’ve sent them to Paradis at age 4 before even Eldian Restoration begins
DrDoctah,None,And even without his Titan abilities he was at (close to) the top of his class as a soldier. He was exactly what Grisha wanted Zeke to be.
None,glutenfreewhitebread,"He had titan abilities during training though, he just didn't know it

They were at least in partial use too, there's that Easter egg where his head is steaming after injuring it"
None,mercurylovesvenus,Funny how he was at the top 10 of his class and still ended up getting ‘killed’ during the first major crisis 😭
None,GibbyGG1,He had Titan abilities by then just dormant. He did kill 2 adult males at the age of 9.
DrDoctah,BananaBladeOfDoom,"This depends on how soon they were swapped.

At birth? Eren would end up feeling indoctrinated while Zeke would get angry watching his mom get eaten.

Just far enough for Eren to hate the titans? Assuming they managed to swap places without Eren realizing he was already in Marley, perhaps he would become a useful soldier to Marley like he was to the Survey Corps."
DrDoctah,GreenLama4,Is that not exactly whats happening?
DrDoctah,salamader_crusader,We already have Marleyan Eren.  Gabi Gang 😎
DrDoctah,berthototototo,Hence Gabi.

DrDoctah,DrDoctah,When you try to give your second son a better childhood and he somehow turns out WORSE
DrDoctah,Onion-with-layers,"Reject nihilism, return to METAL genocide"
Onion-with-layers,None,[deleted]
Onion-with-layers,pastgoneby,I fully unironically agree with that. Paradis and the subjects of ymirr have more power. If some group must be exterminated who would in their right mind capitulate and let themselves be exterminated. Best being exterminator than exterminated. Eren attempted to do what was necessary to ensure the survival of his people. The intervention of everyone else is sad because they simply can't see the gravity of their position. By doing anything short of exterminating all other nations they are only delaying their inevitable end. I hope in the last chapter Eren manages to do something. Plus regardless of whether he actually dies or not whoever inherits his Titans be it a potential child of his or some rando they'll inherit his will and lead to a poggers solution for the people of Paradis.
DrDoctah,Lightbringer34,"Grisha must’ve drank himself under the table when Eren saved Mikasa by stabbing a bunch of people and showing no remorse. For the first time, he could see how his son would become something Great and Terrible."
Lightbringer34,None,[deleted]
DrDoctah,Fomentatore,He litterally fed himself to Eren just after his ex ate his mom. I wouldn't call it a better childhood.
Fomentatore,DrDoctah,Remember that happened after Eren broke into a house and slaughtered 3 dudes and showed no remorse towards it. Grisha noted that Eren was always furious as a child and that was before any attack titan fuckery.
DrDoctah,Rintohsakabooty,adult eren said that young eren was born like this. I wonder it was the result of looping
DrDoctah,AsurasPath23,"His first son wanted to literally take the dicks out of every Eldian and the other one wanted to save them. So practically, Eren was for saving his people, but his friends cared less for that."
AsurasPath23,DrDoctah,"Fair point, but I'm comparing the two as kids. 

Zeke- wants to read fairy tales with his grandparents and play catch with Ksaver.

Eren- doesn't have friends because he's a raging shithead and committed manslaughter way before he enlisted in the military."
AsurasPath23,ultimateweebalt123,"Eren also committed global genocide. If it’s between “taking the dicks out of a relatively small group of people” and “violently crushing everyone except for a small group of people”, the former is probably better, even if both are bad. And Eren wasn’t really saving the Eldians, he was saving the *Walldians*, he still killed a large part of the Eldian population."
AsurasPath23,conopidaucigasa,"> His first son wanted to literally take the dicks out of every Eldian

That's a Titanfolk meme. He just wanted to make them sterile."
DrDoctah,Bloano,"When love = damming your son to a fate where he's mercilessly hunted by Marley because he has passed off the Attack/Founder Titan to him/ has to commit mass genocide, OR decide to sterilize his race of people to die off old and miserable.

Also, giving him a for sure death sentence in 13 years."
DrDoctah,d-doing_your_mom,"What the fuck do you mean he turned out worse? He has nothing but love for his people,  his friends, and family; he wants them to be free."
d-doing_your_mom,themightyjimmmy,Love Eren forever but ngl the man is terrifying. 10/10 would prefer Zeke for a son
d-doing_your_mom,conopidaucigasa,"> He has nothing but love for his people, his friends

*Looks at Hange, Jean, Floch, Connie.*

Ahuh. Sure, buddy."
d-doing_your_mom,DrDoctah,"Bro it's just a joke, don't take it seriously. Also doubtful that kid Zeke would be able to commit the same kind of brutal manslaughter that kid Eren did.

Love the dude, but this is the same guy that's put his friends and family in a lot of distress and pain and committed genocide all for the sake of freedom."
d-doing_your_mom,ultimateweebalt123,"If you say that it makes him sound good, but he also committed global genocide. I think that’s worse than anything Zeke did."
DrDoctah,Ashton_Rarri,What’s worse than your son turning you in to the poop?
DrDoctah,BfutGrEG,"Carla genes cannot be contained, Shadis learned the ~~hard~~ soft way"
DrDoctah,RikxDragneeL,Wdym by turn out worse?

Mysterious-Tutor-942,None,"Yeah, that didn't really help out much. To know that you had already fucked up so badly as a parent that your son from the future encourages you to commit murder must've damaged Grisha pretty badly."

BonnaGroot,aiden328,Is Zeke really a racist though?
BonnaGroot,None,Eren commit omnicde but at least he is not a self hating Eldian.🙄
BonnaGroot,Egg_rice_28,It's a joke that doesn't make sense
DrDoctah,Thoutzan,"Grisha had his balls cut off by Marley. AOT grew it back.

So technically, Eren is born from AOT sperms.

DrDoctah,aearl42,"One of the most depressing things about Eren and Zeke's dynamic for me was that Eren was the son Grisha wanted while he was in Marley, and I think Zeke knows that."

TheLegitMind,None,Yeah but self genocide is still genocide.
TheLegitMind,None,"Forced sterilization still amounts to genocide as the end goal is still eradication of a group of people (subjects of ymir).

Similar to how deliberately starving a group of people or gassing them or lining them up to be shot en masse are ways to commit genocide. Keywords are ""deliberately"" and ""end goal"""

Tamashi42,Archmage_delta,Have my free award you genius!
DrDoctah,WellRested1,"While Grisha was a shitty dad with Zeke, there comes a point where his environment is just that toxic that it’ll change either him or his children. With Zeke, the treatment of Eldians in Liberio and the loss of his sister set him on that destructive path to free his people no matter what, even at the cost of his son. With eren, he learned and genuinely took care of both him and Carla as best as he could. But because the terrible treatment of Eldians extends across the ocean, Eren was molded by the environment in a way Grisha had no control over, without even considering the mission Grisha was responsible for the entire time. Grisha has it rough, man."
DrDoctah,None,AITA? I somehow raised a whiny asexual monkey and a genocide causing psychopath

JamesTheWicked,Troll4everxdxd,"They do get along in soldier program so yeah, you are probably right."
hhi78,Alucitary,"Nah, Erin would have grown up totally normal if not for Armin revealing the world to him. The only difference between him and Zeke is that Zeke grew up with oppression and was numb to it by the time he betrayed Grisha. Erin on the other hand realized his oppressions later and felt like his freedom had been taken from him. It's far easier to be angry about having something taken from you then to have never had something at all. Annie is definitely fucking not normal though."
DrDoctah,conconbar93,Grisha wtf bro. Just let them return to monke
DrDoctah,GrishaYeagersTears,Grisha raised his second child with love and affection and said child grew to become exactly who he wanted.
GrishaYeagersTears,ubermence,Exactly who *old Grisha* wanted. After arriving to Paradis and starting a new family there he kinda changed. Eren was actually the one that had to push Grisha into killing the Reiss family
ubermence,GrishaYeagersTears,No grisha was happy with who Eren became if you're tryna imply otherwise. He'd much rather Eren then some noname bland child.
DrDoctah,Walpknut,Grisha jizzes and just creates a different type of terrorist each time.
DrDoctah,Killergamer7,When you try to raise the kid that wants to be raised with love treating him as a warrior and raise with love the kid that wants to be treated as a warrior
DrDoctah,tesseracts,I wonder if the fact that Grisha was the attack titan when he conceived Eren means that Eren was born with some of the attack titan's personality.
tesseracts,Lightbringer34,"You might like [We Are The Nine](https://archiveofourown.org/works/26022157) then, where the Nine Titans have actual personalities. The Attack Titan has a special interest in and affection for Eren, in a similar sense."
tesseracts,Hyan-Daggreat,Interesting theory my guy

Obsessive_Consumer,putangas,By Carla
usayd2009,ConfidenceAdorable33,True lol
DrDoctah,legendarynoobie2809,Well he adopted a daughter and she did save humanity so atleast some redemption

DrDoctah,ReinerTrueMVP,Grisha clearly needs some parenting 1.01 classes ffs!
DrDoctah,Nuke-T00nz,"Maybe its the ""turning them into human weapons"" part"
DrDoctah,None,"Either Eren has always been a sociopath (I wouldn't be surprised though) or he got possessed by his future self. There's no way a 9 year old could commit murder like he did with the upbringing he had. Maybe he was assaulted on the streets by a pedo before saving Mikasa and he got traumatized by that. Or he was bullied to the point it broke him. It's really strange. I didn't know how to tie my shoes at 9, and this guy pulled a pretty good acting to murder a person, crafted a hand made ""spear"" to ambush a grown up dude, and then motivated another child to commit homicide."

DrDoctah,Luimidia,"This is the thing I don't understand. Why Eren was so f\*cked up as a child? Grisha raised him with love. He had mother and father who loved him. I know that sometimes influence of bad genes and mental  disorders like being sociopath happens but Eren was REALLY F\*CKED UP. HE WAS NINE. The only rationally explanation I have is that Eren was influenced by ""freedom call"" from Ymir, and future memories in his dreams"

DrDoctah,MrSkittles983,"Zeke loves killing people btw 

^just ^saying"
DrDoctah,Mr_Scoot,Love = genocide got it
DrDoctah,None,At least Eren commits genocide because he wants the guarantee of safety for the people of Paradis. He’s doing a wrong thing for a good reason. Zeke wants to euthanize an entire race because he wishes he was never born. He’s doing a wrong thing because of personal issues that developed in his childhood
DrDoctah,None,Bruh grisha VA in this episode was godlike. At this pace who knows how ch 121 would be like
DrDoctah,TheZJK,Maybe the whole “avenge your mother and protect everyone” is a good place to start.
DrDoctah,raechu_25,Poor old man Grisha always gets it *wrong*. Lmao.
DrDoctah,sixowl,Worst father of the year award goes to...
DrDoctah,Young_Marz07,I would argue unknowingly giving your young son 13 yrs to live and the fate of ur race in his shoulders is kinda tuff too

DrDoctah,LuminousLunar69,Love makes us appreciate being born into this world
DrDoctah,ArashiKudo190301,It's ironic when Grisha wants Zeke becomes Eren in Liberio and vice versa in Paradis
DrDoctah,None,Maybe it's because he raises children in the first place? 🤔
DrDoctah,CrystalGem15,Grisha is just cursed to not have a good family.
DrDoctah,BrianBrians12,Maybe Grisha should stop being a dad.....
DrDoctah,Choice-Fix2875,No way in hell Eren would have sold out his parent's. I get why Zeke did it but still NO WAY!
DrDoctah,Jibatsuko,"Let's be honest, Eren is the way that he is just because Reiner's bad decision. If they just sneaked instead of destroying the gates, the history would be very different"
Jibatsuko,None,Eren always a deranged side to him even before the walls brake down.
DrDoctah,the-laughing-joker,Why didn't Grisha just... not allow Eren to get to where he was when he did the whole ear whispering thing?

DrDoctah,jeankirschteinsgf,"well i mean, he basically only turned like that bc his mumma died 😩

DrDoctah,StarGazer042,Only one who messed up was Reiner
DrDoctah,Groose-Legacy,"Hmm.. they both had walls.. they both had threats outside the walls but Eren didn’t even fully understand what the threat was he had never actually seen a Titan until that day, could it have something to do with Paths ?"

jgags06,Zatheus,"As I explained in other post, at least GoT had the decency to fuck us for over 2 seasons of shit writing. Aot, although having some horrid chapters (137), was pretty consistent until that heavily concentrated dose of fuckery that was 139.

The letdown is a lot worse."
Zatheus,jgags06,Realistically I think everyone had such high hopes that when it wasn’t an 11/10 everyone is saying it sucks. The ending is prolly a 4 maybe 5 outta 10. Game of Thrones ending was literally like a 1. There were some positive moments from the final chapter. Id be surprised if you found more than 5 positives in the entire last season of GoT.
Zatheus,Inquisitr,I submit that most of the rumbling arc was pretty awful. We were all just expecting a good outcome and we're willing to see where it was going

jgags06,Hange11037,"Anyone who genuinely thinks this was worse than GOT is talking out of their ass. A controversial end to one character’s story and a couple loose threads isn’t great but isn’t nearly as bad as an entire couple seasons tearing down tons of characters and  storylines. It isn’t remotely comparable, people are just overreacting because people want to compare their frustration to something and GOT is the most recent thing that comes to mind. But that is what it is, an overreaction."
jgags06,Godsopp,Game of Thrones is just a crappy TV original ending based off a few bullet points they had same as every crappy anime original ending we've seen for years. Theoretically GRRM could still end the books and it could be amazing. Unlikely at this point but possible. This is it for AoT.

davi3601,CrimsonSaint150,"Yeah at least he tried. The GOT show writers purposely took a giant dump on the script because they wanted to finish their show and move on.

That being said, this sub’s reaction compared to the other subs has similarities to GOT. The r/freefolk and r/asoiaf sub was trashing the show starting in season 6 or 7. Where as the main sub r/gameofthrones was in love until the ending came up. This sub seems to be disappointed but the other sub is pleased.

Sahand_king92,None,"And then he turned into a bird. 


Funniest shit I’ve ever seen."
Sahand_king92,None,"Hilarious 

I know you might not be serious but

.. it's really been pissing me off how people keep hating that eren became a bird. Cause that bird was rather a symbolism of eren being free like a bird from the cage he was enslaved in.
Like this dude literally didn't morph into a bird. 
The real eren is dead."
None,None,"I would have been ok with it if the symbolism were a little more understated. But didn't Mikasa straight up say Eren's name aloud, like she somehow thinks the bird is him reaching out to her from beyond? If the characters in the actual story are talking about it, I think we can."
None,revivizi,"She was just reminiscing the moment when Eren wrapped the scarf around her.
It's just Mikasa not letting go of the scarf showing that she refuses to forget Eren. The bird might be symbolising Eren. That's it.

I can't believe that people think she somehow thought that the bird must be Eren so she decided to talk to him before he fly's away lol. If not for ""Eden becomes dove"" meme, no one would even had that kind of ridiculous idea"
None,get_r3kt_m8,Also the bird at the end is known as a Parasitic Jäger which is some extra symbolism.

Because his name means hawk in Italian.

SO DEEP GUYS

It's just the opposite of the nuanced writing we had pre-rumbling arc. The most surface level cliché dumb shit.

THE BIRD IS A PARASITIC YAEGER, WITH MIKASA'S SCARF, AND IT FLIES FREE!

OH MY GOOOOOOOOOD-"
None,Alternative-Draft-82,"But he's still a slave to Mikasa, even fixing up his scarf for her, AS A BIRD"
None,Celiac_Muffins,"I thought so too, but I shit you not he became a bird. There is a panel of Eren's memory shards and they're all from Eren's pov.... and one of those shows the conversation Falco had with a bird back in chapter 91. A bird sheds a feather to specifically Armin. Another bird then goes down and fixes Mikasa's scarf. He is a bird."

Sahand_king92,JamesSundy,God damn that chapter sucked
Sahand_king92,justchedda,"I love this video.

I don't know if you've personally made a big deal of this or not, but why is it such a big thing that Eren died a virgin?"
justchedda,Alantarx,"Well for one faction, ome people make a big deal out of that.  I'm not sure if it's related to a biological procreative drive or societal expectations.

For some like me, though, Eren having a kid would have softened the blow, which logically requires him to have had sex at least once."
Alantarx,grizmox5151,He could've at least left Mikasa a kid and indulged his selfishness--nope she dies alone now. Idk why but some EM's are happy with that.
justchedda,Mrtheliger,It's just a funny meme don't look too deep into it
justchedda,NenBE4ST,TBH i think aaron is canon now as a shared dream so its possible eren at least had sex in his mind.
justchedda,None,"Because Armin got pussy while people constantly shipped Eren with one of two girls (and many others too, like Pieck and Annie)."
None,wholelottavex,Who did armin fuck lol
justchedda,mybeepoyaw,Yuki banged Yuno within like a week. Eren had years.
justchedda,WonPika,"For me, it's just the shear stupidity of it. The fact that he threw an whole ass tantrum about Mikasa when he could have easily been with her and just *chose* not to seems extra pathetic and dumb. Worse because it feels like all of this rumbling bs just boiled down to his selfish desires to be with a women and not having the balls to do it but then cry over the thought of her moving on."
WonPika,justchedda,"[I......didn't expect something that pathetic...](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51102267341_d6f7218768_o.jpg)

Sahand_king92,kahzhar-the-blowhard,"I hope I don't have to point out that there's no fucking way the bird representing Eren is literal. The poor bastard was imprisoned, first by the walls, then by his visions of the future, and in death, he's finally 'free' (birds being a recurring, obvious symbol of freedom).

I know this is a joke, but an absurd amount of people seem to be taking that dove thing to be a legit criticism of the final chapter. There's shit wrong with the final chapter, but that thing ain't it chief. At best, it's just more of a ham-fisted repetition of an easy-to-understand metaphor."
kahzhar-the-blowhard,PeenG21,Finally someone said it
kahzhar-the-blowhard,BonGiornoGiovanna,"They're not joking about it because it's literal but because it's the most unsubtle and cliché symbolism possible. The opposite of the unique nuanced writing pre-rumbling.

THE BIRD FLIES FREE! IT HAS MIKASA'S SCARF! IT'S A SPECIES OF BIRDS CALLED PARASITIC YAEGER! OH MY GOD SO DEEP!

Like Falco's transformation.

OH MY GOD HE'S CALLED FALCO WHICH IS HAWK IN ITALIAN AND HE LIKES BIRDS SO DEEP

Sahand_king92,bigbane4u,This is literally and unironically how it went down. 139 is a huge troll chapter with a bunch of memes forced into it. You even have a page of Armin (Isayama) handing shit to Eren (reader) and thanking him (for our support). I think Isayama realized he wrote himself into a corner and rather than try to salvage something he couldn't salvage he drew a self-aware chapter making fun of all the lingering plotlines and the theories surrounding them.

You can feel free to downvote it if it makes you feel better, but I have yet to see a single argument that comes even close to making me think this ending was garbage. It was just below average by AOT standards, nothing amazing but not terrible either."

I kinda wish that Levi had died as well as everyone that had become Titans, but I don’t mind a few people having a happy ending. And I liked what he did with Eren as well. Seeing him show emotion and fear of death was humanizing for a person who we thought had strayed too far. And didn’t he say he started the rumbling so his friends could be heros?"
Sahand_king92,CringeBean,I honestly think Isayama made the ending as controversial as possible just to see more people in pain
Sahand_king92,ThaRealPhoenix,This was really funny. But it really mad out to be way worse than it actually is.

Sahand_king92,twinsfan94,Lmao there's things that i didn't like about the final chapter but saying it's worse than GoT is comical. Nothing redeeming about how GoT ended. I actually mostly enjoyed this ending and thought it was a solid 7/10. I genuinly feel like most people are trashing it mostly for the memes.
Sahand_king92,S1Ndrome_,"future eren controlled dina fritz (just like he controlled grisha) titan to kill small eren's mom. So that he would have the reason to be motivated to kill titans and join survey corps. He got that memory after he kissed historia's hand. And that whole small eren talking to small armin was just a display of how the time passed between these two friends and them talking about the memory eren regained. Small eren didn't had these memories from start. Seriously this can be figured out on its own easily if you watched or read the series carefully. It's a great ending with no linear ""titans are now gone the world is in peace forever yay!"" shit."

Sahand_king92,jk844,"As someone who doesn’t followed AoT that much. I watched the Anime when it first came out but have only seen it sporadically since then, and never read the manga I’d say “why does it matter?”

It’s his story, it’s always been his story and he can do whatever he wants with it. 

A lot of people don’t realise that most authors write stories they want to read. They don’t make them to stratify fans.

What I’ve seen the last few days (likely it’s been going on for years) from the SnK/AoT fan base is people demanding what they want, “I know better than the Author”. “I’ve been reading for years, I *deserve* a better end than this”. 

Actually there’s a word that perfectly describes what I’ve been seeing from “fans”........

Sad truth, a lot of fans here seem to really think that way. The world is not only made of simps and incels for Ymir's sake. What an virtual deviation of how complicated can relations be.

This ending felt very human and more realistic that what people would have expected. This is not the ending I expected at all, but it fits Isayama's work and more reading will make people accept it, maybe.

Maybe people don't like this ending because it couldn't be more tragic. I can get it. I think Isayama have always said this would be a tragedy.

Sahand_king92,DemoniteBL,"Wait, he killed his mom? How?"
Sahand_king92,Vyr0_DAF_,"Funny but a bit of it makes no sense. 

1. Eren was not confirmed to be a bird lol. I don't think birds are connected to the paths lol(Eldian birds lol)
2. The Paths might be gone so the Titan Dimension is gone so Eren's consciousness is dead(Eren told Armin that they would meet again so maybe not)
3. Eren didn't kill his mom, He was only able to influence Grisha(so he most likely couldn't prevent the walls from falling)
4. Ymir was in the final chapter through a flashback
5. The time loop theory lost a bit of likelihood(the flashback in Chapter 138 is a memory Eren replaced not a time loop. 
6.  Timeline theory does have a bit of a chance to be true.(Iseyama would have to give more credibility to the theory himself though)                                                                     Ymir shows 4th-dimensional perception. It could still be implied there was a time loop. Ymir chose Mikasa. You can argue that a timeline or timelines could exist where Ymir picks a different person to have faith in(to get rid of the founder's restriction/Ymir's slave state). 
7. AoT ending is a thousand times better than Game of Thrones ending in my opinion
8.  Reiner got to live(he overcame his desire to die) which signified a wrap-up to his emotional arc(being depressed, guilt-ridden, and suicidal). Reiner also got one of the biggest roles in the final battle of fighting the Creature that gave Ymir her Titan powers. 
9. Of course, not everyone would have been happy with the ending. That’s the case for most stories no matter how good they ended or how well like the story was."

Like, it's so ridiculous and insane that no one could've thought it up. Only in reality can this happen."
BioLizard18,Slappio16,"It really seems like if something from Japan gets censored, it's guaranteed to look ridiculous. In DBZ Gohan getting his head grabbed was considered too violent, so they tried editing it so he was being grabbed lower [and ended up with this abomination](https://imgur.com/gallery/4FqH2). When Sailor Moon got dubbed they decided to censor the lesbian couple by making them cousins, but they did a shitty job of trying to hide it so instead of a regular lesbian couple they were an incestuous lesbian couple."
Slappio16,Truchampion,Wtf Is that
Slappio16,Zeebuoy,">grabbed lower and ended up with this abomination.

I think dbz abriged referenced that."
flamingthunderbanana,kentuccysuccy,"What happens when the titan's body disintegrates?  Do the comically large pants stay behind? Do they disintegrate with the titan? Does the shifter take the pants and put them on the next time they transform? I don't need sleep, I need answers"

flamingthunderbanana,DirtBug,"As far as I am aware, there is no official local version published in Malaysia.

Gabriel_The_User,cidalkimos,Makes sense
cidalkimos,1fastman1,"Yeah, too far down to make a non pure titan. Unless you wanna get into some incest, but by that point I guess it was too late and now everyone either gets pure titans or they have to consume one of the 9"
Gabriel_The_User,None,[deleted]
None,None,[deleted]
None,dylan_klebold420,"I mean it's hard to compare it to real life biology to begin with, but mutations (change in one's genetic code, dna) spread throughout generations, are inherited basically. Blue eyes for example are a visible mutation that a lot of people inherited so much so that you could say a lot of them share a common ancestor. So, yes, your concept is logical and I think Isayama intended it to be this way. I'm not a Ph.D. in biology either though, so take it with a grain of salt."
None,ddizzlemyfizzle,"To add to that, I like to think that the pure titans eat people because the 3 daughters had to eat Ymir’s body. Maybe the trauma from that event was passed down to the pure titans"
None,None,"I think you pretty much covered it. This is such a cool and interesting aspect of the anime to discuss but I simply can't do it, this stuff is so complicated and none of this information has been explicitly given to us. At least not crystal clear and easy to decipher, leaving a lot of room open for discussion and headcanons."
None,Applinator,"In the words of Miike Snow, it got a little bit Genghis Khan."
Gabriel_The_User,lirbe,"I need evidence (in story). You can base it on hallu-chan or the norse, where there’s a connection to a limit of nine worlds, but that’s about it."
lirbe,None,Lmao. None of this is close to accurate. The level of mastery one has over the Titans is what is cannon regarding the depth of their ability.
Gabriel_The_User,TaffyLacky,"A theory I have is that a the consumption of a Founder's spinal fluid, or perhaps the spinal fluid of Ymir's titan, was what caused the genetics that connect Eldians to paths. Thus creating subjects of Ymir while keeping the royal line separate."
Gabriel_The_User,None,"Well we learned the Founder had control over its subjects compositions, therefore they have to have part of the original centipede life thing, and it would also make sense in another sense, which is maybe after some attempts of stealing the Founding, the holder decided to change the genes of the subjects so that only his family bloodline (Fritz) can use its power."
Gabriel_The_User,veritaserum9,"sorry, can you please tell me what a 'pure titan' is?

thank you"

nan,Zllls,"Never notice, only Cart Jaw and Beast are actually resemble animal."
Zllls,65alien56,jaw porco and marcel look like a weird cat and falco is a bird
65alien56,Mr_1ightning,Falco is a Jaw-Beast hybrid due to Zeke's spinal fluid.
65alien56,65alien56,i think ymir was stuck to her pure titan form because of the amount of time she was in it
65alien56,FewCranberry1767,Marcel and Porco’s jaw titan resemble lions as it represents their brotherhood
Zllls,ilcasu123,i think that the titan that got armin is a beast-cart hybrid
Zllls,ddbenson,what about that pig thing that had armin ??
ddbenson,Zllls,"My guess that its a Cart titan, Quadruped but no Fang or Claw."
nan,None,[deleted]
None,tamiscolaris,"Yeah that would line up with who Eren holds and Annie, Bert and Reiners trio. Also Pieck with Zeke and Porco."
tamiscolaris,None,"Yeah this makes more sense, we're grouping them into trios, and we already have trios established with RBA, and PZP.

Maria to me is like the controlling and free titans, the ones that can lead and control giving the sense of freedom that Eren yearned for.

RBA being warrior titans is self explanatory.

Sina's trio I don't know what it represents? What's the 3rd missing piece encompassed by what's lacking from Maria and Rose?"
None,minkdaddy666,"I also thought this one as well, the founder is the one that expands eldia, at the forefront creating infrastructure and crushing other nations. Rose is the defender, the two niche battle titans rounded out by females adaptability, a titan that defends the homeland while the founder is expanding it. Sina is the workhorse titan, clearing old unwanted titan crystal infrastructure as well as being able to plow and harvest the entire of eldias food supply."
None,Chemical_Leg_8547,"But I feel founding+attack+female is really more make sense because female titan is really connect with Founding, I think Yams don't give a fuck with thematic reason"
nan,None,So what’s the females ability?
None,None,I think it's adaptation because it has high mobility and endurance according to the Marleyan analysis of the titan.
None,None,"Maybe, I also think that the founding represents a direct lineage or is the one with true power of the source of all organic life(the worm). I think Maria probably ingested the worm and that’s how it got passed down. The founding basically inherits all the powers while the other 8 are specialized in certain areas. Like the armoured or beast titan. The other titans can also use armour and have animal like characteristics."
None,dylan_klebold420,Also the scream where she can somewhat control titans. Though it's not confirmed she can.
None,SnooHesitations1719,It said that the females ability was when it consumes another titan’s flesh it gains some of it’s abilities. That’s why she could harden and attract pure titans. She doesn’t need spinal fluid.
None,None,"But mobility and endurance isn’t unique to the female Titan, I would say that the scream is, but the fact that the female Titan is always female indicates to me that maybe it’s unique trait is taking on the appearance of Ymir, and the scream is part of that. The scream attracts descendants of Ymir to her and makes them try to eat her entire body, which reminds me of how Ymir was eaten by her children."
None,just_a_short_guy,But aren't high mobility and endurance cart titan's things?
None,Dubious_Unknown,"Female Titan name is Soo stupid.

  


Should've called it the Copy/Adapt Titan."
None,eyes0fred,"This was covered somewhat recently. The Female Titan is adaptable, and can basically take in diluted forms of the other titans abilities. Annie said it was why they fed her all sorts of gross shit in Marley. Her crystal ability was almost certainly from snacking on some tybur juice. And her scream controlling pure titans was most likely from Zeke's titan."
eyes0fred,None,"But all titans can do that. Eren did that in the cave, zeke has hardening, falco is a fucking bird. Jaw and cart both have animal like features. Cart even has steam abilities but too a lesser extent like the colossal"
None,None,I remember a manga chapter (130s) where it was revealed that the Female Titan can mimic other Titans' powers by eating a part of them.
None,None,All the 9 can do that. It’s not eating part of them it’s injesting their spinal fluid.
None,icemichael-,"I recall reading somewhere that its name was gonna be ""summoning titan"", i.e. she just lure pure titans.

Yams should have used that name tbh, 'cause ""female titan"" is just kind of.. meh."
icemichael-,Nada72kt,"I prefer to think the reason why he stuck with female titan is because when Annie made her first appearance as the titan, the most striking thing about it seemed to be the fact that she looked like a woman, despite all titans not having any feminine traits even if they initially originated from women. 

And our characters couldn't have immediately known it's a titan with the power to sumon others so just like how other titans were named after a striking physical feature (armored, beast, etc.), she was called female titan bc she looks like a giant skin-less lady. And then the name was kept to make it easier for the audience."
icemichael-,None,I thought she injested zekes spinal fluid to gain that power?
None,Lightbringer34,"She’s a jack-of-all trades, can do a limited scream, is more agile, and can harden local areas. Plus, 
Annie mentions that if her titan eats the flesh of another of the nine, she can temporarily copy their abilities."
Lightbringer34,None,I think your thinking of the fan translation. She only talks about injesting parts of the spinal fluid from the other titan not the flesh. Also all the other titans can mimic each other’s abilities through injesting spinal fluid
None,Yakube44,Having boobs and a fat ass
Yakube44,None,But that’s so OP wtf
None,joebrofroyo,"Its scream is unique i think, excluding the founder"
joebrofroyo,shadow144hz,Yeah isn't it the only one that brings titans to it when it screams?
joebrofroyo,None,I thought she got the scream from injesting some of zekes spinal fluid
None,Samariyu,"Adaptation. In recent chapters it's revealed that the Female Titan can partially assimilate the abilities of titans if she eats part of them. Before they left for the Paradis mission, Annie implies that she ate pieces of some of the other titan shifters' titan forms to partially gain their abilities. That's presumably why she has higher endurance (but not as high as Pieck's), higher defense (but not the extent of Reiner's armor), enhanced agility (but not as agile as the Jaw), etc.

Basically the Female Titan is the ultimate generalist, able to adapt well to changing situations but never quite as good at any one task as the specialist titans."
Samariyu,None,Well all titans are able to take each other’s abilities. The 8 titans all seem to specialize in a particular titan power it seems. And the founding titan is the one with complete power
Samariyu,None,She can also crystallize herself like the Warhammer
None,None,It also screams to attract nearby pure titans I think
None,jimmiefails,Bob
jimmiefails,None,🥵
None,VenzioArizory,"By eating the flesh of other titans she can copy certain aspects from them, such as Zekes scream, Piecks endurance, the warhammers crystal and Reiners hardening"
VenzioArizory,None,Not the flesh. That was a fan translation
None,None,"Doesn’t really have one, just like Attack Titan. Checks out with the abstract abilities thing"
None,None,Lol the attack titan can get future memories
None,Azevedo128,The scream. Her adaptability isn't an actual ability and it has more to do with how simple the Female titan is.
Azevedo128,None,The scream she got from zeke
None,treebend,"Edit: NVM, she can mimic abilities as stated below


What's the attack titans ability? The attack titan and the female titan just have the power of ideology."
treebend,None,Wtf? The attack titan can receive future memories lol. The attack titan doesn’t have an ideology it’s just Erens will being passed down and distorted due him passing down his memories to his predecessors. His predecessors don’t know it’s future sight or someone’s memories they believe it’s the titan itself that has this will.
None,None,Somewhere I read that she can adopt the traits of the other eight titanes by eating a part of their flesh so I think she embodies adaptation.
None,None,No that was a fan translation
None,im_covid_positive,Titties
nan,NanoLzaerthe1,This is some big brain shit
nan,None,"Titans seperation is also something I thought about and I would say Founding, Warhammer and Attack were the first three titans, hence why Eren ate it at Liberio and combined three sisters' powers in him. When three daughters got eaten by their own children, one child had their mother's titan, two other children would take forms related to it maybe?"
None,Lightbringer34,"I always assumed Founding and Female were two that manifested in Ymir’s children, simply because she had 3 daughters. What power the 3rd Titan would have, I think it wouldn’t be Attack, who’s anti-authority."
Lightbringer34,Bobathanhigs,It’s only anti authority because of Eren though. Otherwise it does have the more PATHS related skill set what with controlling its memories
None,Chemical_Leg_8547,"Well eren steal Warhammer because he need tybur memories, third titan obviously Female titan because Female titan is just nerf version of founder"
nan,ThePeanut,What happends if the female titan shifter gets fed to a male charachter ?
ThePeanut,loldan79,"ch136 might have answered that (https://i.imgur.com/LYhUbd0.png)

nan,Zllls,Actually seem legit. Nice
nan,None,Kino theory . I love infographic theories man .
nan,None,I'd like it if Isayama gave an out of universe explanation on this part after the manga ends.
None,None,"he did. In 122 when Ymir was being eaten he said, and have your children eat your spines"" So Ymir's kids died of the 13 year curse, and Ymir's 9 grandchildren ate their spines. 

I like to think Eldians not related to Ymir were charged with eating the spines of her grandchildren, so the royal bloodline wouldn't be burdened by nine of them dying every 13 years. 

This would create one group of Eldians with royal blood( descendants of Ymir) and another group of Eldians who are decants of those who ate Ymir's grand children. effectively explains the difference between royal blood and plain cursed Eldians blood."
None,FerroEtIgne,I'm expecting some of Ymir's descendant create non-regal lines
None,Ragu262,"I thought non subject of Ymir eldians were the nobles, besides the ackermans ofc. The one dude in the shit machine tells zackley how his blood is slave’s blood"
None,Avaruusmurkku,"Nah, its been stated that every single eldian is a direct blood relative of Ymir. The royal bloodline is just a title, Ymir was obeying the King due to Stockholm syndrome, so whoever was named his successor would be the new ""king"" and so would their children and so on. The title passed from King Fritz to one of his daughters, and from one of the daughters to her children, creating a distinction between royal- and non-royal bloodlines.

Think of it like strong versus weak claim in noble inheritance."

None,baconborg,Lmao what?
None,DoubleUniversity7413,I know that this is a month old but imo a better explanation is that the curse of Ymir is that you die 13 years after awakening your Titan abilities. And there are 9 Titan shifters. 13 years + 9 Titans = 139 chapters
nan,Lorallynn,The malding titan
nan,Vaverka,Why did they stop spliting titans tho?
Vaverka,ThomazAc3,"Maybe when they tried to split them again they created the pure titans, still titans but with no abilities, this probally resulted in the invention of the spinal fluid"
nan,hawk363,So Eren has founding titan + attack titan he only needed the female titan to become the principal titan but he has Warhammer titan instead
hawk363,htmlrulezduds,"The founding titan basically gives the access to paths where you can reach the godlike power, that's why Ereh could turn into a Colossal last chapter, he could do whatever he wanted to"
htmlrulezduds,hawk363,"Oh yeah you are right, having control of PATHS makes you  as powerful as god lol (only for eldians)"
htmlrulezduds,Lostcentaur,He didn’t turn into colossal. That’s what’s he’s true founding titan form looks like. If he got his head shot off
nan,None,I think that the founding represents a direct lineage or is the one with true power of the source of all organic life(the worm). I think Maria probably ingested the worm and that’s how it got passed down. The founding basically inherits all the powers while the other 8 are specialized in certain areas. Like the armoured or beast titan. The other titans can also use armour and have animal like characteristics.
None,JoufulKiller,Sorry to ask but what worm? I don’t remember reading about Ymir eating a worm
JoufulKiller,None,[removed]

robo243,None,So you just accept a hypothesis as canon with no proof? Ffs people be smarter
None,robo243,It's a shame a smart guy like you completely misunderstood my comment.
None,Blackpowderkun,Headcanon.
nan,KasiaHmura,Only now that when it said that  Niddhog is a worm that chews on the roots of the tree I realised that this white worm thing is actually Niddhog
KasiaHmura,degaart,There's also another creature that smokes the tree: Snoopddhog
KasiaHmura,logan4301,"Wow, I didn’t realize that until just now either"
nan,None,[deleted]
None,azullllll1,"I think the ""all eldians are descendants of ymir"" thing is just a saying and the founding titan power only works with the royal family members because ymir still feels enslaved by them or she feels the king presence or something like that."
azullllll1,None,[deleted]
nan,Giamm2,"Cool, chart, but I have some problems with it. First: if the Founding Titan is part of the Principal Titan's Heritage than what is Ymir? Wasn't she THE Founding Titan?"
Giamm2,None,Ymir's titan is actually all the titan powers combined and she's still the founder. The chart just shows how her powers including the founding titan was divided with her other powers among the current 9 titans from 3 conceptual titans which were her daughters based upon Yggdrasil the tree in Norse Mythology.
None,Giamm2,Oh ok
Giamm2,Zllls,"She is all of them. There is no clear name for her, she just the first titan.

After she die and her daughter ate her. The power got separated.

Much took a lot of years later for people to find out the power of controlling the Eldian and create mindless titan because back then she was the only titan Eldian. That power so OP they call it the Founding titan."
Zllls,-delightfull-,Saying that she has all of them is also an assumption. All we know is that when she died the power birthed 9 titans powers
nan,joebrofroyo,"This is really cool, also that molding titan would be op as fuck"
nan,XxRocky88xX,"I’m pretty sure the 3 then 9 thing is cannon, the only thing about this that’s conjecture is what powers each of those 3 had"
nan,Fepl31,"Very well done theory.

I see that Colossal and Jaw could be swapped, as Jaw has hardening, can break other's hardening, and the Colossal still counts as a Monster. But that's up to debate."
Fepl31,Blackpowderkun,Beast Colossal titan = Kaiju titan.
nan,Alternative-Draft-82,"Lol, you wanted an explaination from the author, nope. Only the founder, Ymir knows."
nan,None,Maria could have never imagined her own titan would've demolished her Wall.
nan,Drisurk,"This is amazing, I will accept this as my own canon 😬"
nan,cavsalmostgotswept,"So which one is Rose, Sheena, and Maria?

I'd assume Maria, being the outermost wall would have Attack titan who seeks freedom and Female titan who's adaptive so it's Principal

Sheena being Monstrous and having the most beastlike powers would be ironic considering Wall Sheena is supposed to house the aristocrats and the royals

Rose having Molding Titan with 2/3 of it being the cause of humanity pushed inside her Wall is fitting too"
nan,None,"This is very cool, one of my favourite parts of the show to discuss right here.

I like to think that as the titan powers are passed down they are actually weakened, if they are split into branches like this. i.e. Armin's colossal titan should be no different to Bertholdt's because it was a simple transfer of the same thing, it wasn't divided into any parts. The strongest titan isn't a result of being exceptional in its specialised area; i.e. colossal being size, warhammer being hardening and generating weapons etc. but the real power is being the sum of all parts.

Which is exactly why Eren's such a formidable titan, he didn't become such a huge threat as he is currently until now, where he is 3 titans in one, 2 from principal and 1 from molding. 

Then again, I still don't know how the fuck he became a colossal titan in the latest chapter. Can someone fill me in on this one please? Is it that the founding titan can become any form it wants, as well as being able to command and control all other titans? Is that the idea?"
None,None,I assume that the founding titan can take on more than one form considering we see Frieda's titan who is average size but then also see Ymir's titan that is absolutely massive.
None,None,"How big is Ymir's titan?

It looked like it could be a 120m titan, without the drawbacks and extreme slow speed that Colossal and deformation of Rod's titan.

Ymir's titan was like, the physical peak of optimal performance."
nan,EntertainmentMore624,Why is Royal blood different when all eldians are descendants of ymir?
EntertainmentMore624,Rosselman,Probably the daughter that got the founding titan is the one that started the royal blood descendants. Just speculation.
EntertainmentMore624,htmlrulezduds,"the ""royal blood"" thing is more related to the fact Ymir was a slave to King Fritz.

When she died and she became one with the paths, this mentality came with her and she became a slave to every descendant to the King, that's why she only answered to ""royals"" in paths even though anyone could inherit the founding but couldn't use its powers"
htmlrulezduds,sdlntr,"Then why did zeke's death stop the rumbling ?

Because in this case after Ymir was freed Zeke shouldn't have any influence on the FT powers anymore"
EntertainmentMore624,None,"The same way *all* royal blood is different than their respective populations IRL. 

We all descended from some common ancestor, yet royal families came about. It's basically incest + marrying other royals/nobles. Everyone is related to Ymir, there is just a lineage that is considered royal."
nan,Gusebaloney,"I was trying to get my head round how Ymir's 3 daughters' titans turned into the 9 and I think this explains it nicely. Adding this to my head canon now, thanks"

nan,None,this is cool
nan,isthatmyphonecharger,Isayama who just randomly came up with them and couldn't be bothered to explain: Oh. Yeah that makes sense too.
nan,MasterOfChaos6,"I respectfully disagree. I think the three daughters of Ymir had the following titans: (Colossal, Armored, Female), (Beast, Cart, Jaw), (Founding, Attack, Warhammer).
My reasoning is based on Reiner, Bertoldt, and Annie being a trio. And Zeke, Pieck, and Porco being the other trio. Eren has the last three."
MasterOfChaos6,Chemical_Leg_8547,"Well warrior supposed to be four, zeke, pieck and porco aren't trio and eren steal Warhammer titan because he needs tybur memories have nothing to do with Ymir daughter
Female titan pretty much connect with founding from appearance and mimick power and attack with future and past memories thing, same with Warhammer and Armored obviously connect like weapons and shield and colossal as body and last cart, jaw and beast connect because they are titan who resembles animals, really have nothing to do with current event"
nan,Aidanh999,I think there isnt locked in powers. Transforming with intention just takes lots of practice. Generations of practicing dramatically different things has led them to all be pretty different but overall they use the same power.
nan,None,"I just had an idea , if Ymir is thought to be reincarnated in Historia's baby wouldn't that mean that her titan powers would have to be brought back , meaning all the current shifters will die . We've got Zeke dead , Eren is supposed to be dead ( 4 titans so far ) , Pieck , Annie and Reiner are fighting the Worm and Armin is fighting Eren's CT while Falco flies around with Levi . 

It would be easy to conclude that the three fighting the worm will get killed by it , and not eaten by Pure Titans . The only way Armin would die is if Eren's CT is still active and fighting , which is possible since we don't see if Mikasa actually stopped it and there's also Eren's dialog with his that who goes ''We must keep Fighting , even if we die , even AFTER WE DIE'' ( I can't remember it exactly ) . If Eren's titan is still moving than it could be the end for Mikasa tho.

I can't see how Falco would die in this Scenario , he could just fly away or do a sacrifice to save Armin , or revenge him if he dies , there are many options ."
None,cidalkimos,Don’t makes sense...Armin is telling the story. He doesn’t die.
nan,None,"I agree with the monstrous titan but not the other 2

My take is

Warrior titan: attack, armor, and warhammer

God(dess)/Divine titan: founding, colossal, and females"
nan,None,this is a cool connection but doesn’t really add anything to the story or lore it’s kinda like knowing a characters favorite color
nan,None,I discussed this exact thing with an anime-only friend but I actually (probably biased by the knowledge of hallu-Chan) put them on a scale of inorganic to organic matter and came up with a different 3 branches. Although my branches weren’t that different.

nan,NicolBolasUBBBR,In my head this is canon now
nan,VeryShortLadder,Some time ago I had the same idea of how the titans split from the founding but it's way less complex than yours. It's cool how we used almost the exact same images and the beast branch is practically the same
nan,ThickAsianAccent,What’s the deal with Rod Reid’s’ titan in this hypothesis?
nan,Skylinens,This is so dope
nan,itamer76,I always had this as my head cannon
nan,I-already-redd-it-,"This makes me think, can the titans be split even further? Like if two people ate the beast, should it become two separate, weaker, titans?"
nan,Samariyu,I don't care if it's rendered not canon. It's canon in my heart.
nan,Substantial-Tip-2607,"Well done, I like this theory because then the Female Titan can be the Survival or Adaptive Titan that represents the will to live of Ymir along with her ideology (Attack) and royalty (Founding)."
nan,ElMondoH,"Wow. This is a seriously nice theory. I wish there was more story to tell, because then we can see if anything else in the storyline supports this idea. Too bad it's so near the end. 

Regardless, I like this. Very well done."
nan,hiyorisia,"Hey, I have a question, it's probably stupid but whatever:

All Eldians are descendants of Ymir and there's the royal bloodline, starting with the tribe's ruler, Fritz.There are a few people of royal blood, like Historia and Zeke. Shouldn't everyone be of royal blood tho? Every Eldian is an ancestor of Fritz.

Why is thatt..."

nan,Merces95,please. i want the photo from left corner up
nan,No-Seaweed-4456,Another post to show how not smart I am
nan,None,"I mean this makes the most possible sense, considering that when the powers were split between Ymir’s three daughters the first time, each would most likely have three powers each, which would be interesting to see. Then each daughter would divide their powers three times again, leading to the nine titans. Putting the founding and attack titans together seems ironic to me, one Titan is constantly striving towards freedom and the other’s power is made to oppress others."

nan,AnApeWithSuit,"Y'know what? I like this, makes sense."

Shouldn't the female titan be in the Molding titan category? Doesn't she harden her muscles at will?"
ReaperZ13,None,"Annie once said that it was easy for the female titan to show and execute abilities which are normally visible among the other intelligent titans. Like versatility, hardening etc. This happened due to the excessive experimentation on the titan by Marley.

nan,OhIsMyName,"Holy​ shit​ i​ used​ to​ think​ like​ this, glad​ im​ not​ alone."
nan,Aminemohamed24,I like that
nan,BlueJayWC,Isn't the female titan's gimmick that it has extensive hardening abilities tho?
BlueJayWC,G_Ranger75,I think the Female titans gimmick is that she is very adaptive and is very flexible in comparison to the other Titans (minus the Berserk/Attack Titan). I believe this because Eren was able to master the hardening technique for his Attack Titan.
nan,fbomb_REDDIT,"Principal, or *principle?*"
nan,Cyb3rnaut13,AoT sure has a grim dark fantasy.
nan,G_Ranger75,If the Titan power goes to a random Subject of Ymir after they die then wouldn't the powers be split among Ymir's three daughters? Which would mean that she didn't get consumed by them?
nan,Jordan_888,Dang is that norse mythology? I gotta read the manga now
nan,Fruit_011,I don't think the colosal can harden. Unless it hasn't used it. I've only seen Eren use hardening in the most recent chapter. He does look like a colosal. But I still don't know how he turned to one
nan,furiana,Ohh! I like it. :)
nan,dudedoesgames,"So is Sina the principle (because she has the founder),
Rose the monstrous ,
And then Maria the molding (because she makes up the largest wall)"
nan,Psychological-Hope46,"There was actually a panel in the manga showing the onslaught of the original titans back in Ymir's time. I'm not sure what chapter it was, but I remember counting the titans and discussing it with my friends. There were only 8, and the obvious omission was the Attack Titan. The original 8 were used to conquer and were a part of King Fritz's will, but the Attack titan was completely separate. I believe it was a manifestation of Ymir's repressed desire for freedom, explaining why it wasn't there, why it went missing (was being the long generational journey to achieve Ymir's and Elida's freedom), and why Eren was a slave to it. 

It wasn't that the Attack was free, it was that the Attack titan was a slave to achieving freedom, a tragic but actually pure embodiment of the freedom. 

At the end, the culmination of every attack titan's actions come to fruition: Ymir and Eldia are free, and the titans are no more. That's also why Eren, Grisha, and Kruger all say at some points in the story that they're not sure they had a certain desire or choice within them, they were being influenced by the attack titan. Eren's sees all this after kissing Historia's hand, and from that moment on, he's a changed character. He's almost emotionless, never shows joy or a smile, and separates himself from his friends. He's realized the future of his determination to kill all the titans, and the reasons as to why he was so set on freedom from youth: genocide and to full-fill the mission of the Attack Titan. I honestly thought the ending was perfect, if rushed, but there's a reason for it being rushed. It needed to end in April, the start of spring, and on chapter 139. 13 being Mikasa (the only numbered panel in the entire manga is page 13 in chapter 1 showing Mikasa, chapter 13 is Mikasa's childhood and meeting Eren, and her song is called 13 winters: she waits 13 years for spring to arrive, the 13 years being Eren's 10 years as a Titan and the 3 she journeyed back to Paradis.

MonoChrome16,DoItNowMikasa,"Truthtellers have historically been persecuted.

 Eren can’t pretend to be a part of the sheep/cattle living everyday just eating and sleeping. This annoys them.

Armin keeps debating the settled science. This attracts bullies. 

Erwin thinks the history books are a lie and that the government is run by a cabal of satanists and cannibals. He gets tried for treason.

Erwin’s father taught the truth and was suicided.

Pastor Nick became a whistleblower, but got suicided.

Dimo tries to redeem himself but gets murdered.

The young journalist knew he was reporting propaganda but wished to keep his job.

Grisha knew the truth but decided to live selfishly. He was of course persecuted with a vaccine just prior.

Freckled Ymir knew the truth but decided to live selfishly. She was of course persecuted with a vaccine just prior.

Kruger committed heinous acts just to keep his cover as a truthteller.  He used a doctor to forge his blood information.

Zeke became a willing pawn of the government in order to get closer to his final solution. His father forcefed him the truth and he rebelled.

Reiner is surrounded by fake news and has no concrete way to dispute it without becoming a social outcast. He is severely depressed.

All characters with little in the way of friends and continually persecuted or ridiculed.

“What is the lie? What is the truth? What to believe?”

usayd2009,Flourek,"Grisha said to Krüger sonething along the lines of: ""why are you telling me all this if I won't remember it anyway"" (because of being turned into a pure titan) and Krüger responds with: ""who knows, but someone  down the line might be watching"". Therefore Grisha doesn't remember it himself but Eren could see the memory"
Flourek,usayd2009,"Grisha did say to Eren the same line, of saving mikasa and armin. During the second Eren transformation when he protected his friends from the cannon shot in season 1, you can hear it. It gives me chills everytime."
usayd2009,Gragh46,"I believe he remembered Mikasa from Kruger's line. When he took Eren to Mikasa's house (and the parents had been killed, Mikasa kidnapped, etc), before knocking on the door Grisha was telling Eren that the Ackermans had a daughter that was the same age as him, and he should be friends with her. 

Why would Grisha bother bringing his son to the middle of the wood? Because he had learnt that there was a girl living here with the unusual name Kruger had said, and like Armin was Eren's best friend, Mikasa would also be important in Eren's life"

We do know that the vast majority of the Pure Titans on Paradis were turned by Marley against their wills, but we do not know for certain that the FT always turned Eldians into Pure Titans against their will.

LosMichalos,None,"I posted this on snk sub but it’s relevant.

The brilliance of aot is that, for just about all of human history, “humanity” has been “whoever the hell you know within the walls of your city/village/etc”. Everything outside the walls resides in an unknown scary place, and the others who look different from us and who speak an unknown tongue are “monsters”.

Over 800 years ago, when the Mongols were sacking cities constantly, sometimes putting hundreds of thousands, if not millions to the sword, do you think it would be fantastical or ridiculous for the doomed inhabitants to believe the Mongols to be monsters? Yes, I get it, they weren’t literal giants and they didn’t eat their victims alive. But if the walls of your city were broken into and everyone you knew was suffering a painful death and/or worse, what really would be the difference??? 

And btw, this wasn’t just a Mongol thing, it wasn’t just a western conquistador thing, it’s a human thing. A tragic reality of having been born into this cruel world. And until we accept that every race, every individual has the potential to become a monster, or view the other as monsters, we’re doomed to just repeat the same mistakes over and over again.

But according to some people, we shouldn’t draw parallels to the real world or real human history, or at least we should downplay and/or ignore these lessons. “lol it’s just an anime bro chill.” Methinks some people are uncomfortable confronting their own “righteous” biases. Cognitive dissonance is a bitch, especially when it’s revealed through the amazing roller coaster that is identifying with the Eldian people of Paradis."

This. People would deny the reality they live in when confronted because, among other things, that means they should change their paradigms and the way they think. Most people want to believe we are always good, and kind, and want to forget about the atrocities that were done in the past. It's easier and much more epic to tell the tales of the conquerors like they were heroes, when most of them were just mass murderers. like when kids think war is exciting, because of how they experience it through videogames or epic movies."

Trauma olympics are pretty silly, but overall I don't think it's possible to say Eren had been through that much more of it than Gabi.

Eren also wasn't stranded amongst his ""enemies"". If kid Eren had found himself outside the walls amongst a bunch of small titans that were actually friendly to him in complete opposition to what he would expect, you don't think he'd be acting erratically and be prone to further outburst of violence if he felt threatened."

LosMichalos,Psyga315,"I can't exactly blame Gabi for this.

For one, this crap was drilled into her head and she was basically brainwashed into thinking all Eldians are evil and that she was ""one of the good ones"".

Second, and I might be misremembering here, the Eldians *did* rule with an iron fist back in the day and the Marleyans *were* being oppressed. However, this has become a case where the Marleyans are doing the exact same thing the Eldians were doing without any trace of irony and any irony that *is* noticed gets quickly swept under the rug. 

TL;DR: Marley had a point, but they decided to be assholes about it."
Psyga315,papawinchester,I think Falco being able to empathize with their enemy despite undergoing the same warrior training is what makes Gabi so unlikable to me. Shes a young Eren 2.0 but didn't see a titan eat her mom or any of the terrible things that she was taught. I dislike her as a person but not as a written character if that makes any sense.
papawinchester,5Sk5,"She saw her friends getting crushed to death, stomped to death. Nation get blown up and massacred and a lot more. Meanwhile, Falco saw Eren and Reiner's dialogue, he saw first hand what this war has caused to Reiner and could quickly, as a character with a lot of sympathy, understand what was actually going on. Gabi now is basically Eren after seeing his mother being eaten, but this time he could actually do something about it"
papawinchester,NenBE4ST,"I think the difference is that falco is genuinely one of a kind best boy, meant to contrast gabi who would have been ok but she had a huge fucking ego trip when she was hailed as a war hero. A lot of people say gabi bad because of war crimes but i see it as her doing what she could to prove herself for her family and save the lives of those eldian suicide fighters. That ego trip made her actually feel wanted and unlike other warriors, the brainwashing made her fully onboard with the idea that eldians can be first class citizens and if they can end paradis, the worlds problems can be solved (which is true but still really bad for other eldians so shes wrong here). Furthermore, when those paradis devils attack and kill her friends it goes directly against her goals and the people she cares about are brutally murdered when she believes things were looking up so its natural for her to be enraged. She becomes capable of cold blooded murder which is her low point, but at heart she wasnt a bad person, and eventually grew up. Falco never had that ego trip, his dad was an eldian restorationist so he had a different upbringing, and in general is just super good natured."
papawinchester,baconborg,Well not everyone is the same dog. Kinda unfair to compare the character written to be empathetic from the start to the character who’s going through an arc to learn kindness with said person
papawinchester,luigitheplumber,"Falco wasn't raised by the Braun family, Gabi was getting actively brainwashed 24/7 growing up.

And besides, just because Falco is exceptionally mature in this way doesn't mean you can just hold it against other kids for not being like that.

If I drop ten kids in the middle of the wilderness for 3 months, and one makes it back alive, I don't just get to write off the 9 dead ones just because one was resourceful enough to make it."
Psyga315,Legendver2,"Whatever Eldians and Marleyans did hundreds of years ago wasn't the point. The point was Gabi is quick to disregard the evils on her side with ""I didn't see it happen"", but brings up shit from thousands of years that none of them can possibly ""see happen"" and using it against the ""other""."
Legendver2,Cello_not_Violin,"And that is totally natural. 
How many Americans do you think hate/dislike all muslims for 9/11, but do not care for or ignore the fact, that in the war on terror, the US killed a lot of Civilians i  Drone Strikes as ""colataral damages"" or ignores its own justoce system when detaining suspected terrorist.
And they do it mostly because ignoring your sides fault makes it much easier for you to still feel good and happy. 
So before anyone goes around and bashes people for their behaviour, maybe they should look at themself first"
Psyga315,ramanps,Well if you go like that. You can't really blame anyone for anything because we all are the product of our environment.
ramanps,Psyga315,Exactly. That's the whole point of Attack on Titan.
Psyga315,Sugarpeas,"I think the reason why people have a such a strong reaction against Gabi, is because we all know a ""Gabi"" and they can be awful people. People raised with bigotry engrained into them from their upbringing, and they stubbornly refuse to see their views of the world is wrong when faced with evidence. What's frustrating to me about Gabi is she's being forced to see her views are wrong, *head on*  and she still can't seem to come to terms with it. Here she is, being treated well by an Eldian Family within the walls and she can't help but lose her mind over it - she can't accept that the Eldian's within the walls may be good people.

Child or not, seeing a 12-13 year old act like this would probably yield a harsh impression even from adults.

A real life example I grew up with, was homophobia. I *personally* was heavily encouraged to hate gay people growing up. I even parroted hateful comments that my parents made all the time. However, suddenly I met a few gay people in High School, and my bigotry was challenged and subsequently dissolved. It took one or two encounters to challenge my world view. Conversely, there were people in my High School that continued to be a bigot despite evidence. They constantly lashed out at gay students in my class, and to my understanding many of them today actually have remained bigots.

Teenagers, and children are actually the most likely to change their bigoted views in face of evidence. If they're resistant to changing their views at this age... it's unlikely to ever happen.

While Gabi was brainwashed growing up, she's also at the age where she is becioming responsible for her viewpoints. At this point, she's no longer ignorant of what kind of people are behind the wall of Paradis, and she's choosing to ignore what she's seeing. This is a dangerous kind of person.

To be clear though, I do think Gabi is a well written character, but I don't understand how people can claim that her being a victim of environment means you can't ""hate"" her. A lot of bigotry is taught, and is ""generational,"" but after a certain point people who carry forward that ""learned hate,"" especially in the face of challenging evidence, are then responsible for it."

LosMichalos,GameXterminator,"For the Last 100+ Years, Marley did Exactly that. Dumbass. 

I'm on Team Eren. Can't have one nation oppressing another if there's only 1 nation left."
GameXterminator,KupaKeep,"Before the people of Paradis knew there were any other nations, they still found things to fight about. People will always find ways to make conflict. Whether it's between neighboring towns, countries, planets, etc. 

We can find unity in conflict (like the rest of the world uniting against Paradis), but as soon as the common enemy is gone, we start looking for the next one."
KupaKeep,None,Can I give this 10 upvotes please?
KupaKeep,rajagopal2001,"This , Eren wiping out the world would solve nothing. His people will kill each other and the cycle will continue all over again."
KupaKeep,G_Riel_,"Eren is not trying to solve all the conflicts, just the conflicts against the other nations."
KupaKeep,ReichLife,Conflict within Paradis about which you're talking about would result in death toll of between tens thousands to none. Outside world meanwhile literally wants to exterminate them all. Comparing Paradis-Humanity conflict with future Paradis ones borders on ignorance.
GameXterminator,Mentalious,you could argue that with only nation they could be conflict from within
Mentalious,None,You don't have to argue it we literally saw it. I may be getting wooshed here but this was the uprising arc.
GameXterminator,None,"They'll just oppress themselves again like we saw during Uprising arc. Yeagerists were responsible for public beatings and executions. Why would they suddenly stop doing that if they were doing it even after rumbling was activated ? Floch and Eren are gone which means that they're leaderless now. There's no way that all those people they pissed off during their coup won't take advantage of this situation and retaliate. 

Not to mention we still don't know ecological repercussions of rumbling. Eren is destroying not only humanity outside the walls, but also 99% of planet's ecosystem. Forests and oceans are burning all over the planet and global temperature will definitely increase.

Just imagine if Eren accidentally fucks up Paradis crops. Paradis would inevitably fall into famine and civil war."
None,InfamousMachine33,Do they live? If yes then Erens goal would have been achieved. The ramifications are secondary. Assuming he actually achieved his goal tho.
GameXterminator,koeseer,"Assume Eren won and just flat pancake whole world so only Paradis left.

What do they gain from that? They have lost basically whole world and nobody to trade with.

They probably did well as a self sufficient community until 5 years ago. But, they have taste technology imported from outside world. There's no way they're gonna back to way before with medieval level of technology."
koeseer,None,[removed]
koeseer,NenBE4ST,"furthermore i just think that wiping the entire globe of all ecosystems and cultures is an unforgivable atrocity, regardless the reason. Not that i hate eren or anything, i love his character and i think there is a lot more to him than genocide chad. But i dont think isayama anticipated this many people actually needing such a heavy convincing argument against global massacre lol"
koeseer,papawinchester,I mean its not like they'd be unable to go out and explore the world then right? And if they really were on Paradis for only 100 years before Reiner and Co infiltrated then they are some very ingenious people these folks from Paradis. Im sure they'd be more than capable of moving past their current technology and settling nations outside of Paradis just fine. Although I'm just an anime watcher so idk anything in detail from the manga
GameXterminator,Pblake99,Can’t have racism if you kill all the races except one
GameXterminator,kilik147,Please never run for a position of power

GameXterminator,10messiFH,"yeah you're right, but I'm going to go one step further and say can't have anyone oppress anyone ever again if no one is alive!"
GameXterminator,NewCountry13,Humanity will never stop fighting itself until it shrinks to a size of one or fewer.
GameXterminator,MyKey18,"If you’re taking sides then congratulations, you missed the entire point of the fucking show. And unfortunately oppression will always exist, that was one of the main messages in season three. Did you even watch the show??"
MyKey18,BRUHYEAH,"Nobody here has. This sub has been sucking off Eren entirely lmfao. I came here to actually see people talk about how fucked up everyone is in the manga, not to see people agree with someone committing genocide, which the author very clearly paints as the one in the wrong."

huysolo,Certain_Swim_4032,"Yeah, other option is to just get killed by everyone else, much fucking better dumbass"
LosMichalos,None,"I don’t blame Gabi for her ignorance. It’s not her fault that this was the sort of information that she was told growing up—she’s a very impressionable child. I sympathize (maybe even empathize, growing up Asian in America) with her circumstance and her internalization of self-hate of her own race. A lot of people seem to hate her, but I would hope that people don’t hate her just because she repeats what she’s told. I personally enjoy her role as the ignorant child, who then grows to learn that the truth is a lot more complicated."
None,WolfTitan99,"Yeah I just feel sad for her at this point. I am a little put off by her stubbornness, but thats what happens when your entire life up to this point ends up not mattering for her family or Liberio and everything you have ever known is just turned on it's head, so I can understand why she reacts this way. 

She's scared and desperately wants her beliefs to be true, but shes met with resistance time and time again, so she gets angrier and buries her head in the sand. She only comes around after a while."
None,DJGiblets,"Ya, I know it's not the main theme of the show, but as an Asian-American as well, the internalized racism really hit home. Also hinting at some model minority stuff. She's one of the *good* Eldians, she's not like other Eldians! She'll kill every Paradise Eldian if it means securing a spot for Marleyian Eldians, even if that spot is just as a second class citizen."
None,Legendver2,"You can call it ignorance, or just her being willfully blind. She WAS given the facts, but she chose to disregard it if it didn't fit the narrative she believed in."
Legendver2,NenBE4ST,"she was given those facts but that directly contradicted with what she was taught. Remember that part of the reason why the propaganda was so effective was because she was hailed as a war hero and in general was super successful and on the track to save her family and achieve a better life. Naturally when that was all torn apart from the liberio raid and her life was ruined she would be super angry, and even irrational. It took a while for her to come around and realize the true nature of the world"
Legendver2,baconborg,"Imagine if all your life you were told one thing then in the middle of a pretty crazy event you learned the opposite was true

You’d be pretty fucked in the head too"
Legendver2,None,"Again, I think her being rather young is important. At such a young age, Gabi was being hailed as a hero. Becoming an honorary Marleyan and a key Eldian soldier for Marley meant everything to her. Accepting the truth would mean dismantling all of that and deny her of glory and her understanding of the nature of Eldians. Of *course* she wouldn’t accept it at first. This isn’t something that can be dismantled with a talk-no-jutsu, especially with a 12/13 year old who has seen and achieved so much at such a young age. In fact, I think Gabi carried herself very maturely for her age. I’ve seen manchilds in their 20s and 30s who never grow up and live in their own bubble of hatred and extreme violence. I don’t even blame those people—society has never given those people an opportunity in the first place. But Gabi, having front seat tickets to the Eldian-Marleyan conflict, realized the world isn’t so easy and that there are no enemies. Her world was shattered and even now she’s in the process of reconciling with that. The girl’s seen shit. I think her growth is respectable, and I’m glad she was given the opportunity to grow."

AmroTheLegend,NenBE4ST,honestly that place is kinda disturbing.
AmroTheLegend,BLZNWZRD,"Holy shit, not only is that place real, but its although SEETHING with hatred to an imaginary 12 year old war orphan. 

All of that said, fuck that dusty child. They should have pushed her ass out of the airship as soon as they were over the ocean. Shoulda hit her with the Lady Une flex from Gundam Wing. Pushed her out then shot her."

LosMichalos,Altarior,I KNEW someone would make this! So happy to see it.
LosMichalos,Main-Double,If it wasn’t on your snap story did it really happen
LosMichalos,seanthedragonborn,"The ""Bad Eldians"" of Paradis had stop ruling over and oppressing the world a hundred years ago. As of today, Marley is the one that is ruling over and oppressing the world, using the ""Good Eldians"" like Gabi."
LosMichalos,AdAdditional7271,"Gabi is actually correct. Ask King Fritz. Years of rape and genocide were in fact, committed by the Eldian empire."
AdAdditional7271,SilverWingsJS,"But why did Kaya and her mother pay the price?

And for how long will Paradis need to pay?"
LosMichalos,None,I hate Gabi so fuckin much
LosMichalos,jordansimon,This episode made me hate her more
LosMichalos,Uschak,"On the other hand, everything Gabi says is right. Eldians can thanks Karl Fritz and his ideology so he deleted a memory of everyone insise walls."
LosMichalos,None,"Here is the thing.  In real history there are very few if any “good guy” nations.  Did Eldia do all of this? Probably.  Did Marley do all of their BS? Also probably.  That’s why it’s a cycle of violence.  I could go on all day about power corruption.  

I believe the overall lesson is you shouldn’t punish children for the sins of their fathers.  It takes one major group standing up and saying no to break the cycle, then their decedents are charged with maintaining the new cycle.

I also think deep down The Writer is an absurdist and thinks no matter what the cycle will repeat, Titans or no, because it’s in human nature."
None,LosMichalos,Yeah I think that's the message
LosMichalos,None,"I just feel so so bad for Gabi. Literally brainwashed since birth, treated like garbage and made into a child soldier and then, to top it off, watched Eren and crew destroy her home, kill her friends and destroy any hope she had of becoming ‘normal’. She’s also 11 so like, of course she’s annoying and full of rage but man I just feel bad for her"
LosMichalos,None,Lmao gottem
LosMichalos,Kayjuku,I feel like there was a scene kind of similar to this scene  in another show I can’t remember what though
LosMichalos,punx3030,That girl reminds me of Ymir
punx3030,LosMichalos,Yeah she looks similar
LosMichalos,Geometryck,"man do people not realize the point of this all was to show gabi slowly undoing the marleyan brainwashing? is it her fault that she as taught from birth that she had to redeem herself for the sins of her ancestors? this is exactly what most brainwashed 12-year-olds would say. ""hating"" gabi for this scene is dumb. this was not a ""gotcha"" moment, this was about showing the two children's different perspectives, one of which is a product of faulty logic and propaganda. let's not forget that gabi was an eldian too, raised in a family where this was routinely drilled into her head. **you can dislike her character, but to act like she's the oppressor and not another victim here is just plain stupid.**"
LosMichalos,DoubbleD_UnicornChop,She killed Sasha and took my only humor....
LosMichalos,ilikespookystories,My homies also hate her. But i can't feel that way about her knowing what she went through. She's just a brainwashed kid fighting for what she thinks is right. She's misguided but later on she gets her redemption.
LosMichalos,Ruach_Shadow,i didn't dislike Gabi too much but then this gets animated and oh my this hits harder than in manga. I am a certified Gabi hater now
LosMichalos,downtimeredditor,Not only that but what the fuck was marley doing now
LosMichalos,CrimsonReaper2,Damn. This meme roasts Gabi hard. Thank you good sir for roasting the twat.

LosMichalos,GOLDOWEEDO,**lmao get nae nae'd**
LosMichalos,-ShiNKi-,"Gabi thought they were right because she just believed what people told her

She didn't see what the Eldians did, she didn't see how Paradis people were suffering, she knows nothing like many of those stupid marleyans.

Now she can see how the world she lives in really is, thanks to Eren's actions.

They have to face death and destruction to finally understand what they're doing is wrong."
LosMichalos,DedicatedToTheCervix,"Gabi is the Africa to Kaya's Europe.
It's great to see stuff like that discussed on a popular manga/anime."
LosMichalos,GlamorousMoose,"Ugh, cant even stand Gabi"
LosMichalos,koeseer,"Gabi is also an Eldian.

She blamed her ancestor's action for what happened to her and her kin in Marleyan territory."
LosMichalos,door_to_nowhere_,Gabi is an interesting character because of how brainwashed she has been. Her entire world view is being shattered and she can't process it.
LosMichalos,Drisurk,They did a good job making her annoying as hell. Can’t wait to see anime only reactions after the BS pulls of decapitating Eren and then shooting the Titan to save Armin from Falco’s back
LosMichalos,OranNee,She is the most hypocritical character I've ever seen in anything and I just cannot believe how well pulled off and understandable it is.
LosMichalos,hansnakeman,Gabi is a bitch
LosMichalos,No-Seaweed-4456,Titanfolk is gonna love this one
LosMichalos,FewCranberry1767,"I am an avid AOT fan and I appreciate all the complex and dynamic characters Isayama had wrote but Gabi...... she just gets under my skin like no other anime character has ever had. 

I know she is supposed to “mirror” Eren but she is just sooooo fucking irritable and it does not help that she killed one of my fave characters. Idk she just takes the cake as “most unlikable character” (for now) in my book. I legit had to pause and take a deep breathe watching this episode because of her “outbursts”.

Like jesus christ 😫"
LosMichalos,Trisket5,God this sub is so cringe... didnt realize you were all in middle school.
Trisket5,BRUHYEAH,"No nuance here. Apparently nobody here caught on with the parallels between Eren and Gabi, or at least don't understand that Gabi has been severely indoctrinated and later learns that she's been stupid.

For a sub dedicated to the manga, it's almost like a bunch of people here haven't actually read the manga..."
LosMichalos,None,Worst written character in the entire series. Literally the show would be no different without anything unique to her.
None,nemoTheKid,What? Gabi’s character is so important and so well done. She’s the female Eren - Eren was just as much as an edgelord as Gabi and so great to see what that kind of behavior spirals into.
None,alishebl05,"Love her or hate her, c’mon man, she’s really well-written."
alishebl05,beppegrosso97,"She IS, especially later on in the story. I don't get why you're getting downvoted.

What's more people seem to not be able to distinguish an unlikeable character from a poorly written one smh"
LosMichalos,AaronEagarlol,Kaya destroying Gabi with facts and logic...lmao.
LosMichalos,TheRagingGamer_O,"Can't stand a scene with this dumbass in it.  Show definitely would be better off without this trash sub plot with the kids.

LosMichalos,crimsonpaths,She's so fkn annoying
LosMichalos,None,"This episode made me hate Gabi more, how can character be so ignorant and so one dimensional. Kaya really put some sense into her thick skull"
LosMichalos,Plastic_Performance2,"A lot like blm ""We were slaves and were held down! We should punish the white man!""

""But we did't do anything, only some of our ancestors.""

""Well we should still punish you!""

that don't make no sense"
LosMichalos,Gabzy12,Gabi >>> Eren
LosMichalos,Annual-Temperature-2,"I wanted her to say ""you're wrong."" With the most emotionless face ever but that wouldn't make sense.. 😔"
Annual-Temperature-2,berthototototo,Kaya would be wrong in that case considering everything Gabi said turned out to be exactly right. Minus the part about holding current Paradis Eldians accountable
LosMichalos,69th_Herrscher,"gabitch trash o' gabitch trash please fucking die already~

Yams kill this bitch trash pretty please?"
LosMichalos,infernoseph26,I like gabi's character arc so much. The way she slowly starts to realize how the propaganda she's been fed her whole life is wrong and then really want to atone for her behavior later on is why she's one of my favorite characters. I totally get anime only watchers hating her now but I hope they grow to like her later

LosMichalos,icemichael-,this didn't happen in the manga...
LosMichalos,s_a_s_a_n_k,I started AOT on Monday last week and completed till the last chapter on Friday but the hate for Gabi is never ending for me and I didn't hated any character in the anime verse more than her
LosMichalos,bod3flick3r,Gabi is being hated on for this as if she's wrong? lol
bod3flick3r,tylerray1997,But that's the whole point no one is in the right anymore they made that pretty clear. They are both doing what they BELIEVE to be the right thing.
bod3flick3r,None,If Gabi isn’t wrong then neither is Eren.
None,CaptainBoomerang1,That was pretty clear
bod3flick3r,10messiFH,even if what's gabi saying is true it's still very wrong to use it in that context. when kaya pressed harder on her she had no answer and was left speechless
LosMichalos,ThomazAc3,"Not to be on Gabi side but she is right, but the descendants do not deserve to suffer because of past crimes"
ThomazAc3,Geek2DaBeat,"Like Marleyans aren't also abusing the titan powers for their own goals?

Neither the old eldian empire nor Marley are correct in any way with how they treated the world around them and Eldians, but instead of understanding that, the world needed a devil to pour all their hate into

Its an endless cycle of ""you started it"""
Geek2DaBeat,ThomazAc3,"I think i shoud have been more clear, to me both are wrong, both Marley and Eldia did horrible shit but the new generation should not pay for past crimes"
ThomazAc3,chi-han,"To me, I think the point is that they're both right and they're both wrong. Descendants of those who perpetuated horrific crimes do not deserve punishment, but the establishment of those crimes must take responsibility and make things right (which hasnt been happening which is what has fueled the cycle of violence and hate). I don't think Isayama will take an opportunity to explicitly demonstrate it but I'm sude he implicitly wants to push forward the idea of reparations not revenge. At least that's what I get out of it."

huysolo,berthototototo,"People don't realise that if you do the technique of illustrating a double standard to point out someone's hypocrisy, your stance can't be that you believe in the argument they disagree with, and disagree with the argument they agree with.

H-K_47,quangngoc2807,"This is how i understand the ending: 

Ymir loved King Fritz despite how horrendous he was as a person. That's why she continued to maintain the titan power for her descendants through the paths after she died. But deep down she wanted to break free from this curse of love although she didnt know if she could do so. 

That's why she needed Mikasa, the woman who is the same as her in regard to having a passionate love for a man. She wanted to see if Mikasa, despite her passionate love for Eren (the man who committed a terrible massacre), will be able to kill him to protect the world. She probably thought that if Mikasa could do it then she, too, would be able to stop following King Fritz's wish and release humanity from the titan powers. Then she somehow controlled the paths so that it will lead to this result. 
 
The only question is that was Eren controlled by her or not? Or did he saw the ending and willingly followed her guidance?
 
Oh, and also that Historia situation that didnt add anything to the story. Now that's really questionable."
quangngoc2807,Kaiserigen,You are genius. Eren mind was fucked up after seeing past-future and himself doing shit in time
quangngoc2807,bunny-cookie,"Thank you I couldn’t make sense out of that, this helped"
quangngoc2807,GentlemanWukong,I just can't wrap my head around thinking how could ymir-karl and mikasa-eren stories be similiar. I can't think anything other than this is just a big retcon
quangngoc2807,morte_ao_estado,"Pretty much, it was all just a loli x old bastard mindbreak hentai. I wonder what Isayama meant with this."
quangngoc2807,LonelyAsgardian,"I interpreted it somewhat the same way too; with Ymir’s “love” basically meaning her sacrificing her freedom to maintain her devotion to Fritz despite his horrid nature but Mikasa using her freedom to kill Eren while also choosing to love him and remember him acting as the catalyst to free Ymir, to show her that love doesn’t mean the loss of freedom, in fact it is one of the greatest possible uses of a person’s freedom. And that’s why she found it in her to leave the mortal plane forever and relinquish her control and influence on the Titan curse. 

I still feel yams needed 10-15 more pages to flesh it all out and make every plot element land well enough, but for the most part, I’m satisfied with this ending. Hopefully the anime fleshes out some of this stuff better and maybe expands a bit on some aspects. The one thing I’m perhaps the most sore about is Historia being sidelined to such an extent that almost everyone led themselves into thinking she has a big payoff only for it to be nothing but her character being sidelined, and her child only having thematic importance to the coda of the story."
H-K_47,Stick124,"An ending for those who were exempt in this chapter:  
&nbsp;  
* Yelena and Kiyomi are still having boat sex to this day  
* Farmer Kun created a machine that could generate power for Paradis, using the tears of all the fans that expected Eren to be the father.  
* Rico would clean up all the rubble from the walls until she died of old age.  
* Ymir would make Sandcastles with Ramzi in Paths for eternity.  
*Bertholdt Ended up being Armin's Personal ghost-friend that only he could see. Most people would assume Armin had just gone insane from helping killing his Dommy Husbando.

Watched the Rodtisserie attack Orvud, the Queen's coronation, the RTS battle, the serum crisis. I was SHOOK when we slowly watched the basement reveals play out over the months. The sudden timeskip DESTROYED me. The Marley cast. Anticipating the old gang to show up any second now. The Tyburs and the Festival and the insane basement talk leading to the Declaration of War. All the post-timeskip designs. The deaths. The violence. The confusion and the division. The chaos. The Paths chapters. The Rumbling. Then the final arc. And now we're here, at the end.

Four long years of waiting for S2. I remember watching the opening for the first time and falling in love with Sasageyo immediately. Then more and more. They hype building throughout S3P2. Then the studio change and Mappa S4 leading to now.

H-K_47,MikeRoz,"Eren admitting in a moment of weakness that he doesn't want to die or be forgotten doesn't really bother me. It's something we've seen time and time again in this series, with badasses succumbing to terror and despair at the end. Nanaba cried out for her daddy, Bert tried to beg the people he just tried to massacre for mercy. Even Erwin the gigachad admitted he didn't give a shit about saving humanity, he just wanted to see what was in the basement and see his dad's theories proven true. Didn't stop him from moving forward, and, seeing that this conversation is in a flashback, it didn't stop Eren either.

What bothers me about this ending is that I'm left unsure that the people driving the plot have any agency at all.

While Eren says he'd have tried to flatten the Earth regardless of what he saw in his future memories, he can't explain why he'd want to do that. He also says that his thoughts are incoherent. He both planned to set up the Avengers as saviors of humanity and to wipe out humanity? What?

So maybe Eren's a slave to his future memories or to Ymir, but surely Ymir must have a goal she's committed to, right? Nope, she loves the original Fritz who enslaved her so much that she follows his will for 2,000 years, but she also has selected Mikasa to free her from having to do what she's choosing to do? And at some point after many, many generations, she replaces her original imperitave from the original Fritz with Karl's Vow to Renounce War? All while compelled by love to follow the original Fritz's will and while looking forward to being freed by Mikasa? WHAT?!

Both of these people supposedly drive the story. In Eren's case, he drives the entire post-timeskip plot, and Ymir drives the plot of the whole series. Yet I can't ascribe a coherent motivation to either of them."

H-K_47,leavejayvlone,Easily the most polarizing chapter. Holy shit
H-K_47,Skyclad__Observer,"I could write no shortage of reasons why this chapter was dumb as hell, but here are a few of the things that stood out to me as *particularly* dumb:

* Nothing achieved - So everyone thinks Eren is the coolest guy for committing global omnicide. (Can I just add how tone-deaf it is to have Armin thank Eren for becoming a mass murderer)
Armin still wants to solve everyone's problems by talking things out, meaning he really hasn't developed at all in this final arc. Mikasa's life still seems to revolve entirely around Eren. Paradis is full-on Yeagerist now, and war is still inevitable. This is straight up just the outcome of the 50 year plan. Paradis and the world are just on a more level playing field. Really? The ending makes it clear that Eren's genocide is the only reason Paradis is still around at the moment, so truthfully this does nothing to convey that genocide wasn't the solution. If Isayama was comfortable enough with genocide solving all these problems, then why couldn't Eren succeed again? 

* Simp Eren - This came out of absolutely nowhere. His breakdown about wanting Mikasa never to move on and wanting to live happily ever after uwu was absolutely embarrassing to witness. There's nothing wrong with Eren showing emotion or breaking down, but this is worse than fanfiction. In a decade of publication the only instance of of Eren doing anything towards Mikasa that could even remotely be considered romantic was wrapping a scarf around her, but now in the eleventh hour I'm just supposed to buy that he committed global omnicide because Mikasa gave her the wrong answer in 123? And he just breaks down crying like a little bitch wishing she wouldn't move on? Seriously? I mean shit, I'm a pretty big EH guy, but I could have accepted Eren reciprocating some feelings for Mikasa if he treated it in literally any other way.

* Eren killing Carla - Something I was a proponent of, handled absolutely atrociously. It's just lightly brought up and breezed over like it's not a big deal, when a twist like that could have been the focus of a full 45 pages. The whole point of Eren making a decision like that would be to highlight his drive to move forward, and yet it's totally at odds with everything else in the chapter. You mean the tell me *the* event that kicked off absolutely all of Eren's pain and suffering is just briefly mentioned, like it didn't even really matter? Horrendous. For him to get Carla killed and then sort of just shrug off the rumbling as something he doesn't even know *why* he wanted makes him seem like a psychopath. There was no reason for this twist if Eren wasn't fully committed to carrying all the way through with the rumbling.

* Everyone lives - 138 was more or less retroactively ruined with this. Jean and Connie saying goodbye was really only there for cheap shock factor. The final battle had no important deaths, unless you count Zeke, who was voluntarily killed. Even the warrior families come back like nothing happened. Why did Isayama waste time having everyone transform at the fort if it was immediately going to be undone just like that? Imagine how much more impactful it would have been if the shifters actually sacrificed themselves to bring people back, like Reiner or Pieck dying for Gabi to return. Remember when Reiner reminded Falco about their promise to protect Gabi? Well apparently Isayama didn't.

* Ymir Fritz & Worm - Absolutely no closure. I really firmly believe all Isayama had to do for this chapter was to give Eren and Ymir proper send-offs, and he failed on both fronts. Ymir just... vanishes, without a trace. Turns out the culmination of her character was just that she loved her abuser, and she was waiting 2000 years for Mikasa. Really? All that for a wattpad tier conclusion about seeing Mikasa kiss Eren's decapitated head and deciding that was good enough for her? And what about the worm? It literally just vanishes off-screen. Reiner went from the second main character of the story to the group's worm wrestler, and the worm just, poof, disappears by itself anyways. The final battle didn't need to devolve into a battle against a fucking worm if it didn't matter at all in the end anyways."
Skyclad__Observer,LordLoko,"I agree with almost every point, but especially.

Not to mention Hallucigenia-san, another useless waste of panels. 
It suddenly appears, does pretty much nothing but exist and basically dies offscreen two chapters after being actually introduced.

H-K_47,Slaiden_IV,"Will the world really forget and forgive the Eldians for wiping out 80% of the population. I mean only a few Eldian soldiers were part of the alliance to kill Eren, but most of Paradis was okay with The Rumbling. Eren says they won't be able to attack, but remember these are the people who have held a grudge for over 2000 years. They already hate Eldians and now you are telling me that having 80% of them wiped out will make Paradis safe in the long term?

The more logical future is that all the people will still hold grudges against Eldians (who were honestly Okay with the genocide) and raise their kids to hate Eldians and once they are back up on their feet, the cycle repeats.

Which makes Eren's whole plan pointless."
H-K_47,Blackmesa560,"Like what was the point of Zeke's plan if Eren can take away the power of the titans? And how is 80% of the world population gone if they barely made it to the hangers of planes in Marley. Is 80% of Marley's population gone. Also the millions of Colossal titans wouldn't they be reverted? The people of Marley wanted to engage on the Eldians but wouldn't they be severely outnumbered? 

The paneling of Historia giving birth and Eren massacring the Marleyans just doesn't make sense. If Historia was bearing Eren's child the panel would be the father bring destruction while the mother is birthing life. But if Eren and Historia are completely unrelated the scene falls flat. 

The Eren/Mikasa relationship is never framed as romantic or never hinted it from Eren's side so out of nowhere it's weird. I've seen him be protective but not this...

Also what was the purpose of Ymir's character? Somebody give me some clarification.

People are memeing Eren killing his own mom as fucked up as it is I think it was justified. At this point Eren's morality is so skewed that any action resulting in a more positive future makes a little sense. Eren diverted Dina from Bertholdt in order for Armin to inherit the Colossal Titan. Armin later being the hero and helping negotiating with surviving Marlyans was the purpose of Carla's death. It's a bit shallow but assuming Eren saw all possible futures and saw leaving Armin in this world state was the best possible move then it makes sense. Beyond this future its impossible for Eren to see because he's dead. I mean it does parallel when Eren speaks that Armin was  the one the would save everyone when they had to choose Erwin vs. Armin. But still why not kill everyone? What purpose does the rest of the world have? Eren with his Attack Titan can see every reaction to any action he can take for his remaining lifespan assuming he doesn't transfer the Attack Titan so was this the best outcome? It was was this or Willy's war."
H-K_47,2rio2,"I know there's a lot of disappointed people, but holy shit can I say how ballsy this ending is.

**Eren Yeager's life is a full on Greek Tragedy.** He might have one of the most tragic stories of any protagonist I've ever read. And it's all based on the core of any 101 dramatic class - drama arises from the human heart in conflict with itself. 

Eren seeks, above all, to be free of walls and limitations. He hates those who would trap him in walls and restrict his freedom. It's why he hated the Titans, even before they killed his mother. It's why he sought to join the Survey Corps, who represented humanity's desire to be free, even before his home city was attacked. 

And it's precisely this desire to be free which ultimately kills his spirit, then his body, after he is trapped by a greater force than his own free will - the crushing, unyielding, inevitably of fate. This is activated in Ch 89 once Eren sees his future memories. At this point Eren, who truly believe the most important thing was to be born into this world and pushing his own will forward, knew he was destined to brutally massacre and kill millions of people. Worse, as time passed it became clearer and clearer he could do nothing to stop it. Not because he *didn't want to* stop it, but because he knew his own nature and saw it coming that it would be inevitable based on his own outlook of the world. **It's essentially like watching your future self commit genocide, be horrified, then grow more numb as you realized this is who you always were and always would be.**

So you have Eren full in conflict within himself through the story, both at the horror of what he will do and finally acceptance of who he is. And all of it is consistent, because it's all in the name of his stated goal to be free, and make the people of Paradis free. 

In the end I recommend everyone re-read Ch 69 as Kenny and Uri nailed it right then. We're all a slave to something. Eren, ironically, was a slave to delivering freedom to his people by destroying half the world. This is a far darker take to me than him just murdering the entire planet and rolling back to Historia. This is stating something deeply troubling about our own human nature, and how the things that drive us, the things we love, are often the things that destroy us. 

It wasn't the ending I predicted, or even the one I really wanted, but I think it's brilliant and devastating in it's own way."

It feels like the conversation about who would be the ""next"" Founder titan and the conversations about turning Historia into a titan deeply affected him. He didn't want anyone else to suffer from the power of the titans, and did everything he could to end that power once and for all. Even if it meant killing billions.

H-K_47,SaltMaybe,"Now that I have finished this chapter, I’d like to say that the ending was nothing like anything that I could’ve thought of. Was it bad? No, probably not (in my opinion). I think that now that I have gone through the seven stages of grief, I can actually accept this ending. What comes to mind is Kenny’s quote about everyone being drunk on something, and I think it’s directly connected to the ending. Eren was drunk on freedom, and this is him sobering up. Overall, this chapter was certainly the end of the series, and I really enjoyed the story that Isayama wanted to tell."
H-K_47,agoldenfool,"i’ve been trying to make sense of the ending for some hours now, i was kind of expecting this outcome (eren playing the villain bla bla bla) but there is still stuff that i can’t even begin to think to like. 

first, i hate that it was eren who sent dina to carla. of all the things that isayama could explain (hallu-chan?) he decided to go with the “how come dina didn’t eat bert?”. i mean, who cares? we were okay with dina simply chasing grisha and looking for him, as she promised, why did carla had to die at the hand of her only son? and in the last eren’s pov chapter he’s asking himself “what would mom think?”. i bet she thinks you’re an idiot, bb

and i can’t even wrap my mind around ymir’s love for king fritz. yeah, stockholm syndrome, all right, but it was never even hinted that she loved him. she cried and we saw her eyes for the first time when eren told her she wasn’t a slave, she freed the pigs because she longed for freedom, she didn’t have enough will to live to heal herself and don’t die on her daughters and the man she “loved”... i mean, come on. that was just shallow and awful."
H-K_47,None,"The Eren/Dina/Bertholdt/Carla thing makes more sense when you think of it as Eren needing to drive Dina away from Berthold (as was necessary for the fixed timeline), but that also meant that Carla would die by her as was set in stone. The scene isn't about Eren wanting to kill her mother, it's about Eren wanting to save Berthold at that specific point, which in turn leads to Carla's death. 













Eren wants to save someone but that only leads to him losing someone. That's part of his character. No matter how much he wanted to try to rebel against the flow of reality for his freedom, he just couldn't do so and was forced to suffer from being a slave to the predetermined path that he was set onto. He himself could never change the world the way he wanted. Hence The conclusion of his character arc was giving up on his freedom and dying for the sake of the freedom of others. It also fits more in Erwin's line about dying while entrusting your comrades to find the meaning of your own life. Not the kind of character arc you may have wanted from Eren, but one that I can't help but adore."
H-K_47,rubbie,"I've criticized this chapter enough on here (and there's plenty to say), let's talk about the positives !

**Things I liked about this ending**

- The concept of Eren and Armin Paths-travelling through ""lands of ice"", ""rivers of fire"", etc was an incredibly satisfying pay-off to their original conversation in Ch. 4. I wish the actual dialogue made more sense, but the idea itself was brilliant, especially beginning where it all started (Shiganshina), going to the ocean again and finally the Rumbling, as the characters themselves grow up. Great visuals.

- Levi saluting to the SC ghosts was both quite cliché (my first thought was *Return Of The Jedi*) and extremely satisfying imo. A great scene for me

- Muller finally having his Kitz Weilman moment, I'd been waiting for that for quite some time now. I like how it showed that Marleyans didn't trust the Eldians still, even though it was mere build-up for a classic Armin turn.

- Gabi and Falco babysitting Levi is peak fiction

- Mikasa going back to the Chapter 1 tree is also amazing, I always wanted Eren to [rest peacefully](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lsfi5u/if_you_had_to_choose_a_way_to_die_for_eren_what/goqwcvn/) under that tree and I'm glad I got it. Feels like the story going full circle, and I'm all here for it.

- Eren = bird? I love the idea, loved it since 130-131, and been a fervent proponent of the ""Eren reincarnates into a bird"" theory (and any kind of bird-related theory in general). I really like the way it was done here, ambiguous, pretty poetic, it doesn't really make sense or follow any logic but it does work here beautifully. SnK is a story about freedom and the bird scene is the perfect conclusion to that imo (I do wish the rest of the chapter worked better in that regard)"

To see it end like this is disappointing as it had the most potential out of all of them."
H-K_47,SweetCoconut,"Just finished reading the official typesets for the third and last time and honestly... I'm feeling cathartic right now. For the past three days or so, I've been feeling excited and stressed because of the leaks, the fake leaks, and the actual leaks (so much so that I forgot to be actually productive LOL). Now that I witnessed the ending, I'm relieved to see the ending.

I followed this series for nine years and got the chance to see everything slowly reveal. It was a great experience and I never regret following this monthly instead of binge-reading. Even though I was mostly a casual reader, I consider this manga as one of my all-time favorites. But well, the ending is something that I'll not be fond of.

On the bright side, I'm happy that this ending showed hope for everyone. I loved Levi's farewell to the Survey Corps, its so good. The FG moment is also so good (best ship). There are so many things that I dislike and can't accept, but I'll just keep moving forward (unlike Eren lol). But I'm honestly tired man. I browsed through this subreddit, the other SNK subreddits, twitter, fb and /snk/ for the past few days that I just need a breather. I just think that this ending is another case of shounen manga endings that divided everyone and will continue to be divisive in future discussions. Watch another popular shounen manga years later that will have a divisive ending and everyone will say: SNK's ending is better than this! And I'm sure that it will happen lol.

But I'm glad that I got to witness, rage, shout, cry and many more with TF. This sub may be called a lot of names, but I truly loved my time here. Love all the memes, theories, analysis, parallels and fanarts. Special shoutout to based u/FuckYeahPhotography for creating Big Floch. I sincerely think you should write a novel and you're based. Always.

H-K_47,None,"I liked it better when the whole thing that Ymir was waiting for was Eren coming to free her from her chains and destroy the world.

If that were the case, as it has already been shown to be in previous chapters, removing the Power of the Titans from the world makes no fucking sense. Eren is constantly pushing for freedom, and giving up the very weapons that sets Paradis apart from the rest of the world makes absolutely zero sense. It's a level of pussiness that is practically on-par with Eren just letting the Paradisians die out completely without having a chance to defend themselves from the world. Now all of a sudden Mikasa is what Ymir was waiting for, and now that the Power of the Titans is suddenly gone, the world still hates Paradis anyway? Like what?

AoT is tragic, and I would have loved if everybody that got turned into Titans stayed that way. What's the point of having Jean and Connie's goodbye if they just get turned back into humans anyway? For fuck's sake, it's the last chapter. That's the best time to kill off important characters!

H-K_47,Porko_Galliard,"Why did Eren do a Lelouch ending when he literally rejected that at the beginning of the series? Why not do the 50 Year Plan when his half-Rumbling basically accomplished the same thing but worse? He insisted he didn't want to leave Paradis to fate but then just made everything worse.

How did Eren's motivations for the Rumbling go from ""fighting for freedom"" to ""idk I just wanted to kill people"" to ""Mikasa didn't love me (despite me never expressing feelings like this before)"". And what an embarrassment that scene was. Despite his whole character arc being overcoming feelings of inadequacy, learning that he had to fight to live and that he didn't want to die because he was born into this world (Reiss cave scene anyone?), he just has a temper tantrum about Mikasa and decides he doesn't deserve to live? Since when has gaining Mikasa's affections (which he already had) ever been a priority for Eren in this manga? Reminds me of Zeke changing up his entire life philosophy in like four pages. And was Isayama just memeing with the dove? The final panel was all just a ruse?

Why did Hallucigenia die? What was the point of titanizing everyone for cheap drama? Why did shifters come back to stop Eren and why was Grisha flip-flopping on his goals? Why did Eren not have Dina eat Bert? What the fuck was up with Ymir? Eren basically just said ""eh, I don't know, she's weird"" (that explanation with her Stockholm Syndrome was just bizarre).

Why is everyone all buddy-buddy now? After Eren literally just killed 80% of the world (more than the fucking Black Death), Armin is just smiling at feathers and going ""we'll talk it out! They'll love us!"" Reiner is sniffing letters. Levi is being wheeled around by Gabi. Warriors get to live happily with their families (Karina Braun gets off scot free for being a horrible human being). Just... what?

I liked that Isayama didn't do a peaceful ending copout (at least acknowledged that Paradis would still have to fight), and I liked that the Titan Curse ended (the story would feel incomplete without that resolution). But that's about it. 

It's not even that I needed a Rumbling ending. I didn't expect Isayama to be able to wrap up all the complicated details in just one chapter, but I just wanted *some* resolution that actually made sense with the plot and character arcs we had rather than completely contradicting them. :/"

Didn’t Isayama right this story backwards? So in all the amazing parallels and foreshadowing why didn’t he foreshadow the single most important thing... that Eren loves Mikasa back.

H-K_47,harsheye,"After rereading it with the proper translations, it's not THAT bad. It's just that Isayama's execution wasn't that great. So many plot points were left out, like the Hizuru nation and Mikasa's relation, The Hallucegenia (where did it even go????)

The Eren going on about how he wants to live with Mikasa panel didn't really seem as bad as everyone says here; let's not forget their point of discussion at that moment was Eren being a bitch to Mikasa and Armin has ALWAYS been good at getting Eren to voice out his true intentions, and Eren clearly got overwhelmed blurted that out, to which Armin says ""didn't expect you to say something this pathetic""; Point being, I think this when animated would be FUNNY af. But the main highlight here is that Eren cares about her and does want her to be happy. 

The whole Ymir being in love with her abuser was poorly done. We could have gotten more panels or a few more chapters talking about maybe the toxicity and how Ymir didn't know what LOVE was. And then say that Mikasa showed her what love is and showed her that you can love someone and at the same time MOVE ON. Infact, I wouldn't have minded if they made it about her attachment to her children instead of the King. 

What I didn't like was all of the blame low-key being put on Mikasa. It all depended on Mikas- REALLY??? Eren gaslighted her, told her he hates her, and just messed her up emotionally for this rumbling and THEN hearing him say ""Oh, it was all about Mikasa's choice."" Like, that's just pathetic, lmao

I feel if there's anything that can truly save this ending and still respect the author's work, it's Mappa adding in extra episodes and scenes, or maybe OVAs with Isayama's input to make it make sense. I don't mind an anime original ending, but I'm too afraid theres a possibility of it becoming even worse."
H-K_47,hook25,"The thing that bothers me about Erens break down is that we know he can stretch time in paths, he can live a 1000 lifetimes with Mikasa and his friends, he can explore the entire world, what the hell is he crying about?.

Maybe he feels he doesn't deserve that because all the killing.

Then what about those memories with mikasa in the cabin?.

Only ymir knows.

Speaking of ymir...  Her motivation was to make a world ruled by titans as king fritz desired but she was about to make all eldians infertile thus ending the world rule by titans by zeke's command. This is some mass effect 3 reaper logic right here. 

Only ymir knows."

H-K_47,None,I must admit I don't really understand how Isayama's original vision of the final panel has anything close to the same feeling as Eren reincarnating as a bird.
H-K_47,BioLizard18,"Ever since Eren ""died"" in Trost, we've known that Mikasa would live on for the sake of remembering Eren. Even in a world without him, she'll still have him and their bond in her thoughts.  


Eren was misguided in trying to convince her to ""move on"" from him. She was never going to move on or let go of him - just as he couldn't do that for her either. Instead, he should've focused on spending their time together and creating more memories and good times.  


Seeing him break down over the fact was so sad. To me, this is an utterly tragic love story."
H-K_47,doctor_awful,"This ending was ridiculous.

""My friends, I managed to rid the world of nuclear weapons""

""Well gee doctor\_awful, how did you do that?""

""Oh I used them and killed everyone! But you survived maybe, so you get the credit for stopping me! And nothing else has fundamentally changed. Also, I knew about all of this all along, and created the conditions for it even happening""

You think about it more than two minutes and it just gets dumber"

H-K_47,Commercial_Step_8922,"We overanalyzed Eren and this story a bit too much. Eren literally said it... He wanted his friends too live a very long life at the expense of the world.

That's it."
H-K_47,Kuwago,"Ok since Isayama forgot to explain what happened to Ymir and the Titans then I’ll just explain it myself: 

Zeke said Ymir continues to exist via Paths because of her attachment to the living world and because of human nature’s fear of death, obtaining the power of a god she used it to escape death and lives eternally via Paths but her continued existence leads only to more suffering for her.

She’s like a lost soul wandering in Purgatory, unable to accept death and continue to cling to the living world.

But in doing so she continually suffers, in Buddhist terms, it’s Samsara the Wheel of Suffering. Every desire is ultimately a desire for liberation, but nothing in the living world can give true liberation because the world is Maya (illusory). In order to achieve Moksha (liberation) one must rid oneself of desires and attachments and in Ymir’s case it's her attachment to the memory of King Fritz and of the living world is what’s holding her back from true liberation.

Now that Ymir saw in Mikasa and Eren that letting go is also part of true love, she chose to disappear from the world, removed the Paths and all Titan powers, freed Eldians from their curse, reverted those who were turned into Titans back into human form and ultimately freed herself from her suffering."
H-K_47,Fair_Industry7328,"I can't help but think this is an elaborate, long-game troll.

It feels like Isayama started writing the manga with the intention of weaving an intricate and compelling story, only to ruin it at the end.

I refuse to believe a writer so intelligent would shit the bed right at the finish line *unintentionally.*"
H-K_47,None,So basically Eren had secret conversations with everyone in paths but then erased their memories of it and they would only remember once he had died?
H-K_47,itsallfuckingtaken,"It’s not that I can’t accept the ending but the dialogues were truly unlike AOT. Armin thanking Eren for being a mass murder and the alliance justifying what he did is unacceptable to me. I wanted them to hold Eren accountable for what he did even if he had no other options or whatever. 

The whole plot points that made this last arc so interesting had no real meaning behind them. I don’t even understand them tbh. If Ymir knew Mikasa would be the one to save her why did it have to involve genocide? Maybe I’m just dumb but I really don’t get it.

What about Historia’s role? What was the point of her getting pregnant ? It really feels like everything was meaningless. 

I still love the series and I’ll always treasure my experience with it, and I do thank Isayama for creating such a complex story even tho I can’t really wrap my head around the ending."
H-K_47,penguins2946,"Tbh I feel like what really hurt this ending is that Ymir wasn't fleshed out enough as a real villain pulling the strings. I feel like this ending could have been a lot more widely accepted had Ymir been fleshed out more, but instead it's ""idk she loved King Fritz"" and ""idk she wanted Mikasa to save her"". 

Like sure, we got Ymir's background, but I feel like we never really got to know her as a character and that really hurt the ending. If we had a better understanding of Ymir, and fully realized that Eren was just a slave to the path Ymir set him on, I feel like this would have been received a lot better. Instead, we got like 1 chapter over a year ago for how she got the power of the titans and that's really it."
H-K_47,rvtots33,"I will post it here again

This is from r/manga

u/conopidaucigasa said If he could make Dina ignore Benito Hooverini back in Shiganshina why didn't he just let her eat him? Dina eats Boruto, becomes a Shifter, Grisha can now use the Founder because Dina is a Royal. Paradis wins. Yay?"
H-K_47,Mrtheliger,"One more thing, Grisha telling Eren he's free? Literally the funniest part of this monstrosity."
H-K_47,obxsguy,"The better translations really cleared it up and maybe it's not as terrible as I initially thought, but damn did Yams make some strange and (imo) terrible decisions for the ending. I think the worst has to be the whole situation with Ymir, not even mentioning the love thing with Karl Fritz but because of how her whole plot line just doesn't get resolved at all. Just ""oh Mikasa will do something I guess"" and that's it lol. I know the whole reincarnation as Hisu's child were just hopeful fan theories, but wouldn't it have been such a nicer ending to her story? Doesn't even have to be Eren's kid, just let her get born again in a new world where she's free. 

Also wtf happened to hallucigenia? If it living was tied to Eren living (because apparently it fucking thanos snapped as soon as Eren died), then was the point of having it at all? The same ending could've been achieved if it never even existed in the first place lol, it was literally pointless. Eren could've farted instead and turned everyone into titans because he knew in the end they would kill him and revert. Would still be the same. 

Also, I guess Hange, Shadis and Magath died for nothing. Floch was used and discarded like garbage for a cause that even Eren didn't believe in. 

I could go on about other stuff but plenty's been mentioned in this thread and I don't wanna write an essay here. The ending didn't suck imo but it was so underwhelming to me lol. Guess it's time to look forward to S4 P2 now. 😐"

Its not completely different, but the lines make much more sense and its much more coherent to me. I dont think its a bad ending, its not the 1000IQ 4D chess 30 minute youtube prediction ending everyone thought, so its simplicity is definitely pissing off a lot of people. A lot of stuff was properly foreshadowed and lines up logically (Bert not being eaten, Eren asking “what are we” to Mikasa in Liberio) Its gonna be awhile for me to truly digest this ending, but im not gonna sit on how I personally thought it SHOULD have ended, because stories should never be viewed through that lens.

It would've been better if it ended at chapter 145 or 150 instead of ending it a chapter 139 because an ending like this one IMHO needs to be in the oven for a bit longer and developed perfectly to make sense but cramming all that info for one chapter to wrap it up doomed this chapter from the start. I could go on and on pointing out what I don't like about this chapter but the community has it covered. The best moments for that chapter were the Levi, Gabi, Falco, and Onyankopon scenes for me because I thought they got a happy ending and that the Survey Corps' sacrifices were not in vain. I didn't mind the Lelouch ending but that shit needed more time. Might as well add that Levi is the MPV for the chapter despite him resting for a good portion of the chapter.  And of course, WHO KNEW A MEME ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING PART OF THE ENDING.
Ellen became dove (and we're crying)
Overall this series is a good 7/10. Perfect story, meh ending that needed time. I could've said this chapter is the worst but 137 already beat it For. This chapter was confusing to say at least. I would've just take 138 as the true ending but for now, it's time to move on. SUSUME!"
H-K_47,Foxbayk,"About Eren not wanting Mikasa to move forward

If you think about it , Armin and Eren's conversation about Eren not wanting Mikasa to move forward with her life took place in ch 131, but then afterwards in ch 138 , it was probably Eren who sent Mikasa the Aaron Yogurt dream/AU, where after he dies, he tells her to forget about him, which means in the end, Eren actually wanted the best for Mikasa, that she should forget about him and move on with her life"

Pieck: Wait he brought you to a cabin too?

Annie: Yes! You too?!!!

H-K_47,SavannahWithAnH,"Does anyone else get the feeling that Eren was NEVER free? I feel like his entire life amounted to being a pawn of Ymir and the Attack Titan. That's probably why he was so hell-bent on freedom, he was constantly under the influence of the Attack Titan and deep down he wanted to be released from it. Now that I think about it, Mikasa probably freed him when she killed him. Really Tragic. To be clear, this isn't a complaint by any means. I'm mostly just wondering if anyone has other thoughts about Eren's obsession with freedom."

It would have been more “poetic” for her going through all of her scape(even killing some eldians and marleyans) and fulfill her last wish of coming home back to her papa no matter what before the rumbling arriving there, have a little cute daughter- father time and eventually die fighting the inevitable (the rumbling) with her dad.

Instead we got her living peacefully with her dad and armin after mass murdering eldians and them forgiving her.

Our gurl Hange got a nonsense death instead."
H-K_47,killinrin,"I’m obviously upset with Eren’s final characterization, but Ymir being in love with that sick king is just...fucking awful. And her finding similarities from her story with how Mikasa feels towards Eren is seriously just sick. It’s an abusive relationship x1000. Unbelievable."
H-K_47,chicoisking,"Yeah this ending was not only incoherent but it felt super weak thematically. The main theme of the series, freedom, was hardly even that present in this chapter. The peace felt rushed and the love stuff felt out of place. Nothing really sticks out to you and it feels forced.

Ymir was dealt with off screen when she was built up to be very important. Historia baby was anticlimactic. Nothing makes sense....

In reality his most secret and selfish desire was to be with her and not die. He swears Armin to secrecy on this and yet despite never saying it directly to Mikasa, she knows. She never gets rid of the scarf, and in fact tightens it to stop Eren. She loves Eren and knows he returns the feelings too. 3 years later she is still thinking about him and wearing the scarf.

Despite neither of them ever directly admitting it to the other, they both know. It's really sad and beautiful. And I think it's very wonderful in how deep their love for each other runs. While sparse and only occasionally hinted at, the few romantic moments between them tend to be incredibly deep and tender."

on a different note, i was very impressed with isayama’s evolution as an artist! when i found the first chapter, i legitimately spent around 20 minutes trying to figure out if i was reading a fan-drawn depiction due to the style being so much different than the anime screencaps i’d seen and the manga panels my sister had shown me. he did so well growing as an artist, and i’m proud of him for that. plus dealing with the shit from fans that he’s gotten for the ending. must be grueling.

not really expecting this to be seen but i thought i’d put it out there. i’m impressed by isayama, the ending was flawed but enjoyable, and seeing theories and fan reactions make it even better. sorry that this isn’t coherent, i have a wicked cold."
H-K_47,None," Ok, I am going to be honest in my thoughts so it is going to be **long** and **scathing**. Please ignore this comment if you cannot handle me criticizing a **fictional work**.

The way Ymir received her conclusion was incredibly jarring especially with how much emphasis she was given from her appearances in 122, 131, 133, 135, 137, and 138. The relationship between her and Eren was hinted to be important given how the titles of Chapter 1 and Chapter 122 were complementary, indicating a connection stretching over 2000 years. And yet she simply disappears without a proper send off in the final chapter.

The Hallucigenia creature literally disappears despite functioning independently of Eren and Ymir without a single appearance after the focus it received the previous chapter. I expected Reiner and Falco to do something about it since Falco's promise to Reiner about saving Gabi was literally brought up 3 chapters ago (136) but they did jackshit in regards to the detitanization. It was all Mikasa--she freed both Ymir AND ended the Hallucigenia **off-screen**.

Reiner's treatment has been atrocious. He was listed as one of the five key players in the final battle alongside Eren (whose treatment I'll get to later), Mikasa (killed Eren and ended the Titan curse by freeing Ymir and killing Hallucigenia), Armin (stopped the Rumbling), and Levi (killed Zeke and thus stopped the Rumbling). He has done almost nothing of note in the final battle--even Jean had a bigger role by blowing up the nape of Eren's Titan. And Reiner simping after Historia came totally out of the left field. The Reiner-Pieck-Jean conversation is one of the worst things to ever happen.

I don't even want to get to Eren right now."
H-K_47,-Alh,"Well I re-read it again, this time after cooling off my head a bit and this time I actually read it and actually I find it way better and maybe even a good/decent ending, also it was sad as fuck. My ""little"" opinion about it:

Eren: We all knew that Eren didn't enjoy neither the rumbling nor what was happening with his friends, but to see him this chapther really made me feel sad for him; after kissing Historia's hand he had to witness how he became responsible of his mother (I hated this, but I knew it ever since I saw that ""shard"" of Eren seeing Berthold throught Dina's eyes) and even his father's death, the death of 80% of the world and had to accept the fact that he could never be actually free thanks to Ymir and the AT, he literally goes insane but he still managed to acomplish some of his goals and despite everything finds a little freedom chosing to save his friends.

\- He rumbled the world at 80% and only stopped because he was stopped, otherwise he would have killed the 100%.

\- Even if the 20% is still alive, it doesn't mean that this 20% is actually one place in the world that was left intact, it may very well some scattered countries around the globe or even just people that managed to escape the rumbling.

\- Put the ball on Paradys field; the end of the manga is the alliance coming on behalf of the 20% of the world seeking peace with Paradys, that in 3 years managed to become a military power, not the other way around, as a matter of fact Annie is afraid that Historia might actually kill them.

\-Paradys arming itself isn't a bad thing, I'm from Chile and since our country armed up we haven't had any kind of external military conflict, it is sad, but it is how it is.

\-He unified Paradys under the Yeagerist flag, however history has proved that nationalism is never a good thing.

\-He managed to protect Historia, now she has a family she seems to love and has become the real ruler of the island. She is living the life she choose to do just like she choose to have a baby instead of running or choose to support Eren despite everything. Finally, the Reiss tradition of passing down titans is over.

\-He did what he said he was going to do from the very begging, ending the titans.

\-His friends are all alive and well and are probably going to live long and peaceful lifes, war isn't happening anytime soon. RIP Hange and Sasha tho.

&#x200B;

Also take on mind, Eren became Chad Eren only because he saw Historia's and his father's memories, at the end of the day he was the same teen we last see before RtS and even that is sad, because at this point everything was working well for him.

&#x200B;

I do agree however that the execution of this chapter was bad or felt rushed and I believe that maybe they could have cut some of the Alliance or worm bullshit to make it better, 1 more chap could have easily fixed this.

I didn't like how Ymir's plot got resolved, It was obvious that Ymir had something for that shitty monster because at the end of the day she choose to follow him, kill people for him, build him an empire, diying fom him, push his will for 2000 years and was also paying attention to that couple in love, but it could have been executed better, Mikasa freeing is okay for me as well and the reason for Eren's ""only Ymir knows"" its obvious because this is before the alliance vs Eren and it seems he can't see how the thing will play out at the end.

Regarding EMA, I love how at the end he had an honest talk with Armin and could at least see a glimpse of the places he wanted to see and that he trusted the future to him, he venting about Mikasa is sad but at the end of the day his real last words to her were to move on with her life. Honestly some people find it cringe, but I liked, I loved seeing Eren being a human and a teen again and wanting to have selfish desires, like traveling with Armin or living with Mikasa. About EM, I'm not sure, we all knew that Mikasa was one if not the most important person in Eren's life simply looking at the memory-shards panels or how she was the last person he went before starting his master plan in the hopes that she could give him another answer. Maybe he did fall in love with her after getting over his jealousy of Mikasa being better at everything than him during S3 but the whole rumbling thing got in the way. I mean, his facade almost fell over after Armin called him and slave and that his only freedom was to hurt Mikasa. I only wish this was also executed better, I can totally understand that it felt weird Eren having this burst when he has been an asshole to Mikasa for most of the time.

&#x200B;

At the end, I liked this chapter and I feel really sad for Eren and Mikasa (I understand why Eren's VA said he cried), I totally understand why some people hated this ending so much so if you didn't like it I'm not going to call you dumb or anything (taste is subjective matter), I mean it literally nuked EH and AnR out of existence and that was the flag theory for a lot of people, specially here, however I feel like most of it's problems comes from the fact that was poorly executed, rushed and had plot holes that were never adressed again, but calling this GOT levels of trahs is bullshit, and this from someone who is a lurker from Freefolk since it's conception and I don't think the ending was retconned by Yams or his editor or anything, it was an amazing story full of twist and I will look foward the anime adaptation in the hopes it can fix some of it issues.

I'm glad I'm not the only one that actually liked the final chap at the end, even in titanfolk, so thanks Yams for the journey!"

What the hell was the last chapter?!
So we follow a grown up Eren RIGHTFULLY changed by his countless battles and by the realization that his dream for freedom for him and his family would come at the cost of billions of people. So he closed himself to his own friends because he wanted to carry this weight alone. It destroyed him, RIGHTFULLY so, but he kept moving forward because for the sake of his people, he was ready to sacrifice the world.
BUT NO!
He killed 80% of the fucking world population just so his shit friends could be regarded as heroes by the rest of the world. WHAT THE FUCK! AND THEN THE ISLAND GETS FUCKING BOMBED!
""BuT tHe CyClE oF vIoLeNcE wOn'T sTo-"" oh yeah, I already fucking knew and so everyone who doesn't have the QI of a fucking mosquito. Show how Eren's action didn't stop the cycle and show the Island nuking ITSELF. NO?
And why the fuck doesn't Eren demolish his fucking ""friends"" with a single thought?! ""But their freedo-"" AND HIS FREEDOM? HEH? WHAT ABOUT IT?! ""If someone tries to take my freedom away...I won't hesitate to take theirs."" RINGS A FUCKING BELL?
Ah no sorry guys apparently he did all because he loved Mikasa as a possible partner and not as a mother as YAMS FUCKING SAID. Totally not retconned. 10/10. Beautiful.
Also I LOVE that Eren killed his mother because reasons, when he could have done literally anything else. ""B-but the course of the event-"" IF DINA ATE BERTHOLD THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE FUCKING FOUNDER AND THE FUCKING *COLOSSAL* OF ROYAL BLOOD.
No it makes perfect sense.
11/10.
Just fucking great.
Eren best character, keep crying you fucking dove, I loved you.

H-K_47,penguins2946,"Honestly after reading the actual typeset, I think this ending was way better than what the leaks wrote it out to be. There were definitely things I didn't like overall and things they really should have clarified/expanded on, but overall I liked the ending and came out satisfied.

Things I liked:

1. I really liked how Eren became a slave to the path Ymir set him on. I love the irony that comes from that.
2. Eren communicating with all of his close friends prior to the battle, and them wiping their memory and restoring it after he was killed, was a good thing to add. I just wish he and Pieck could have talked, but it's not like they knew each other.
3. I like how confused/overwhelmed Eren seemed due to all of the knowledge/memories he had. While he seemed in control earlier in the manga, this really emphasized that he was completely lost and overwhelmed with the power he had with the founder.
4. I also like the addition of Eren saving Bertholdt when they first attacked.
5. I like the conclusion and where the story went after 3 years.

Things I didn't like:

1. The whole thing about Mikasa being the one who freed Ymir. Saying ""I don't know, only Ymir will know"" is a shit explanation for that in my eyes. I can maybe understand why Ymir loved King Fritz from a Stockholm Syndrome POV, but they don't explain how Mikasa ""freed"" her from that or why it had to be her.
2. Tbh I don't like the whole ""wah I don't wanna die I love Mikasa"" stuff from Eren.
3. The entire worm thing just appearing last chapter and disappearing this chapter. It went from Reiner wrestling with it while possibly being overwhelmed to just not even being mentioned this chapter. It would have been better had they shown the POV of Reiner as the power of the titans disappeared, instead of showing Falco crashing into the ground.

I think it's overall a satisfying but disappointing ending. I'm fine with the conclusion but there were things that should have been expanded on."

I can maybe understand why Ymir loved King Fritz from a Stockholm Syndrome POV, but they don’t explain how Mikasa “freed” her from that or why it had to be her.

I think this is because of Mikasa finding the strength to liberate herself from her own enslavement of love. Granted she does still love Eren, but maybe not for the reasons that she once did; not for being genetically engineered to

>	Tbh I don’t like the whole “wah I don’t wanna die I love Mikasa” stuff from Eren.

I can understand disliking this because it’s such a shocking departure in character, but it reads to me like such a natural reaction.

Not because of the wiping out humans outside of Paradis part that's fine and makes sense, I'm talking about what it would do to the ecosystem. Think about it, countless animal and plant species would either go extinct or endangered if there was a full rumbling, the world would be completely barren with nothing there because even some of the small plants like grass would be gone because there burned away from the heat of the Colossal Titan's. The effect this would have on the climate and ecosystem would be terrible, it would take decades before basic plant life would regrow but that doesn't matter to the animals because there's none outside of Paradis left. Not to mention the global warming and drastic cut in oxygen from no plant life and the steam from the colossal Titans warming the world.

H-K_47,christopherous1,"Well my 2 cents here.
TLDR
My interpretation is that Erin was a slave just like everybody else. And in the end he set his loved ones free.
He saved them, but not himself.


In Kenny's words ""All of us are meant to suffer. It is that suffering that drives us to be drunk on something. We are a slave to what makes us suffer.""  
Eren was a slave to freedom. And he suffered for this, no matter how hard he tried no matter how much he suffered he was always a slave just like everyone else.

The point of his story was to set free those he cared about. He can't stop wars and he can't stop the cycle of hatred. 
But he can set free those he loves from what they are slaves to. The world is destroyed so Armin can fulfill his amd Eren's shared dream of discovering the outside world. He freed  Mikasa from her love of him and Ymir from the love that bound her. He also freed all Eldians from the curse of the titans. 

In the end the boy who sought freedom died a slave. But those he cared about lived on free because of him.

This was the path he saw and this is the one he followed. Even at the end when he knew he would never be free. He kept moving forward."
H-K_47,guillaume958,"I  was wondering: Eren had a heart-to-heart with Armin, which was shown  and the others which wasn't shown. I thought it was disappointing that  we didn't see the final heart to heart with Mikasa, but holy shit we did,  didn't we?

H-K_47,ms_103127,"6:09PM EST:  Good evening, titanfolk! :D

Not sure if anyone has already posted about this, but since Eren wasn't completely privy to what was in Ymir's heart/mind, I was curious as to what she might have known overall. I'm guessing that she foresaw two potential outcomes: (1) Mikasa's choice was to spare Eren and allow him to continue with the Rumbling, which would have illustrated the kind of devotional/artificial love that Ymir was accustomed to, and the outcome would have been Eren's survival but a much more tragic ending, or (2) Mikasa's choice would have been revealing her feelings and self to Eren, but in the end, sacrificing her own personal desires for the sake of the greater picture, and killing the only person she loved to achieve that reality.

For me, this is why Ymir smiled.... Mikasa choose the correct and most enlightened path, allowing Ymir to understand that even the most difficult and emotional of choices can be done to not only achieve and restore balance, but to free the very person that you love in the end.

As a consequence of Mikasa's self-sacrifice, Ymir decided that she was free after all, and she took PATHS and any traces of her existence (Hallu-chan/the Coordinate/the Titans) with her into the afterlife."

H-K_47,Stormlord1441,"now that it's over, my favorite character is definitely Levi. one of the best character arcs.

I've become the very thing I hated most... a Levi stan"
H-K_47,Bodinm,"When you reread the last arc knowing Eren's full plan, thoughts and motivations it really becomes a tragedy and connects everything.

You are meant to question whether everything was predetermined or did Eren do all the things he did because of his nature to seek freedom and because he was born that way. This is what Eren meant when he talked to Armin. He meant that he didn't know why is freedom that important to him and why is that his nature, not that he didn't know why he rumbled the world as that was stated clearly at the beginning of chapter.

You also get the reason why he couldn't tell anything about his future memories to his friends and why this outcome was pretty much inevitable. Additional revelation that he actually loved Mikasa and wanted to be with her is necessary to add a final punch to this tragedy. If he told his friends his plan or if he revealed his feelings to Mikasa, that scenery of a world without titans could not be possible because Mikasa would never kill him in those scenarios.

He desperately searched for alternatives that would ensure both his friends and Paradis safety but there were none that could compare to finally ending the curse of the titans. I initially thought that he was selfish for not sharing his future memories since with that information available Paradis could surely think of something better, but last chapter revealed that he couldn't risk compromising the future he saw by doing that without any insurances that the alternatives could work which put him in a check mate position.

This all made him isolated, frustrated and alone. The purpose of his breakdown in the last chapter is to make him human and accentuate his tragedy and sacrifice. It is completely believable and does not make him any less of a character than he was because in the end he did continue moving forward at the expense of his freedom and desires all to make a hopefully better world for his friends. And that is precisely why Armin thanks him - it was because he understood Eren's sacrifice not because he thinks what Eren did was right as he himself says that he will not let this error go to waste.

Have in mind that Eren's last moment was not here but in the previous chapter where he died with a peaceful expression on his face, satisfied that he finally reached that scenery and accomplished everything he wanted to do for his friends. He stayed true to his nature of seeking freedom but left the world in his friends hands which is in a way aligned with the Survey Corps ideals of entrusting the living who follow to give meaning to the actions and lives of those that came before. And there are numerous clues in the last part that confirm that his friends will do just that, that there was hope after all that hell and that Eren's actions were not in vain."

H-K_47,KynoSSJR,"The ending pulled at my heartstrings which I wanted, but some of those panels needed to be other things instead. I just need to rant

Reiner is Erens counterpart from beyond the walls, we saw nothing between them even though he is basically the second protagonist. Instead we see shitty peace treaty negotiations and army prep, WHY THE FUCK DID EREN HAVE TO SUFFER EVERYTHING IF THE WORLD ARE STILL GONNA FIGHT? I was anti rumbling but seeing the outcome the Marley racist fucks deserved it.

Like even after watching everyone transform they have the audacity to point guns at them, good thing this was panelled instead of Eren and Mikasa’s conversation when it is now clear as day after all Erens struggle and agony alone it was Mikasa who saved the word just by loving him.

Erens character wasn’t butchered (completely) imo, I just think we saw the side that was still a little boy that longed freedom and didn’t want to die, since the founder has the past present and future mixed i guess that can be why Eren is so radically different at times.

I think what hurts me the most is the fact that no matter what freedom Eren sought, no matter what decision he made he had no impact if it was Mikasa who had to stop Ymir by teaching her to let go. Mikasa deserves to be the main character if this was the case. 

I knew Eren was going to die in the end and I knew he would end up killing his mother to force himself to seek freedom and take on the world, but it’s a fucking kick in the balls when it was all for nothing. Great morale to the fucking story get fucked destiny is a bitch. At least Kenny chad’s quote came into play in the end.

Also no explanation on ackermans after curse over? Alright. Eren the only fuck in this story who was doing this for everyone else and enduring it all to ensure their future dies. Whilst Annie, Pieck and all the other murders who weren’t doing anything for a bigger picture get to live Scott free. FUCK FUCK FUCK

I still like the ending somewhat but pain"

H-K_47,Mikassaaa,Historia and the baby's plot line is honestly the weakest of the series. Why tease it so much to begin with? Why make it seem like eren being the father was going to happen? Isn't it like a waste of panels if it was all going to be for nothing in the end? Why were eren and historia kind of focused on in the high school AU? Also what was with the mother and baby symbolism in the season 2 opening if nothing ever really happens with the baby? I'm not a shipper at all I'm just genuinely confused

H-K_47,jao3003,Yelena became such a purposeless character that Isayama didn't even bother to give a closure for her. She probably killed herself or is leaving a normal life in Paradis. Such a sad ending for what once was an interesting character.
H-K_47,veinacis,Well... that explains why Eren got so pissed at Armin for calling him a slave. Mfer was an actual slave to his fate which many people said was a foolish thought cause Eren’s “always been free” lol.

H-K_47,Jedi_morelos,"In chapter 131 Eren say he was so disappointed when he found out there was humans on the other side and that HE wanted it to all disappear. And in the new chapter he said he probably would’ve killed everyone regardless even if he didn’t know he’ll be stopped or not, and he said he didn’t know why but he just wanted to, I think that was his ACTUAL pain knowing his idea of “freedom” all his life was never freedom, and that one selfish thought drove him or made it easier when he was killing people on the other side. He was finally “Free” by making his younger dream of not knowing humans on the other side existed pretty much a reality by getting rid of them, therefore explaining why he was young in Ch.131. Now In the final chapter him thinking about the reason why he wanted to flatten the world and leave a blank plain anyway, is one of the last thoughts he had before his name was called and said he was free then died. In a dark way the mass murder was erens real freedom... but it confused him because he was too young for one, and also he was getting his personal and selfish thoughts mixed up with the idea of “that’s what he needed to do to save his friends” , so he just says “he doesn’t know”. Eren was truly confused and suffering most of this story but he is definitely free and at peace now 🕊"

It took me a long time to process these feelings and understand how I really feel about the whole story. although the story wasn't perfect, it has truly impacted me and I wish Eren didn't have to take on the burden that he did."

H-K_47,None,I’m so confused by this chapter like Armin and friends knew Eren started the rumbling for them(and ofc to save paradis) and I’m pretty sure they even acknowledge it but they disagree because he is LITERALLY killing the whole world for them but in this chapter when they get their memories back they’re praising him like wtf? Armin even thanks Eren for being the bad guy and killing so many with the rumbling like isn’t he suppose to be opposed to it. Idk I just think it’s weird how they banded together to stop the rumbling because they disagree with it but in the end it feels like everyone sort of sees it as a necessary evil that Eren HAD to do

Man we literally see the guy asking his kids to eat their mother. The fuck are we supposed to sympathise with the parallels between them and eren.

I love this series too much and it'll always have special place in my heart despite the unsatisfactory ending. Thank you Isayama you've done a great job for 11 years

edit: it's an acclaimed series all over the world so ofc it was going to have an controversial ending but i really hoped some of my questions were answered properly. Eren doing the rumbling because he had to is probably not the best explainition for his actions.

Was the ""final panel"" that was shown actually supposed to be the *final* panel, or was ""final"" misinterpreted/something that just got added in translation? Because technically we did get Grisha holding Eren and saying he's free, but from a different angle from what we were shown."
H-K_47,Lord_Cattington_IV,"I am... Divided. 

I actually do not mind the ending so much, but I do mind the fact that Eren turned into Sasuke. 
Or all the other anime ""good guy villains"" that has done the whole ""I will make the world hate me because only i can carry the weight of such a doom"" cliche spiel. 

I genuinly thought the lesson would be that Eren became obsessed/missguided/turned into a bad guy, and that the ""planned end"" that yams had always worked towards was ""oooh yeah im gonna make the good guy the bad guy, they will never see it comming"" and in some way, nobody saw it comming cause the good thing was that this manga was so nuanced and complex, that the transition wasn't that cliche, and it made sense from the narrative we had been given. 

My gripe was ""do i support Eren my main charakter, or do i realize he is too far gone into his ideology"". But now all that is removed, turns out the good guy was the good guy all along, and not only will his friends enable this attitude, they will THANK HIM for his sacrifice. 

Like for real, thats the cliche 5 year old way to view it, and then the grown up way would be to say ""fuck you Eren, you are crazy and drunk on power, nobody wanted this, fuck your ""sacrifice"" it means nothing to us, now we fight you stupid evil motherfucker"". 

But we didn't follow that path, we didn't get the huge climax or the huge settlement after Erens actions, the moral lesson turned from ""War is bad, and makes good people do crazy/evil shit"" to ""It's all ok for the greater good"". 

And that's a shitty moral."

2.He literally grew up with mikasa and armin, He knows how selfish it is to want Mikasa to only care about him.

However I'm still disappointed with the amount of plotholes and confusion left behind. Why didn't eren just get rid of the titans in the first place? What is the worm? So many questions left unanswered and I feel truely disappointed. 

If this chapter was released after a couple long chapters going more into depth on what eren was thinking and answering many of the questions, than I'd feel satisfied."
H-K_47,BitcoinJesus24,"I can’t shake the overall feeling of the ending just not feeling “right” to me. Not sure if it’s pacing, dialogue, or something else entirely. Some posts on here cleared up a couple plot holes I noticed but even then, something just feels weird about it to me - like the lack of sensing finality with it. Who knows, man."
H-K_47,BambooLord,"Hi everyone,
I was lurking in this sub (and previously the other one...) since the epic 94th chapter release thread. And yes when I saw those leaks/typesets or rather this chapter, I was so disappointet. At first ...

It was a nice ride, now let me explain why I could cop(ium)e with the ending. 

First of all, I think most of you are right, Eren could have done every imaginable shit with the Founder's power. He could have rumbled the world, he could have grounded the alliance and even messed with their memories to forget about it all... and some plotlines were either never explained or used as a plot device (the last points were the disappointing part to me). And the Ymir loveplot is pretty convenient, to say the least.

But:

All of you were desperate for a tragic and 'real' ending. 

Q: Wasn't it the most 'real' ending? 

Let me explain.

Eren simply wasn't a lelouch, a hero, a perfect protagonist or a perfect antagonist. 
He was just a person 'born into this world' (TM). 
He made his point in the flashback after the marley arc: all he wanted was to protect his dearest friends. 
In the end he accomplished that one -except for potato girl :'(.
He was never supposed to save or flatten the world, those were our expectations through endless theories! (And there were a lot of good ones)
Eren was  just someone like you and me, who somehow gained superpowers. But how do you make the best use of them?  Who knows (Eren did not, since he was some random average Joe, the Training Arc made this pretty clear)...

Why did Eren not kill every non-eldian (or rather non-paradisian) with the rumbling? 
I don't know. But as I seid, he isn't perfect. Maybe he didn't want to take their freedom? Idk

What did Eren accomplish in the end? 
Pretty much imo.
He gave all in-universe sides/factions a fair chance to reach our current status quo. Isayama couldn't come up with the solution for world peace, because this solution doesn't exist in our wolrd (or why do we still wage war? Tell us, so we can end this).

Why did Eren leave the aftermath to his friends and just go to hell?
What do you expect? When he kissed Historias hand he saw a f*cked up future, one single timeline, in which everything was trampled, but most of his friends were alive, so why not just pursue that path if you don't know better? As I said earlier, he was just an average guy, perhaps he simply couldn't live with the guilt.

On a side note: 
Eren fulfilled his promise to rid the world of the titans. 
And he gave up everything, his mother, his love, all the years he had in this world and all those trampled souls, for his friends (and Karina wtf)."
H-K_47,DasUngeheuer,"Coming back here to write a comment feels like scribbling on a bathroom stall at this point. Every time I think I moved on from this story I catch myself feeling this ache in my chest. We tell stories to understand our own lives better, we tell them to process difficult situations, we tell them to think about what makes us human, to give ourselves some time to think. It’s fair to say that stories are alive, they are important to us. Storytelling is one of the oldest art forms us humans developed, it’s what connects each of us, doesn’t matter where you come from, what your social status is, you’re a part of this. I love fiction so much. I love thinking about what the motivations of interesting characters are, I love thinking about what the core philosophy of a story is, I love trying to riddle what will happen next. That space between said and unsaid, the mystery surrounding plot points, it’s what keeps me glued to the page. You hear a certain quote and it speaks to you and you don’t even understand why, because it only speaks to something deep inside your subconscious, something clicked, something was able to reach… I'm so sad about this. About the wasted potential. I don't even know what I'm trying to say. It's just a shame. I know I'll get over it and by that I mean I'll forget about this story. I know that because it already happend other times. And I'm sad about it. Infinitely sad."

The only good thing in this chapter is Falbi and uncles Onion chad and Levi but that's still not enough to salvage this chapter for me tbh."
H-K_47,Edwin5302,"Ok I liked Eren showing Armin his plan in the boat, and the birds theory coming true (even if without much explanation).

Also Levi's scene, and the fact that Gabi and Falco take care of him now it's so fucking funny.

Everyone reverting back to titans was expected, would have had more impact if the titanized people remained.

Also nice the callback to Armin's speech in s1.

The only BIG thing that I didn't like this chapter was Eren suddenly confessing that he loves Mikasa, and in such a weird way too. I'm not a shipper, but that really came out if nowhere.

The ending scene with the bird wrapping her scarf was nice though.

It was nice being with y'all for this amazing story, the finale could have been better, but it's not this absolute dumpster as some people make it out to be.

See you when part 2 of the anime airs.
O7"
H-K_47,None,"The reason Ymir and worm were defeated is because they finally came to the realization that they could let go. Ymir was trapped by her love for the king to making Titans forever. When she saw Mikasa, someone as madly in love with her enemy as Ymir was, let go of Eren it showed her that she too could be free. It was Mikasa’s free choice to to kill Eren that ended the Titan line. People pissed about Eren’s progression don’t realize that in reality Eren was the slave to the timeline but was seeking freedom for his loved ones. Like we literally watched Eren go from super wholesome dude through 3 season to absolute dark and wretched man who was depressed always. Ultimately I loved this ending."
H-K_47,None,"Yknow, shit as it is. I turned my brain off and ended up crying. Eren might not be the best main character anymore, or really...Man anyways lets just not talk about Eren as a character.

What happened to characters who don't lie and become a pawn of the story? (Isayama interview)

What happened to the final Tatakae he told Yuji to keep the same energy for in the final chapter? (AOT talk show)

What happened to the theme of ""surpassing the father""? (Comment on leaked panel 2 years ago)

At least the memes are funny, but holy shit is it sad to Follow this series for so long just to have a fanfic Naruto ending..."
H-K_47,None,"I don't hate the idea of this ending, I just feel it's poorly written and suffers from not making Ymir's desires known beforehand. 

I don't think Ymir loving King Fritz and not being able to move on is exactly bad, but dropping that in the final chapter without else seems way too out of place. She was used by Fritz so why would she love him? And I just hope the official typeset doesn't make Eren sound so pathetic; it's again not bad, just extremely poorly written.

But the reality of the world post Titans is kinda perfect. I mean, look at our own world. We had a World War where hundreds of thousands died and nearly 20 years later we went ""yeah, lets fucking do that again!"""
H-K_47,None,Liking Mikasa is one thing but the level of desperation that Eren shows is pretty of out of the left field. He’s incredibly possessive of her to the point where he does not want Mikasa to find another man after he dies but he hated this kind of possessiveness in Mikasa ever since he was a kid and felt suffocated by it.

Eren always went all ""tatakae tatakae"", but he didn't fight back against his supposed destiny (even Armin tells him to find a way). He always talks about freedom, but it the end he's slave to his 'fate' and does nothing to change it. Partially because ""no one wants to die like him"".

H-K_47,shadyhades,"I always wanted this to end with destroying the titan curse; it fit with Eren's goal to eradicate all titans and made the most sense for a peaceful resolution. But not like this. Not through some absurd, convoluted plot about Ymir bound by her love to King Fucking Fritz for 2000 years and Mikasa killing Eren somehow being the key. 

Hell, I ship Eren and Mikasa myself and think this played out worse than most fanfiction. I would be willing to accept Eren's sudden breakdown over his most selfish inner desires HAD SAID DESIRES EVER EVEN BEEN HINTED AT MORE. That one chapter with Eren telling Zeke there was no point thinking about Mikasa with only 4 years left to live doesn't even count with how vague it was, mixed in with the Historia panels. If Isayama wanted to take the EM route this whole time, he could have paved the way infinity better for more emotional impact.

I personally never cared much for the pregnancy subplot and think the fandom is partly to blame for overanalyzing it - what irks me the most is how Ymir's entire storyline and purpose was butchered. Why even reveal that gruesome backstory just to claim that she was in love with her abuser? It contributes nothing to the story and it's themes and is frankly, appalling. Don't even get me started on Hallu-chan; I'll just attest that to lazy writing. 

Oh, and that Dina reveal at the end? ALSO COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. If not for shock value, there's no other reason that had to be thrown in there. Sigh.

The biggest problem with this last arc has been the pacing, lack of exposition and too much focus on the wrong plot points. The biggest problem with this last chapter was its straight up awful dialogue and sudden character developments (everyone is now so grateful to Eren for the genocide he just committed that they nearly died trying to stop??) Just like GoT, the ending itself is not inherently bad, it was just executed terribly and far too rushed to ever make sense."

I just don't think we got anywhere near enough eren time, especially given how long ots been. We didn't get any of the eren historia conversation. I do like erens ""I don't want to die"" moment. That was definitely something that hit me in the feels. His love for mikasa finally becoming Canon. I feel like if this chapter had just been a little longer this could have been a valid ending to me. But tbh it felt like it was over before it even started and when I hit the last page my first thoughts were ""shit, that was all?"".

H-K_47,NekoJubei,Is it me or does anyone feel like with the whole time travel and destiny stuff being intensified in 139 made the entire story feel “scripted”? in a way that everything happened in a scripted way and just makes the series feel kinda watered down. I know the characters still worked their asses off but still... I don’t know how to explain it properly.
H-K_47,TurbTheCurb,"What I liked this chapter:

- armin and eren walking through the different landscapes described in Armin’s  book as they talk. This is going to look so good in the anime

- Levi’s Shinzo wo sasageyo

- Eren buried at the same tree that he and Mikasa were at in chapter 1

- birdren wrapping the scarf around Mikasa

- pieck lives

- gabi suplexes Falco 

- Armin talking down the marleyans the same way he did in the trost arc 

- Alliance members seemed to be friends on the boat

- The tragedy of Eren’s character. Wanting freedom since he was born but later learning that he would never have that freedom. But at least he could get rid of the Titan powers for his friends

What I didn’t like: 

- eren simping for Mikasa. I feel like just by changing the dialogue to be less cringe this could be made a lot better

- Ymir loving king fritz. There’s gotta be a better reason than that, no way she loves that rotten asshole

- worm died too quickly, show Reiner Helos stabbing it or something

- chadren gone, scenes with him will feel less badass knowing that his fate was sealed from the beginning. Make it more clear that he wanted to do the full rumbling, none of that “idk lol” bs



Mixed thoughts:

- everyone detitanizing. It felt like a punch to the gut when I read 138 and feels so fitting for attack on titan that something like that would happen. And jean and Connie’s supposed last words were great. But then everyone is detitanized and it didn’t really matter. On the other hand, I’m glad that the characters survived and the worm was really only introduced a chapter before so it felt kind of cheap that it could even titanize everyone to begin with

- warriors and armin praising eren. I kind of get it but at the same time it feels weird lol"

H-K_47,depressome,"I've just re-read chapter 139 (and now I'm waiting for the additional pages what will be added to the tankobon version), and even though I didn't have the time to say it when it came out roughly a month ago, I was among those who heavily disliked the ending, especially this one final chapter. To be honest, while I don't hate it to the extent that some (in this sub, but also in other parts of the fandom) do, I really agree that it somewhat ruined the story, but personally I don't think the entire final arc (starting from 124) was bad, like many instead believe. In my humble opinion it was perfectly fine at least until chapter 135, with the story truly starting to go downhill only with chapter 136 (the ""Alliance"" members going back to the Founding Titan and choosing to face head on hundreds of Titans without suffering even a single casualty).

But strictly speaking about this chapter, there is plenty to dislike, with the worst things being:

1. Eren being responsible (whether directly or indirectly) for Carla's death, a thing that basically ruins his primary motivation for his actions as a character.
2. The ""Founder Ymir"" **loving** *Karl* Fritz (Isayama really had to name it like the First King of the Walls, huh? Couldn't he come up with some other name? Or maybe he really got confused by the his own lore and merged the two different characters together, who knows...) despite the abuse she was subjected to by him. It completely and utterly **ruins** Ymir's character for me and subsequently makes her motivations completely shallow and uninteresting (I honestly think Isayma only chose to do this to somehow make Mikasa relevant in this final chapter).
3. The ""Hallucigenia"" worm being defeated off-screen and the reconciliation between Marleyans and Eldians being extremely rushed, with the interactions between Muller and the Liberio Eldians hardly being believable. Also for the current state of things between Paradis and the rest of the world, it feels like Isayama wanted to both have his cake and eat it too, so he made the Yeagerists retain control of the island and prepare to continue waging war but at the same time make it seem peace negotiations were behind the corner, in a poor attempt at pleasing all sides of the fandom (but ending up satisfying basically no one except his most vocal sycophants).
4. I won't even get in Eren *maybe* ***(or maybe not,*** **who knows?*****)*** being turned into a bird at the end. It's stupid, there is no precedent in the Titan powers being able to do something like this (the Founder can change the Eldians' biology but birds **AREN'T** Eldians, in fact **they aren't even human**, unless we are expected to believe that this is among the (*poorly defined*) abilities of the Beast Titan), and it's so controversial that fans basically can't even agree if it's true or not (but if it isn't, are we expected to believe that a random bird suddenly approached Mikasa without reason ***and wrapped her scarf around her neck, a thing Eren specifically said he would do***?)

To conclude, **I will now resume writing my post analyzing the historical and mythological inspirations for the AoT manga, and while there is nothing more to predict (since the manga is now finished), I will write two possible alternative endings, attempting to fix what I think Isayama did wrong in his own conclusion, so if you're interested, stay tuned for that.**"

H-K_47,Bodinm,"Some things regarding Ymir's love and Mikasa's choice and how I understood them.

At first hearing that Ymir was in love with Karl Fritz who is basically her abuser sounded just sad to me to put it nicely. But I thought about it a little bit and if you look at it from another perspective it can make sense.

This chapter basically confirmed in some way that Eldians really go to the Paths after their deaths so you can look at her love as not only for Karl Fritz but for all of her descendants that are still in Paths that she didn't want to let go. Karl Fritz was in a twisted way probably a personification of all her attachments to the real world she left behind.  If you look at it this way it sounds better.

Additionally people smack Armin for his talk no jutsu but it felt really strange for Eren to be able to liberate Ymir with just a few words after 2000 years of mental slavery. Eren really freed her then, but she still felt guilty about abandoning her attachments and needed to see Mikasa liberate herself from hers in order to do the same and let go.

Now regarding Mikasa's choice. I think Eren misunderstood that she needs to choose whether to let go of her love for him or not but that is not true. In the end what convinced Ymir to end the titans was precisely that Mikasa refused Eren's request to forget him but still did the right thing and killed him in the end. It showed Ymir that you don't have to give up love in order to let go.

You can let go of someone for the sake of the greater good but continue loving them which showed Ymir that she can free herself without feeling guilty about letting go of the attachments she had."

H-K_47,Dumelsoul,"The start of the chapter was really damn intriguing but then Eren's entire fucking character was completely obliterated. The mood was also really weird; it was weirdly happy considering literally 80% of the planet's population was just murdered horrifically. 

I was also really weirded out by how everyone, upon getting their memories back, suddenly saw Eren as a hero. Okay, so he only murdered 80% of the population rather than 100%. That completely changes everything and now Eren is a decent dude!

I don't completely hate this ending as it had a few nice moments, but holy shit was this a weird way to end the series."
H-K_47,LyannaEugen,"1. Even if this chapter praises Mikasa for the end of titan powers due to her choice, i'll still believe Survey Corps had it's worth. Atleast Levi fought for that.
2. Ymir supporting Eren for genocide only to see if someone (specifically Mikasa) is able to kill their lover because she couldn't do it with the king is fucked up. 
3. Levi's reunion with his dead comrades was emotional for me even if it just had few words.
4. The point to be noted is, it's not the world who is waging the war, it's the yeagerist who is fearing that they are gonna attack. The alliance is coming for peace treaty now. The alliance is most probably exiled. Since Levi, Onyankopon and others are not living in paradis.
5. Eren didn't kill Carla for giving young Eren the motivation, but for keeping Bertholdt safe since the story won't happen if Bertholdt dies. It was an unnecessary addition for shock factor though.
6. I could have been better if Eren's POV was limited to ""I had to for keeping my homeland and friends safe"" and not using ""I don't know but I wanted to"". I just created unwanted mystery to it. Rumbling isn't a joke Eren that you would do because you wanted to. Even if it implied that he is bounded by fate, it won't make sense, because even then you do an action because it was either the best choice or you didn't have any other choice.
7. Eren's confession about not wanting Mikasa to be with any other guy and wanting her to keeping on remembering him for atleast 10 years was stupid, it was making me angry and as well as I cannot stop my laughter the number of times I see that panel. It does humanise him but a simple ""I love Mikasa, I wanted to spend my life with her and I don't want her to forget me"" could have done the deal (Yes, I know even my version is cringe at the best, but even that humanises the character lol). Eren, though being a 19-year old was always involved in military discussion and executed a full scale rumbling. The people of the story are way more matured according to the age. So ""Eren's a 19 year old boy"" isn't an argument.
8.  Though the chapter wasn't the best, the story was good, the ending was good."

H-K_47,TheBloodyAugust,"Ymir couldn't break away from Fritz's will because she loved him. Meanwhile Mikasa and Eren had a ""truly pure love."" The theory goes that if Mikasa could say no to that love, it would empower Ymir to do the same. Thus Eren made himself truly irredeemable. Mikasa killing him despite their love allowed Ymir to give up on living for Fritz and let the titans die. Mikasa and Eren were forced to finish what Ymir and Fritz started"
H-K_47,Onion-with-layers,"Oh wow they really straight up went with the Tokyo Ghoul Re ending, no wonder everyone’s mad. If we ignore a few pages it might actually be bearable, that panel of Aaron being all clingy really came out of nowhere. But at least we finally got an end of all the toxic ship wars, and our man Armin won, handholding action and everything. Waifus are temporary, Poundtown is forever. 

And of course we have to make the best of what we got, no matter how disappointing or cliche it is. Yeah Eren felt a little too Lelouch and PRIDE IF Subaru in the end, but it has that little freedom twist to keep the idea fresh, but I definitely don’t want to see this type of ending in a another story for a long time.

H-K_47,ThIs__NaME_iS__TAkEn,"Well I guess this is it, I guess things have finally come to an end.

I don’t even know how to start this, I feel so hollow after reading 139. My main problem with the ending is that, after seeing the characters having concrete resolutions in the previous chapters and all of their development go down the drain felt kinda unpleasant (like eren saying he despised mikasa for 138 chapters straight and then reveal he loved her all along was a very bittersweet moment and it just made my heart ache because on one hand I really wanted them to live a happy life afterwards, but I also wanted eren to keep moving forward). I guess a part of me wanted all the characters to live happily ever after, then again a part of me knew that such an ending would be impossible in the SNK universe after all we’ve been through. Also I feel as if the part with ymir loving king fritz felt forced too much, I mean the guy was as cruel as it gets. The loose ends this ending leaves are also not that few, for instance the fact that true peace still hasn’t been established despite the losses suffered is pretty depressing to say the least.

Anyways, Isayama sensei does not deserve the hate he’s getting, after all we would not have this masterpiece without him. I would truly love to thank him from the bottom of my heart for the rollercoaster of a ride he gave us for 11 years. SNK is not a mere story but an emotion.

The fact that I discovered AoT communities on Reddit just recently saddens me to no end. I wish I could’ve spent some more time discussing all the chapters with you all, but I guess this is what destiny had in store for me.

Anyways, if anyone would like to talk more about this work of art please message me, because it’s next to impossible to explain all my pent up thoughts in a single comment and also because none of my friends watch AoT and I would really love to discuss it with someone 😔

H-K_47,jnf005,"I think the chapter will feel better if Eren doesn't have the power to contorl titan of the past. 

Bertholdt getting ignore is not that big of a plot point anyway, It's much more interesting if it's because of Dina's feeling for Grisha, still seeking him after her titanization. It also makes nearly eveything Eren's fault for his non action if he is in control of every titan, and If the flow of time is set in the SnK universe so he can't change anything afterward, wtf is the point?? 

Introducing this kind of power at the very end are usually the writer copping out, but doing it here is literally pointless, not only that it didn't help the story to end or explain anything important, it makes the story before it worse.(""Only Ymir knows"" is not that good of a cop out too)

It also bothered me that Yam obviously can write good time traveling plot by looking at Zeke and Eren's memory adventure, and he delivered this for the series final moment.

But one of the main things keeping me going was my will to see this whole thing through. If I won, I'd live to see the end. If I lost, I'd die never knowing it. So I fought and fought, and this is my victory. This is what this ending really means to me.

And to all the fans who passed away before this day, I say this: This is what you devoted you hearts to. Rest easy, my friends; our fight is finally over."

“Or,” Mikasa pondered. “They just forget stuff like that.”

“By the way who killed your boyfriend?”

“Oh that was me.”

“WHAT!?” exclaimed the dragon.

“That’s a part of my character arc you dumbass dragon. It wasn’t because I liked it. What was your character arc?”

The dragon thought for a moment. “Guess they forgot that too...”

“Oh...”

The two walked in silence.

“By the way,” said Mikasa after a while. “ Can I ride you?”

The dragon winked. “Ooh, got horny seeing a dragon? Not surprised from a girl carrying her brothers dead head.”

“No, I meant can you give me a ride back home?”

“Yeah sure, climb on lady. Mommas dead anyway.”

Mikasa got on top of the dragon. And that’s how she reached Paradis quickly."

H-K_47,ReversalRain,"Dang, I've been a reader since 2014 and this is going to be quite long, I have a lot of thoughts and questions (spoiler warnings):I don't really get the point of the rumbling still, surely there would've been better ways? To my understanding: I know Armin was absolutely horrified finding out the casualty rate was 80% (the artwork of his facial expression was pretty intense with the stylistic messy lines) and he was strongly opposed to the rumbling. However, he knew that it was out of his power to undo what Eren had already done so he decided to move forward and make the most out of the situation? Yet, it seems like the story tries to justify the mass murder. Eren was a slave the whole time and couldn't think coherently, and the rumbling was part of Ymir's will too. Mikasa was needed to convince Ymir to stop it and lift the curse. Eren's character seems to be a contradictory paradox, he's supposedly fighting for his freedom but becomes enslaved to destiny while doing so, and is the least free character throughout the story. Overall, it is ironic that freedom was illustrated as Eren's main value, yet he and Mikasa are the two main characters that had to sacrifice their freedom for their friends on Paradis to live a long and happy life. I think it is implied that Mikasa won't ever truly move on from Eren's death, based on the bird that comes to wrap the scarf around her (a resolution . I'm not sure what exactly his goal is and I know other people have probably expressed the same things.

Anyway the series kind of reminds me of some science fiction movies, specifically Arrival and Interstellar which are two of my favorites. However, writing stories with time loop elements are always tricky because events cause themselves, and it's difficult to come up with a meaningful reason for why those events happen and turning them into more than just a cool plot element. While I thoroughly enjoyed the meticulous planning and writing in earlier chapters that built up quite nicely, I do think the ending seemed rushed. I wish Isayama could've split it up into two chapters and given us something more concrete, my feelings on this ending are pretty mixed. Since the story is named after Eren's titan, it makes sense that it ends when Eren's part of the story is complete, and resolves the arc of the Eren-Mikasa-Armin trio that we started with. I'm not upset about the rest of the characters' endings being open ended, since it is realistic that after a huge war, social problems such as racism/ discrimination/ hate won't end and further action/diplomacy is needed to keep the world at peace. It would also be boring to continue the story and only write about that, since peace isn't even something we humans have attained in real life. I still dont understand why Eren claimed the rumbling was done for the people he cared about, yet because of him so many of the people he swore to protect had to die (ex: Hanji, Sasha, Floch but I hate Floch) which again, contradicts his purpose. Seems to me that the rumbling was added as a plot element to give AOT a dramatic epic ending, but hard to justify and quite unnecessary. These are just my opinions and you are free to disagree with them or offer a different viewpoint.

Also I don't know where Ymir loving King Fritz came from, but I guess it makes sense it was true because she had all the power she wanted to break free from him, yet she chose to stay under his control? Must parallel the situations in which a victim stays loyal to their abuser, but what kind of leverage did the King have over her, their children together? Did she keep hoping he would one day change?

I see a lot of people absolutely shitting on the ending which is understandable, I'm hoping that the weird/out of place lines are all a mistranslation. After about 8 years of reading I want this ending to really be a complete wrap but there are so many unanswered questions and lack of clarity. I appreciate what we got though. Then again, most endings are like this (unfortunately) and I can't really think of examples of stories with satisfying endings. Maybe Adventure Time had the most prominent satisfying ending I've witnessed in media.   


Since a lot of you are dissatisfied with the ending that Isayama gave, what do you think would've been a better resolution to the story?   


**Edits:** after a long shower I have some more thoughts to lay out which aren't really significant, but I remembered a small parallel between AOT and the Studio Ghibli movie, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (movie spoilers following). The world in the movie has gargantuan insects which were capable of ravaging the world (similar to titans). While I don't remember all the details of the movie, I do recall that one ethnic group/nation used a wounded baby insect (called an Ohm) to lure an entire army of giant Ohms into the valley in order to eradicate the main character's nation. This reminded me very much of the rumbling/genocide in AOT's finale, and perhaps Isayama drew inspiration from this classic movie? In Nausicaa, however, the genocide was averted and the insects and humans were able to live in peace at the end because the main character was meant to be a savior by prophecy/destiny, and calmed down the horde of Ohms to leave. I wonder if Attack on Titan could've had an alternate pathway to avoid the genocide and convince Eren/Ymir to stop, because it was certainly possible to go the pacifist route in other forms of fiction. Armin's character was all about learning to communicate and understand the enemy, rather than dehumanizing them, and I was disappointed that Armin's pacifism principles weren't paramount in the end. It did however, work in terms of uniting the Marley-Paradis alliance and I was very happy in the previous chapters that the two sides began to understand each other and forgive, since that was an important established theme throughout the story. (Ex: Marco's last words were lamenting why Reiner had to resort to violence instead of communicating when his identity as the armored titan was compromised, and when the alliance sat around the campfire they regretted why neither side had sought to communicate.)"
H-K_47,enemyweeb,"The main thing I’m having trouble with understanding is why Eren was like “why I destroyed the world? Idk felt like it” 

Yams could have made him say ANYTHING else and it would have been more satisfactory."
H-K_47,SpectralLettuce,"A sloppy end in my opinion, considering how the hard hitting reveals during the run of the manga were some of my favourite parts. On the other hand the visuals are still great, I especially liked the panel with Eren and Armin among the titan footprints"

It’s been one hell of a journey boys but all good things must come to an end 


armin and eren conversation at the beginning was really good and learning why ymir did what she did for 2000 years 

I think in their situation everyone would be ok with 80% of the population dying to set up things for a new beginning 

gabi and falco looking clean as fuck honestly everyone looks good in that 3 year timeskip but I got really depressed seeing the final panel overall I am satisfied with how the story turned out

H-K_47,juanmamarin00,"I don't think I've seen anyone mentioning it, but I think the thing that Mikasa did that only Ymir knew the reason is the following:

Ymir was deeply in love with King Fritz, she was his slave and couldn't rebel against him.
I'm not gonna say Mikasa was in love with Eren but she definitely had a connection with him due to her Ackermann blood. By fighting Eren and ultimately killing him, Mikasa did what Ymir couldn't do, rebel against someone they defended and protected as if they were a god."
H-K_47,greenpluma,"I don't want to overreact but I also can't accept the ending right now. Maybe after a few reads...

As someone who commented here and a lot of us may be feeling right now, the Isayama that wrote godlike chapters, really wrote this one right here???? I CANNOT. 

But yeah, I'm not mad. I'm also not in love with the ending. I wanna find a common ground where I don't see my love for this amazing manga goes to shit. Maybe from now on when I recommend this manga, I will say, it's reaaaally good but don't expect too much with the final chapter. 

I wasn't really feeling chapters 137 and 138 and I didn't *expect* anything with 139. But still... I'm disappointed. Immensely. I avoided the leaks and spoilers hoping that maybe it's not as bad as they say.

•The Colossal Titans? 

•Dina eating Carla(ugh)

•""Thanks for being the mass murderer for our sake""??????!!!!! (I will wait for official translation)

•Historia getting pregnant for nothing?

You can add the things that frustrates you too XD And also if you can enlighten me especially with Ymir choosing Mikasa, is it because Mikasa has the power to breakfree from the man that she chooses to love and continues to love? Did Ymir wanted to see that and did it result with her ending the Eldian curse(them turning into titans)?

We are actually led to believe the opposite. The only purpose this reveal serves is to draw parallels to mikassa and provide a solution for the insurmountable problem that is the curse of the titans. It’s an asspull out of no where used to to solve the main problem of the story and chalked up to “only Ymir knows”. Deus ex machina (n): an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation, especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel. I think it checks all these boxes which sucks cuz Isayama has such a good story going and the most important reveal to the ending is a cop out."

Armin: ""Where are you going?""

Mikasa: ""Just to go bury Eren under that tree he likes.""

H-K_47,iLikeCheapBeers,"After reading the typeset I'm a lot happier with the ending. It felt rushed, but I like the message that enemies and allies can break the cycle of hate. And, just like in real life, there is no real answer to hate/war so the series ending open ended is a nice choice because it allows for debate. But my two main issues are Eren and Ymir.

&#x200B;

1.) If Eren had been fully committed to the rumbling it would have been better. ""I don't know why, but I wanted too at any cost"" is such a cop out.  A panel of Eren explaining that he did it to end titans forever and free Paradis, knowing that he wouldn't get to experience it would fit his character and be bittersweet. He could break down about not getting to live with his friends, show remorse for his actions, feel sad for all the people that had to die, but still believe that is was all for the greater good (something like Erwin's speech in Shiganshina). But instead we get him getting jealous over Mikasa's hypothetical boyfriend. 

2.) If it was Ymir's love for the Fritz/Reiss family, and not King Fritz, it would would have made so much more sense. She lost her first family to war and experienced so much harm. But she gained 3 daughters that she would want to protect at all costs, even going as far as taking a spear for their abusive father because his death would cause more war. Then, spending 2,000 years protecting your daughters and their decedents would be much easier to accept that a mute girl with Stockholm syndrome. And it would be a good parallel to Mikasa: They both accept that even though they love their family, in order to help those they love they need to cut them off.

&#x200B;

IDK maybe I'm still high off copium but even with its flaws I still don't think the ending is as bad as GOT."
H-K_47,assessmentdeterred,"I think a lot of people are focusing on periphery criticisms about Eren being a simp for Mikasa or a Code Geass ending being a cop-out. But ultimately none of those are the problem, because aspects of this ending are compelling when you consider them in isolation. The problem is that not of it is convincing. 

The idea that Eren is controlled by his destiny, that he was imprisoned by the attack titan from the moment he gained it. That he lost all agency and sense of linearity is compelling. But we're not given any real depiction of the external force controlling him. We're told, not shown.

As others have pointed out, we have no real understanding of Ymir's aims, nor why Mikasa's actions convince her to abandon them. She's kind of an ambiguous force, and Eren seems to be coordinating with her until suddenly he's not and all of his actions are actually about the steps necessary to appeal to her immense power. We're told that Mikasa's actions convince her, but we're not shown any reason to consider that a satisfying end to Ymir's arc. 

As far as Mikasa and Eren go, I have no problem with the plot decision for them to love each other and tragically never reconcile that love. A lot of criticism is being directed at Eren's breakdown about Mikasa, and I think that moment is meant to be played as a twist. Yams misread the mood on that I think, holding the cards about Eren's feelings too close to his chest, so when we finally get a confession of sorts it comes out of left field. The way it's delivered is also very uncharacteristic. I think the intent was to demonstrate the extent to which Eren was forced to sacrifice his desired. But because we've had basically zero indication of romantic feelings, it's a bit tonally dissonant. 

I will say, I'm not looking forward to how toxic this fandom is going to be. Isayama owes y'all nothing. Take the story for what it is, enjoy the good parts and discuss why you don't like the bad parts rationally. Don't threaten lives or harass. It's a story."
H-K_47,None,"If new Isayama wrote the Return to Shiganshina arc:

Erwin: I DONT WANT TO DIE LEVI!!!! I DONT WANT TO SEE YOU UNDER THE COMMAND OF ANOTHER MAN!!!"
H-K_47,RokiSmiles,"I keep saying I’m leaving but I keep coming back lmao 

I hate the first half of this chapter... which sucks because Armin and Eren are two of my favorites but they were both butchered here. 

The second half is... eh. There are elements I like:

- Levi’s scene (I think it was a good send off for his character, I would have preferred him dying in a blaze of glory but this is nice, too)

- Gabi bodying Falco made me laugh and I found it cute, also OLDER FALBI

- #HITCH IS ALIVE AND WELL ON PARADIS

- The open ending on wether or not war is on the horizon 

- I thought the finale scene with Mikasa was okay... I think I would have liked it more if it weren’t for the first half of the chapter. (And no, I’m not EM)



But then, that’s all tainted by the first half, Like-

- Eren’s weird shit with Mikasa and saying he wants her to love him and not find anyone else even after he’s dead??

- *Armin* thanking Eren for committing genocide??

- everyone coming back with little to no explanation (would have preferred it just to be Gabi and it only happens because she eats Reiner)

- the abysmal handling and semi-romanticism of Stockholm syndrome with the whole Ymir/Fritz thing... and then comparing that to Eren and Mikasa in a positive way??

- What happened with Hallu-Chan??

- I don’t get the P A T H S memory shit at all... like- ?? I get the boat part, but Eren and Armin as kids? Was that visions or was that real?

- also Eren killing his own mom and it only being two panels is annoying af

Edit: forgot to mention the handling of poor Historia’s character... what a waste :/

All in all... the ending for me is a 5/10 but a *low* 5/10

The story over all is probably about a 7/10... but only because it was my first anime/manga series and I am, self-admittedly, bias."
H-K_47,None,"EDIT: seems like what I wrote below is based on slightly early/inaccurate translations of the korean scans. Will update after dinner; the most recent typeset chapter clarifies a few concerns I raised below. 

Gonna copy/paste from my recent thread about how this could have been done better...

I’ve typed out a few, I’ll add more and change based on people’s thoughts. 

-	For example, if Dina’s Titan consumed Bertholdt and reverted back to Dina, maybe there was no path forward that would end up saving Paradis (think Dr. Strange)
-	Eren manipulating Dina to eat his mother in front of him would only be possible with the coordinate (Ymir’s power), so he wouldn’t have known this during his conversation with Reiner. If it was explained that when he kissed Historia’s hand, he just saw some memories of future events but not literally everything + his own actions, this could make sense.
-	I can’t believe someone theorized this... https://reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/koudut/memory_shards130_theory/
-	Fleshing out the whole Historia thing is really important. Idk why this wasn’t done. I can understand why he told Historia his plans, as the reason he convinced her to have a child was to delay Zeke’s plan until Eren could execute his. Why she chose farmer-kun is important, as there was so much bait regarding EH that he purposefully put in the manga, so explaining this as reasoning as well imo is necessary.
-	Maybe Eren thought of Historia when zeke was talking to him about family/loved ones because Eren was thinking about how he wanted to have (but couldn’t) a family with Mikasa?
-	Undoing 138 chapters of content and turning AoT into a 2000 year old love story between King Fritz and Ymir is the biggest bullshit ever. Tbh idk if any amount of backstory or explaining could ever make this plot point good writing. You can’t just randomly throw this in, even if Stockholm Syndrome is a real thing. If he explained it as Mikasa’s love for Eren parallels to Ymir’s hate of King Fritz and their descendants, and by Mikasa letting go of Eren by killing him, Ymir was able to let go of her hate and end the Curse of the Titans on Eldians could make sense, but again, we’d need a pretty lengthy explanation of this, and not have it off-screen’d.
-	I think people labeling Eren an incel have it wrong. Eren is being honest with how he feels (he loves Mikasa) and of course his true feeling are that he wants to be the one with her. But he knows this isn’t possible and so while he’s being honest with Armin, he tells Armin that Mikasa can’t know that’s how deeply he feels, so that she CAN move on eventually.
-	An explanation of Mikaksa’s dream with how she and Eren ran off when her answer in Marley was different would have been useful here. Maybe that was Eren showing her through PATHS the future in that situation, and they both realized that they would be happy together for a short while before external countries destroyed Paradis. Explaining this better would better illustrate that Eren only had one possible path forward, and he could never be true to his feelings for Mikasa as a result (and that would better show that he wasn’t being an incel but was just, for one brief moment in the entire series, being brutally honest to someone else about his emotions. And even then he erased Armin’s memories of that conversation, based on the translations of the leaks. But again, all this shit (if my interpretations are accurate) should be at least implied or directly stated through some memories or an Eren’s POV chapter or something.
-	Maybe Eren through being able to see the future realized that fully completing the rumbling would actually be to the determiner of Paradis, and keeping enough of the outside world alive and intact was paramount for long-term prosperity of the world in addition to peace. That would explain the past Titan holders manifesting to help the alliance. It was all part of Eren’s plan. Why couldn’t he survive if that’s the case? The world needs a villain to be untied against when fucking 80% of its population gets decimated so that moving forward, everyone, including Marley and Paradis, can move forward and rebuild together. And enough of the world was destroyed such that Paradis likely comes out as the new world superpower (see my comment history for why this would be the case), so if any future conflicts do arise, Paradis is not at risk of being destroyed as they are now the global hegemon. WHY IS NONE OF THIS EXPLAINED? WHY IS ALL OF THIS CONJECTURE ON MY PART AS THE READER?
-	WHY IS MIKAKSA ALL ALONE AT THE END? I appreciated the poetic scarf ending, but why is she alone? Why is Levi with Gabi and Falco? Why is Mikasa done so dirty like that, surrounded by no friends or loved ones? We need an extended prologue so we know she’s okay.
-	OK SOMEONE HELP GUYS IS EREN ACTUALLY BIRB IDK ENOUGH OF THIS SERIED TO COMMENT ON BIRB AND SCARF-KUN."

H-K_47,Awesomearia96,"the ending is questionable due to missing content i feel like we could have needed atleast 4-5 chapters to end the story. 

Most of the story was cut harder than freaking cyberpunk and tokyo ghoul re combined. But the chapter was kinda meh 4/10 but Levis character arc is 10/10. 

But on a positive note we got to [see best girl Hitch one more time, my spirit animal](https://imgur.com/a/0oI6b39)

And we got see Mikasa in a cute ponytail (and ErenMika kinda confirmed, fucking finally i waited years). 

11 years of reading AOT is a heavy toll to the body, I am going to miss this sub of all the early days when we had toxic death threats, to memes.

H-K_47,None,"I think that the changes that Isayama made were pretty arbitrary. He clung on to what loose connections could have been formed based upon what we already know - which are that Eren can control Titans while in Founder mode, and that Ymir obeyed King Fritz & Mikasa ""obeyed"" Eren.

It's possible that at one point 139 isn't even the direction where Isayama wanted to take the story, and that the previous events really had no connection to what happened on the last panel.

Honestly, the last panel is pretty much a meme, anyway. I refuse to believe that Eren had his own mother killed. The *already given* explanation is that Dina literally promised to Grisha that she would find him before she died. She was an aberrant in that regard, and Eren had nothing to do with it. That's just one example of the last panel obviously being total BS.

I won't let a meme panel take away my enjoyment of AoT. Neither should anybody here."

H-K_47,NoobFade,"I'd call this ending okay. I'm fine with Eren making himself the villian overall, but I have some problems with the details. The implication he killed his Mom without any other explanation of why it was necessary and him saying he didn't know why he wanted to on page 17 kinda sucked. I would much prefer something like ""I don't know why but I can't accept a world without freedom"". The Paradis vs rest of the world conflict resolution is fairly good. 

Still don't know why Historia asked Eren about having a kid though, or why Grisha gave Eren the titan. Ymir's actions also make very little sense to me. I get the Stockholm syndrome stuff, but idk what made Mikasa so special to her or why this was her preferred plan.

H-K_47,bloodrein,"The best part is Levi seeing his comrades, happy, and devoting his heart with them. I find that part could have been part of a decent ending. I teared up. I also, unlike a lot of others, am perfectly happy that Connie and Jean lived. I don't think that them surviving takes away from their sacrifice. 

The worst part is the absolute lack of explanation. 

I also would have liked follow up beyond Levi being in a wheel chair but I guess that's supposed to be a happy ending. He's done his duty, now he can rest. It does seem strange he'd end up under the care of Gabi and Falco, though.  Aside from him protecting Gabi, we hadn't seen too much closeness between them. 

What the Hell did Ymir want? She loved Karl Fritz so she decided Mikasa represented her?

 So...Ymir would take away the Titan Powers if Mikasa remained obsessed with Eren? 

Why did they bother with the worm, then? I guess he was going for science fiction here. Somehow, the worm made people turn into light giants who lived forever and devoured people. 

Eren made the decision to kill his own Mother because, I guess, he couldn't have controlled the Titan to go elsewhere? It just HAD to be her? Did Isayama really think that this was a big plot point which needed resolution? I don't understand how Armin could be like; ""Aw! Poor Eren! He had no choice!"" 

Why did Mikasa get headaches? Because she was being spoken to by Eren? 

I guess it's set up to conclude that all the ""time"" happens together, which was why Eren asked Mikasa about her hair in the beginning. 

Why did Eren tell Zeke that he had missed the part of his Father dying? That made it seem important! Like a chunk of information was missing which would clearly explain Ymirs and Eren's intentions. 

Also...why did they empathize Historia's pregnancy like it would be that important? I guess Historia is realizing the dream of being a good Mother when hers wasn't? Why was the other baby revealed so often? Just to parallel the death and destruction?  They used Historia as a plot device just to protect them. 

Them being peace keepers seems dumb, too. But now we know why they're all together and acting like they are all the best of friends. 

Also, it looked like Eldians that weren't on Paradis were being treated better. How? Wasn't the world brainwashed to hate them? How can the world just trust them or treat them normally? 

What was the point of Armin and Annie's relationship?  We barely got to see anything. 

Are the paths still there, then? Or is that ""land"" gone too? Why was Eren in the Titan's mouth? Why was Ymir watching everything and how was she doing that? How did Eren reincarnate to a bird? 

Overall, it's not the worst ending but it's unbelievable. It's annoying about Paradis' fate, too."

Why was he opposed to her having a child if he knew the future?

Why did Historia and Grisha agreed to his plan? And why did Historia look so depressed when she came for the farmer and when she was pregnant if it was something she wanted to do?

Perhaps some depth was lost due to the translation, like maybe the original japanese dialogue was more impactful? I'm not sure.

My personal interpretation is that the softboi eren scene was an attempt to portray him as a more human character who has hopes, dreams, and *feelings* (in stark contrast to the deadpan genocidal maniac that we've seen in the previous chapters). Like, I get the intention, but I also think it could have been executed better? Or idk maybe this is just me being nitpicky.

H-K_47,All-DayErrDay,"On the point of some people questioning whether Eren was destined to do this or whether it was his nature that caused him to do this, I really though it was both up until I realized a certain point. His nature obviously played a massive role in how he would react to each event that he faced, but knowing his own nature he manipulated his environment to shape what he would end up doing. Some segments and moments of Erens life were likely pretty natural, but he manipulated really significant moments like the titan eating his mother to shape him too. So seemingly he was both at the mercy of his own nature and the manipulation of his nature.

&#x200B;

Once he touched Historia is was a slow and painful acceptance of what his future self had set him up to do. Part of this acceptance was probably confusion and delirium caused by so many memories and the time distorting effect that they placed on him.

&#x200B;

The reality is that it seems like the future Eren could change something and then tell if certain things beyond that would happen. This doesn't mean he could see everything, but he was always able to see if Ymir gave up her power, and **THIS FACT** is what genuinely fucked Eren over. Eren was fucked from the start because future Eren could literally influence the single moments that **FORCED** the future to occur in certain ways. So Eren was **NEVER** free. He was always destined to go a certain route. His nature was his own demise."

Zeke tho, his plan never worked out, Yeagerists betrayed him, he'll be known as just another dead shifter despite being a royal titan and Eren's brother who came so close to saving the world.

F for monke"
H-K_47,guardian22222,"I think the biggest part which made ppl dislike the end is:


- eren following a path (which may be the best out of the paths he had seen) without himself really understanding why he has to do things this way.

He kinda lost his willpower and is just accepting it as his destiny, so we don't see him trying to break out of it for example by creating his own path like in the end of final fantasy 7 remake.

Although his friends stopped him and the rumbling, as the folks acted before, I don't see them chearing armin and co up, because eren is dead and they will look for someone to blame for, so the hatred continues which brings up the question if extingushing 80% of the population was really neccessary.


- the need of ymir to see someone else overcoming her/his feelings to another person in a extrem way by killing this beloved person. 


I mean ymir lived like 2000 years holding on to her love for fritz. in this time she should have seen a lot of ppl who loved each other but got seperated by the on holding „curse“ of her. 



at some point it shouldn't be so far off the mark to expect ymir developing and realizing that her striving towards fritz in contrast makes others losing the people they are striving towards. 


For example mikasas determination to kill eren could have been enough of an inspiration for ymir to overcome her feelings for fritz and therefore to stop her curse just before mikasas blade hit erens throat. 


Furthermore it could develop into turning out that ymir forced eren against his will to start the rumbling, to make an ultimate test for herself if his beloved ones would overcome their feelings and would stand up against him. this would actually answer why he didn't understand his own doing


However, all in one it just feels rushed and forced to be a bitter sweet/ bad ending"
H-K_47,None,"I'm failing to wrap my head around what happened to Eren this chapter. Was he actually yearning for freedom or just influenced by *p a t h s* and Ymir because Ymir also sought freedom? Was anything he did purposeful?   
My interpretation from this chapter is Eren ""felt like"" he wanted freedom from birth and wanted the rumbling because it was hardcoded into him by Ymir to fulfill the future she imagined where Mikasa kills Eren and overcomes her love for him, same thing with her and King Fritz.   


Eren's breakdown suggests this, since at that point his ultimate goal was not to achieve freedom at all costs, but to be with Mikasa and his friends. He wasn't willing to sacrifice himself for the cause since he said ""I don't want to die"". I don't know if along the story Eren has accepted his fate, or attempted to reject it but failed since it's impossible to change his fate. Either way it contradicts his character a lot, why would he constantly strive for freedom when he already knew it doesn't exist?!

H-K_47,None,"I tried really hard to like it, but it's just very underwhelming. i have no one to blame but myself though.

i was expecting a stomach drop level of a ""what the fuck"" reveal like i felt with the basement reveal,  but i didn't get that. if eren killing his mom was supposed to be that twist, then i hate it! lol eren's mom being eaten by his dad's ex is already a good twist on it's own and didn't need anything else imo.

i didn't even have a particular theory that i was hoping to get. i thought the erehisu baby theory was compelling at first but i started to get annoyed by all the shipwars that i just hoped there would be no romance at all. just an ending that tied up lose ends and gave closure to everyone.

i don't have an issue with eren's tantrum in the chapter. his brattiness has always been one of my favorite things about him but i'm not sure if it was supposed to be intentionally jarring or not to see his whole demeanor change. i'm just going to believe it was intentional because i like that angle more. the sudden uneasiness i felt realizing he's still the same impulsive cry baby teenager was the only ""wtf"" moment i really had. like he killed billions of people, innocent children included, at just 19 :/ the only other wtf moment was armin thanking him for doing so....

ymir fritz should've gotten more than  one chapter if i'm supposed to believe her stockholm syndrome love for king fritz and how it somehow parallels mikasa's love for eren. once again, another unnecessary thing added, i liked it better whenever eren ""freed"" her from being the kings slave. i thought her goal was to break free? nothing about her character makes sense, but i'm smooth brained compared to a lot of people here so if anyone could explain her character for me or what i didn't get, i'd love to be know.

HANGE WAS DONE SO DIRTY TOO i don't even want to get into that!!! love how yelena disappeared. also HATED everyone's ""thank you"" moments to eren at the end, ugh. i don't know why but i imagine his talk with annie to have been really awkward.

overall it just had a weird tonal shift and bad pacing. i liked SOME things about it but not enough to be a satisfying ending for me. i hate myself so i'm still tuning into the anime to watch part 2 of season 4

edit: omg forgot to add how embarrassed i am to be a reiner stan after that sniffing panel one of the most complex characters in the story ends with that image, bye"

Maybe even talking or acting  out of context for a second from a past or future conversation. Frankly any hints to show that eren is clearly loosing it would make the ending a lot more sensical.

\- A peace negotiation, where the gang represents the world to Paradis and Paradis to the world is therefore possible

I think the best thing is that none of the leaks prepared us for the reveal that >!Eren actually told everyone what his plan was but sealed their memories of the conversation so they wouldn't remember it until he died.!< That single fact elevates the whole chapter for me. Yes it's still unjustifiable genocide, yes there were far better options. Yes once you give it some thought you realize it was a flawed plan. But come on, Eren pulled a Lelouch but he's nowhere near as intelligent as Lelouch was. He saw the future, that's all the knowledge he had. He went along with what he thought was right, and I think Isayama made that point rather clear in his convo with Armin. His plan wasn't the best choice logically speaking, but Eren went with it anyways.

I'm not defending other flaws in the chapter (the whole rant about a hypothetical Mikasa boyfriend, Reiner being a pervert with Historia's letter... What the heck) but it turned out to be a decent ending. Could've been so much better, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be.

To leave his people in a worse off position than they were before? If Dina just ate Bertholdt, Grisha could’ve used the founder that day. If Grisha begged zeke to stop eren, why give him the powers?

H-K_47,None,"unpopular opinion, but I still love Eren. several people really put him on a pedestal and expected him to kill everyone with ease like the total ""Chad"" they made him out to be, but he's still a 19 year old guy with emotions and conflicts. I like that seeing the past and future memories gave him all the more mental trouble and pained him so much that even his thought process was affected negatively. I like that his innermost desires weren't that of freedom or vengeance but spending time with his loved ones. I like that despite all his longing for freedom he knows that he can't attain freedom for himself. It is understandable if you feel hurt that the ""stone cold killer who would destroy his enemies with ease and keep moving forward"" was more or less only his outermost persona of his actions, but it only makes him more nuanced for me. The real Eren is nobody special or badass but just a normal guy who had to burden the suffering that he never deserved.









Eren Yeager in the beginning was someone filled with anger and hatred for titans and people who weren't ""Free"", who kept persisting for his freedom and justified his actions with a black and white morality. Someone who would be willing to sacrifice anything for freedom and vengeance.








The Eren Yeager now is someone who understands people, someone who has been cursed with a predetermined path and the guilt that comes along with that path, someone who wanted freedom and love but knows that he can't get what he wants. someone who ultimately sacrificed himself and his freedom to become the very kind of monster he despised for the sake of setting his loved ones free from the hell he lived through. Someone who sacrificed his freedom so that others could be free."

H-K_47,CringeNaeNaeBaby2,"Okay my most satisfying interpretation of this is

-	Ymir was freed by Mikasa’s decision to kill Eren. Mikasa rose up to the man who caused her pain and stopped him, something Ymir wished she could do. Seeing that bravery set her free and ended the Titan curse. 
-	Eren’s plan worked, the rumbling wiped out most of their opponents. Marley/Remnants of the world and Paradis aren’t in conflict, they are working out peace negations but are prepared for war just in case. 
-	Eren still cared about his friends and did everything he did to protect them and the future. 
-	Maybe the incel Eren was a seriously flawed was of representing that deep down, he’s still the child-like, reckless, emotional Eren we used to be annoyed by. Still terrible though. 

I’m still deeply disappointed about the fact that Eren killed his mom, I hate the incel Eren scene, but I feel like if I stick to my interpretations, hoping that Eren didn’t die for nothing and somewhat caused peace, Ymir is free and ended the Titan curse through Mikasa, and that Mikasa moved on in general, but with a solemn sadness for Eren. I can keep moving forward, I can be free. Maybe a 6/10 ending."

So here's how I see the final chapter sequence by sequence, tell me what you think of my interpretation if you think it's wrong or correct.

>In a flashback, which I assume happened on the plane,  Eren meets Armin in Paths as children where he explains to him that he killed 80% of the world. Basically no more, no less than he needed to save Paradise from military retaliation.  
>  
>The heartless Eren that wanted Genocide was never real, read chapter 131 again if you disagree. Leaving behind what is probably small fractured nations without the capacity to mount an immediate invasion of Paradise. He then let's his friends be the heroes of the saga by killing him, the Villain.  
>  
>He also implies that Mikasa broke away from his toxic attachment to him by killing him which parallels and caused(?) Ymir breaking away from her toxic attachments to King Fritz (Stockholm syndrome). Edit: Holy shit that's why she was smiling during Eren's death  
>  
>An older Eren breaks down at the thought that he won't be with Mikasa and that he won't be able to live with his friends, regrets his destiny is to die. Eren and Armin share a goodbye before Eren erases his memories. It seems to be implied that he had a similar heart to heart  with all of them before erasing all their memories as well, which all  comeback at Eren's deaths.  
>  
>All the pure Titans return to normal and Titans are finally wiped from existence. The disappearing flesh of the Titans forms steam from the hot steamy memories of their fallen compatriotes they're having.  Giving us a heartwarming 'Dedicate your heart' from Levi to all his fallen brethrens.  
>  
>Ever convincing and charismatic Armin is shown to engage in a tense talk with the surviving people of Marley while Mikasa slips-off with the severed head of Eren.  
>  
>Flashback to 3 years later, the Yeagerists make a military government and build a militaristic society that readies itself for total war, but under the thumb of  Historia. The fate of the world is sorta open-ended and balances between war until the total annihilation of one side and peace.  
>  
>The surviving cast of characters (whom now appear to live in the  non-destroyed nations and work as ambassadors between them and Paradise)  are traveling back to their home island for peace negotiations.  
>  
>Reiner sniffs Historia's letter and they banter, showing us that our characters seem to be in a decent headspace and at peace with the events.  Armin expresses his hope for a diplomatic solution.  
>  
>The last pages  shows us the last person, excluding Historia, that still lives in paradise from the cast: Mikasa. She sits before their childhood tree where  she buried Eren's head and laid a small makeshift tombstone. She awaits her friends that will surely come to pay their respects at their arrival.  
>  
>She sobs wishing Eren could be there with them and a  bird comes picking at her scarf, she smiles and watches the bird fly away towards the sky, thanking Eren for 'wrapping the scarf around her', the bird  obviously symbolizing Eren."

A good analysis of the ending. If you don’t like pausing vids, catch the stories on @/erensfiller’s IG."
H-K_47,murasakisumire,"So in the end....what eren has done was the right thing to do based on the alliance and paradis's reactions (despite everyone being genocide bad a few chapters ago) and historia herself said that the only way the war will end is when either side is wiped out which is....what eren initially tried to do........then plis make it makes sense why eren need to keep the 20% alive when he already stomped 80% of the world. 

Why? Because ymir dont wanna help anymore since she got front seat view of eremika drama which conclusively makes her forget her severe 2000 years stockholm syndrome and vanishes? 

Like fr, the ending would make much more sense and satisfying if eren just rumbled the world until nothing left. But ofc wtf can i do about it lmao"

H-K_47,firelordsavan,Yeah AnR ending would have been better IMO
H-K_47,TheOneAle97,"Ok first impression i hate it.
Then i re read with more attention and i came to the conclusion that after the timeskip the end isn’t so terrible.
1-Historia never wanted to be the focus of the event and his plot for me is just a bait for the readers (bad written imo)
2-  reiner and Jean convo was just there for the memes
3- the end of Levi can be watched as the invincible soldier who now doesn’t have to fight anymore and can rest and have a good life. (Sorry for the wheelchair, it’s horrible, but I can find a decent meaning)

What is really orrible is the first part, it’s like “why you do this?” and “don’t know, just follow the flow of events”. The part of Carla is something criminal, even stupid considering that Abnormal Titans had “special behavior”, and this makes the last words of Dina meaningless. Then eren love confession is ok, not completely but we all know he cared about mikasa, maybe the dialogues don’t help.
Last shit I can say is that the story doesn’t have a moral. Maybe yes, we can say that we have to accept our differences but the world of AoT was in war against Eldian for their ability and now is in war with eldia because of the rumbling so.... I don’t know.

My personal mark is 4,5/10. These are only my PERSONAL opinion, I’m happy if you like the chapter, I would like too.
However, definitely better than GoT and The new trilogy of Star Wars"

H-K_47,cheesyvoetjes,"I'm not a fan of the ending to be honest. It's not a Game of Thrones ending that ruins the entire series, but it feels a bit unsatisfactory. I don't understand how killing 80% of humanity could be the goal. It would not solve anything. I don't know how many people are in the Aot universe but there are 7 billion people on earth today. If you were to kill 80% that would still leave around a billion people. How many people are on Paradis? A few thousand? Even if it's a million, the rest of the world could still wipe them out if they wanted to. There's no titans or fear of rumbling protecting them. So they're worse of than they were. It's stated that Eren wanted to make everyone look like heroes, but it's also stated that after 3 years they where still doing peace negotiations so that didn't really work out either. Also nothing about Historia or her baby. Nothing about Ymir.  What happened to her? She just died? Paths just stopped existing? Maybe not the most important questions, but still. I also thought the explanation about Ymir being in love with Fritz doesn't really fit. Sucks that it's over though. It's been one hell of a ride."
H-K_47,BlaineCountiesMostWa,What the fuck happened to Yelena?
H-K_47,birdynamnam115,"Unless I'm reading it wrong, isn't mikasa implying that Eren manipulated her memories as well??? Wasn't the whole point of the Ackerman persecution that they were immune to that? Did this really get retconned in the very last chapter?"
H-K_47,darthloopzoop,"After actually reading the english typeset I’m less upset with this ending, I still don’t like how Eren suddenly is in love with Mikasa and the explanation for Ymir’s actions (yikes), but I like the overall message that no matter what humans will always be at war with each other. Nice to see Jean alive and well too. Shame he still hasn’t moved on from Mikasa to the clearly superior option that is Pieck."
H-K_47,Stormlord1441,"the more i sit on it, the less i like this chapter, as well as some of the past chapters. it feels like it's going against the buildup of not just this arc but the series itself too.

this whole time, the story has been, at least partially, planned. reiner and bertholdt being titans, the reiss family, eldia, marley, paths, that was all thought up by isayama beforehand. that is why we've had such big payoffs before, isayama had a concrete idea of what he was going to do. he is really good at this, as im sure you will all agree.

the past couple of chapters, starting at 133, have been isayama pantsing. for whatever reason, he didn't want to go with the plans (that i assume, as ive heard discussion about an ""original ending"") he had before. in other words, he didn't know what to do for the ending. this is the complete opposite of what isayama has had so far, hes out of his element. and as such, we get this. ""thanks for being a mass murderer,"" inconsequential moments like levi getting bitten or jean connie and gang becoming titans, ymirs bizzare arc. all of this is a far cry from the planned storytelling of isayama. it really is a shame that the end wasn't something he thought of enough before hand."
H-K_47,Constantierul,My only problem with this chapter is the fact that Eren killed his mother but couldnt kill his friends...i'm like yo wtf
H-K_47,None," If mobile breaks the format I’ll move this. Note: the bad typeset is what we have to work with, it’s likely some of what I say is subject to change. This is also just my opinion and I may have forgotten things myself. I’m struggling on where to go with this, many will make statements better than I can and I’m on this soapbox to vent steam from other sources too. It’s 3 AM, excuse my shitty grammar. 

For context on me, (feel free to skip.) I previously had no visual for the ending. I was almost on the side of the alliance, more neutral than anything. I didn’t like how they were pulled off per se but i loved isayama’s depiction of eren as a master enemy. The complexity behind the rumbling made it infinitely captivating. 
 I loved the idea of a dark ending. I loved the idea of a happy ending.

My main issue with all this is how much Isayama managed to forget about his own manga. It bleeds into other issues below. I don’t even know where to start, this feels like a fanfiction Isayama drew for someone. 

For starters, everything here just feels kind of cheap. Reiner being gnawed at by 3 Titans only for everything to magically be ok. Levi’s ruptured organs are never brought up again. Eldia-marleyan relationships are solved by saying you would’ve killed them by now but you obviously can’t because you’re not a Titan. It goes on. 

Next, where’d the worm go? That hallucigenia deep in the tree started this whole thing. This chapter didn’t acknowledge him at all. Ymir shouldn’t have been the one to free people from the Titans, the Titan crushing the hallucigenia should’ve been the one to free people from the Titans. 

And then the part where mikasa’s memories were wiped too breaks the previously established “Ackermans cannot have their memories wiped.” 

Dina was directed by eren to kill Carla, (there’s a sentence im drawing blanks for rn.) 
Not only does it break established lore on one end, it fucks with the implications from earlier too where Dina says she’ll look for grisha no matter what form she takes on. Going back to eat his new wife reflected that perfectly. Revealing eren to have been the one who led her to kill his own mom?? Seriously?

Things that needed more information are here.
Beretolt wasn’t supposed to die? What? Says who? When was there a fate here? Hasn’t most of this manga been about liberation? 

“You started this story” and you are supposed to be in full control of it. The rumbling’s detonator was based on factors outside driving him to trigger it. He was backed into a corner by the existence of others’ free will acting on his own. His free will backing other forces into a corner by his existence, too. Nobody forced him to do this. 

Here’s where I’m getting into the disastrous implications he made along the way too.

Eren has never given any indication of loving mikasa. He even told her she was a slave to him. I could see an argument for how this wasn’t completely out of left field in that “you are family” panel, but there were other ways of claiming it to be mutual than fumbling eren’s previously established character. Isayama also said romance was unimportant to the plot. None of this lines up with anything said previously. Your brother yelling at you about how much he hates your guts is most certainly not love. Killing a man and then kissing his decapitated head doesn’t sound very loving either. 

I feel like executed correctly, that scene in 138 could’ve been perfect for a very fucked up scene cut straight from EVA or berserk. Instead, when combined with “ymir loves fritz” it ended up sounding like yams believes this is what love should look like. 

There are infinitely better relationships to choose from that could’ve freed ymir had he really been intent on telling this tale.  And why did they have to be romantic? EMA at one point had an amazing dynamic. Considering AOT is a shonen, he could’ve used them as an example of relationships gone sour and an older group as relationships living healthily like the veteran trio.

To me this feels kind of like he wanted a quick way to make a protagonist on protagonist ship canon. 

Second, the “EREN THANKS FOR COMMITTING MASS MURDER FOR OUR SAKE” is such a strange sentiment.  Maybe it was due to a translation error but it gives off a pro-genocide ideal when the rest of the manga was very very very blatantly anti-genocide. This coming from armin didn’t make any sense, especially when you consider that Eren practically left them to die. Paradis is a boxed in region in the middle of nowhere with an insignificant population compared to the rest of the world, no matter how weak that world may be. It noted they would take at least another 50 years to catch up with the rest of the world."

H-K_47,alphasloth1773,"Personally after all the build up through season 4 chapters I just feel meh. 

I personally would’ve loved with barely any tweaking the story could’ve ended with everyone realising this was ultimately a human story and how messsd up and evil humans are. The Titans may be gone but they weren’t ultimately the bad guys. Now paradise army is huge and powerful and 80% of the rest of the worlds population is killed they would become the primary force in the world. Showing ultimately all humans have capacity for evil it doesn’t matter who’s in control. The Titans were just the sideshow for the evil of humanity behind them."

H-K_47,None,"Eren wanted to be free, but he didn't know what freedom consisted of. Is it going against the rules? Is it doing something forbidden? Is it beating the enemy? He wanted to feel it, so that freedom became an obsession to him. The fact that the only curiosity about the outer world derived from the consistent lack of freedom confirms that he would never find freedom outside himself. Failing to notice it, he masked his obsession with the noble intent of saving his friends - as if he had to do it by himself and nobody else was allowed to help, because that was *his* road to freedom. And the turnout was not good, but even even if he succeeded in his plan he wouldn't be free, because at that point repentance would prevail. 

What is freedom? Does it even exist? Is freedom what I say it must be, or is it something else?  

Is it living? Is it dying? Is it even worth wondering? 

 I wish he had stopped for just one second to admire how beautiful a sunny day is."
H-K_47,roteFanta,"I don't know how often I have changed my feeling about this chapter. Few hours ago I wrote that I might like the chapter and now I had to come back and write some thoughts about that I might not like it haha. Ever since the rumbling started I had to come to terms with Eren eventally having to die at the end of the manga. He was unredeamable. And him keeping his mouth shut eventhough his friends wanted to share his burden made me angry. I know he wanted them to be the heros bla bla. And I know many of you are upset that Eren is not that cold and calculating ""keep moving forward until my enemies are all destroyed"" guy. But seeing the old Eren again, the emotional one, and him expressing his desire that his friends should live a long life and his sadness that he won't be able to join them is really upsetting. And also that it had to be Mikasa who had to kill him. The one who was most concerned with his survival ( btw as for me, even if it were Armin to kill Eren, it would be as cruel as Mikasa doing it). Ahh.. I'm sad for him that he was caught up in all this just because Ymir was a slave with stockholm syndrom. She was waiting for MIKASA to show her how to move on. Not for Eren. She has been using him his whole life. Ever since wall Maria broke down he couldn't find peace. He didn't have a break. And he was always used as humanities hope and later as enemy. He has been pushed into several roles this whole time just to get slaughtered before Ymir."

Like I know there are people who ship EM, and it's been clear for a long ass while that Mikasa romantically loves Eren. 

But has Eren ever shown anything that could be clearly be interpreted as ""romantic"" love to Mikasa in the whole series bar this panel? Like even if Eren reacted about it in a more platonic way I think it would have been  more natural. It just seems almost shoehorned in so that Eren has a canon love interest."

H-K_47,Ciullante,"The one thing I'm very disappointed with this ending is that the only thing accomplished is the end of the titan's curse. But it's a weird message to pass, it's like saying that if we make all black people white there won't be racism anymore towards them (yes black guys don't usually eat people, but even eldians don't become titan if they don't get the injection, besides from shifters). And the funniest thing is that they continue to hate each others. In a world with technology having 9 titan around would be a lot less of a problem than 80% of people killed. The only reason that I see behind eren decision (if he made decisions) is to save Armin, that is the man that will save the world in his mind, from the curse of 13 years.

I’ve always agreed with “erens” actions and ideas, so who’s ideas and actions was I actually agreeing with?

I am still sad though especially since the whole experience since season 3 part 1 got ruined by knowing that erens going to die. On the other end I literally cried since chapter 135 since I knew it was about to happen very soon.

I don't see why this twist was necessary, he already had established motives just have him follow through on his beliefs, even if he would lose at the end. Instead we get this wimp that murdered 80% of the world for something he didn't even believe him. All those tatakae scenes, what the fuck were they for? Was he putting up a show for himself?

H-K_47,ms_103127,"I know I'm taking a risk by posting this, since I'm certain the majority of you won't agree, but what the fuck, I do like and respect most of you lol:

Just finished what I think is the official English translation. Tbh, I'm numb, not 100% certain everything that I read is legit, and just sad and need the night to emotionally process everything....

While the ending didn't explicitly answer everything, which I think was intentional via Isayama and left up to our imaginations (or maybe the anime will address this, who knows), I thought it was beautifully and emotionally written, and I consider it a worthy end of this beloved series. For me, this was truly a bittersweet ending: the ""bitter"" being that we lost Eren, the ""sweet"" being that something as simple as love doing ""crazy things"" at times can truly affect the world, and ironically, thanks to Eren, Eldians/Paradisans and the other allied nations can at least take a baby step forward towards peace.

Some other aspects that I feel are worth mentioning are:

\~ Armin and Eren's closure and conversation.

\~ Everyone's reactions when their memories are restored.

\~ Armin's pain at seeing Eren's severed head.

\~ Levi, Connie, and Jean when they see their fallen comrades. I got goosebumps with the salute.

\~ Mikasa's final moments.

\~ Eren-bird lol

One clarification that I would like is, toward the end, the 'Nation of Eldia' is mentioned. Does that mean that the surviving Eldians reestablished their own soveregn country, or is Paradis Island now considered the Nation of Eldia? Did I miss something?

Anyway, thanks for reading, even if you hate/dislike me and the ending lol. It's truly been an honor dedicating my heart to this series. Now we get to look forward to the conclusion of the anime next year!"
H-K_47,LeoPhoenix93,"So Eren went from: “I’ll destroy the entire world to protect my friends and the people I care about even if everyone will hate me for it”

H-K_47,9rainbowdevil,"""I dont even know why I started the rumbling, everything is confuse now""

my god

it's just like SAO"
H-K_47,Cachxlot,"I just read the chapter. Big feels, big confusion. Here's a bit of a summary of the important elements that I got out of this last one : 

&#x200B;

We are shown Eren and Armin's discussion through the Paths, which actually happened while the squad was on the azumabito ship I think ? It's a conversation that Ereh erased from Armin's memory and made it so that he would only recall it after  [killing him](https://imgur.com/a/O5QLKWH) . Moreover, Eren reveals that he kinda  [let his mom die](https://imgur.com/a/XkvieaE)  by saving Bertholt so that all could go as planned, bc he needed Armin to inherit the colossal titan from him ig.

Eren seems to have actually [spoken to a lot of the MCs through the paths](https://imgur.com/a/TlV7dVB) but we only get Armin's pov. 

We learn that Founder Ymir remained a slave even after gaining the titan power because of  [her love](https://imgur.com/a/NHj56R9) towards King Fritz, and that's why her curse was around for so long. She waited to be freed for 2 000 years, but Eren actually couldn't do it on his own. The keystone to that problem was  [Mikasa](https://imgur.com/a/1ntbOJT) .

Why ? Well actually, Mikasa is a parallel to Ymir, as of being a slave to one's love. So now  [this panel](https://imgur.com/a/aZzNteP) in which we see the founder smiling at Mikasa kissing Eren after killing him makes much more sense. 

By killing the one she was an enslaved lover to, by making that [choice](https://imgur.com/a/7i3giws) , Mikasa gave Ymir the courage to free herself (or just freed her ? idk that can be interpreted in many ways ig). And that's how  [an end was put to the titans](https://imgur.com/a/ymQOoBn) .

Therefore, all the characters that were transformed into primitive titans last chapter ( and [before](https://imgur.com/8GLUHN3) ) are now all back to normal, as well as the [shifters being freed from the 13 years curse](https://imgur.com/a/gJlyRBy).

After that, everyone realises why Eren did what he did (when they remember). Everyone is big sad. The Mahr immediately start threatening the Eldians, but Armin imposes himself as a  [great diplomat](https://imgur.com/a/uq32b0A) , as usual. 

Then comes the epilogue : basically, no more problems due the titans but [people in the world are still fucked up](https://imgur.com/a/HssQxaw) . 

&#x200B;

That was a big last chapter. I'd say I don't like it nor dislike it. Even though some lines of dialogue seemed a little bit off ( mostly when Eren talks about his feelings ) it may just be because I read an early fantrad. My opinion on it is that it's just ok, and I think it's coherent to the rest of the story. In the end, Eren wanted everyone to turn on him so that they could be considered the heroes and live in peace. He was just a child given a mission, and after accomplishing it, after realizing all it took, he let loose. 

All those emotions and feelings finally emerged, letting us know that all that badassery and ""I'm the bad guy"" shenanigans were just a facade for him to succeed in reaching his goal. 

In my opinion, that last chapter made Eren's character more human. It didn't ruin it or anything but brought a new dimension : he went from a selfish devil whose goal was to use power to assert his people's dominance to a human that was willing to sacrifice himself to free humanity from its biggest burden. Eren is imo still an S-Tier character that put his feelings aside and made many sacrifices for the sake of humanity and his people's freedom."
H-K_47,marta03,"The ending was okay. There are bits I liked and bits I didn't like.

For example, the paths weren't explained enough. But I think that would have been too much of a hassle to do. The biggest turnoff for me personally was that Ymir just needed to be set free by Mikasa, proving to Ymir that you can go of love and make a decision that's not selfish (for Mikasa - killing Eren, for Ymir - letting go of the titan curse). I think that could have been done better. Felt rushed. If it were in the span of 2 chapters, then it would take a while for us to take in and accept. Needed to be more fleshed out, imo.

Now that I think of it and let the chapter sink in, I think Historia getting pregnant and Eren's ""bad character developent"" were a good thing. Eren just talked to Hisu so she can survive in the worst case scenario by getting pregnant. We don't really need to know who the father is, because that's irrelevant. For sure it's not Eren, it's that farmer. As to the fact that people hate how Eren's character development was pulled down the drain this chapter, I have to disagree. Eren was always like this. After he saw what the founder and his future self have in store for him (by touching Historia's hand) he came to realize that the only way his friends are gonna stay alive is by him sacrificing himself. Idk really if that was Ymir's influence or Eren's (or both??), but he came to accept it. He's just a kid put in the worst situation ever, would anyone know what to do? His only precious people are his comrades, of course he'll try to alter the end result as much as he can.

As for the bits I liked - Eldians are still seen as the devils although they cannot turn into titans any more. There is no good ending for our protagonists, just like real life - we can't predict the future and nor could Eren at that extent. He achieved his goal of setting himself free (by dying) and killing (more like getting rid of) every titan. I don't feel like it was out of place for Eren to talk about his feelings towards Mikasa, because he has feelings for her. The scarf scene, Dina's titan scene (where Mikasa thought they were gonna die and confesses) and the part where Eren talks about how he loves his comrades and keeps looking at Mikasa. You don't need to be bubbly about your feelings to have them, especially for a person like Eren. He has other things he has to focus on because of his burden.

Overall I give it a 7/10. Thank you, Isayama."

H-K_47,None,"I think if that Eren Armin convo didn't exist, rather it went something like.
""I know Armin. But I had to do this. I knew that if I didn't, Paradis would not stand a chance. I had to do it"" instead of giving an answer like ""I don't know, I really wanted to do it"", and that he essentially enabled his mom to get killed, I would kind of accept the ending. But now, I refuse to accept it. I thought 133 solidified Eren's resolve. But then why the sudden change in resolve? It seems like a last minute ditch. Like instead of his true feelings for Mikasa, which was never even foreshadowed, I think his devotion to his ideal vision of freedom would have made him a much more tragic character. Like why Isayama? I'm thankful that I actually get to experience an ending, but why like this Isayama? You gave me the best story I've ever read to only disappoint with the ending. I wanted to cherish it forever, but I must forget the ending to do that. Nothing truly is perfect in life.

H-K_47,Karpthegarp,"Well, reading the full thing was a lot better for some reason. But I can't say that I like the ending. Maybe it's just that I set my expectations higher or in a different direction, I'll always see this ending as disappointing.

Though, perhaps I've been looking at Eren in a way I shouldn't have. And I'm not talking about 'Chad Eren' meme, but rather the determination MCs usually have/show for their goals. With Eren, he felt weak at the end despite him looking strong in the last few years, but maybe that reflects how humans really are in the end.

I don't know how I feel about this yet... might need to think about it some more."

Having these wants and desires but not acting on them and actually pushing Mikasa away so that she can possibly be with someone else after his death does not make him an incel or a Simp."
H-K_47,new_freaking_account,"This chapter has left me confused. From what I have gathered, it turns out Ymir was in control of practically everyone's destinies (especially Eren's) and the only thing she cared about was to get Mikasa to kill Eren (as someone Mikasa is attached to) to get over her own Stockholm Syndrome? Eren has only been along for the ride, so it never mattered whether he actually wanted to use Dina to kill his mom and manipulate his father to bring himself on this path or not, or whether he himself was willing to finish the rumbling and guarantee Paradise's future by forcing an end to the cycle of hatred or not, or how he wanted to live past the rumbling with his friends, because that was the inevitable destiny Ymir has planned? So at the end of the day, the thing Paradis was free of was actually Ymir's machinations, while the cycle of hatred remains an unresolved burden left for Armin to somehow solve, albeit with less outside pressure, but without the power of titans?

Can't say I'm a big fan of a ""Nothing matters, just Ymir"" ending, if thats the case."

One thing i can say about ending is it doesn't matter for me if its good or bad. And it doesn't matter that some characters died and some lived. 

Because what mattered most is that all the loose ends had to tied without creating plotholes. Sadly that didnt happen. 

But again the journey was worth it. Irrespective of the destination. This will most likely be my final post here.

My opinion of the chapter notably improved after I read it, with points Isayama was going for far more clear and making more sense than what we initially got, having less 'cringy' dialogue from Eren/Armin/Reiner/Mikasa, imo giving more clarity to ""lol idk why I rumbled"", and even the whole Ymir thing by just saying ""loved"" instead of ""in love"", even with the shortcomings."

So now Paradis is free to either accept the peace offer or use their relative military power to wipe out the remnants of the outside world once and for all, but the key point is that both these options are now completely untied from the power of the Titans."

She still rallies back and saves humanity after suffering her greatest loss. Isn’t that already kind of moving on and accepting Eren’s death. Moving on from that love she had? I guess that’s enough for Ymir because she didn’t kill Eren? Did Ymir want to see Mikasa kill Eren because he was a blight on humanity, and was going to extinct nearly the entire human race, something the King did 2000 years prior. Or did she want to see someone move on from a love lost? Because she kind of already did that at the beginning of the series. Shit makes no sense to me"

H-K_47,Vlad5543,"So, about mikasa’s dream in 138. From what I understood, it was Mikasa’s equivalent to Armin’s conversation with Eren (hence the marks on erens face in both scenes). Like Eren contacted mikasa through the paths at a certain time like he did with Armin on the boat and then erased their memories until the point of his defeat. And what gave mikasa confidence to kill eren is the fact that she remembered those erased memories. Is that right or are both separated?"

It is kind of underwhelming that the reason of Ymir was really this. I expected it to be something like that Ymir wanted everyone in the world to be able to be free. That everyone including the eldian king. In a way this wish of her would have been granted in the same way as a Jinn grants a whish. Meaning that the supernatural being grants your wish in a way which is really not how you expected and essentially very bad. But this explanation probably would have required more content, and for some reason they really wanted to end the story."

H-K_47,deepthr0at,The biggest plot hole in this chapter was that Connie/Gene/Gabi and all the other people that turned into mindless titans all magically still had their clothes when they turned back into human.
H-K_47,falsesgod,"This is why I’m so grateful I didn’t judge the leaks so hard because we got the bittersweet ending we were promised (minus that weird eren confessing his feelings which I was so surprised to see). I liked the ending and finally hearing eren’s side was... refreshing.  

Wasnt mind-blowing but it wasn’t disappointing. I’m... fine i’m fine.

Also.. the way it starts with Mikasa and ends with Mikasa. I love it."
H-K_47,Angryboy13,"Even though I fucking hated this chapter people are really smooth-brain on the Ymir/Mikasa love subplot. Honestly disappointed in you guys:

* Ymir had no idea wtf love was
* Since Fritz wed her and gave her the tiniest bit of affection she mistook it as love
* Mikasa killing Eren and kissing him was Ymir's first time seeing someone break out of love
* Just as Eren told her ""she's free"" and followed his rumbling plan ignoring the orders of someone with royal blood (Zeke), Mikasa killing Eren freed Ymir from Eldians and paths."
H-K_47,cornpenguin01,"Holy shit, I don’t even know what to say. I’m not on the alliance or Yaegerist (incelist side now? Idk), but that was dogshit. Every single plot point and character possible met the worst possible outcome from a narrative perspective.

*Why is Reiner a simp at the very end?* He was the best character and that’s his final scene?"
H-K_47,rubbie,Historia not having a single line of dialogue might be the most disappointing thing in the whole chapter tbh
H-K_47,yukinowins,"I might get hated for this. I’ve made my peace. I don’t fully agree that it’s character assassination but I’m just going to say that trying to subvert our expectations after all these years with Eren going back to his old pre TS skip in the final chapter was a bad idea and executed horribly. The scenes with Armin and Eren growing up as they progress through their memories is SO COOL but god the dialogue is absolutely horrible I can’t really get into it. “Thank you for becoming a mass murderer for us” feels so awkward after they set out to stop him because they couldn’t agree with genocide in the first place. I would have rather Eren confessed he didn’t want Mikasa to have feelings for another guy in the previous chapter or earlier because it being framed alongside his resolution for doing the Rumbling leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I should be sad my favorite character doesn’t get to live the life he wanted but I just feel nothing.






We already knew Eren was extremely broken how he’d have to start the rumbling to save Paradis from the little we saw of him in past chapters but the Eren we got in 139 feels like it belonged to a completely different build up. What happened to the brave/determined Eren from 121? Why couldn’t he go down with some dignity? The chapter is filled with tons of vague answers and forced plot twists (Eren controlling Dina, Ymir waiting 2000 years for Mikasa who she had never interacted with) that just fall flat and that is not supposed to happen in a final chapter. It’s really sad how this forces me to revisit a lot of post TS scenes and I have to ask who even this guy? 





I’ve read the chapter three different times with the most recent being the official translation and while I have certainly lightened up to the ending I am still just disappointed."
H-K_47,ShibeBaka,"All I want for the anime to do is   


\>Say like 95% of the world has been trampled instead of 80% so that paradis wont have 300 million enemies  
\>Change the part where eren says he wants mikasa to love only him to be a bit more mature  
\>Entirely change Ymir's motivation to something else like she wanted to feel loved, her loving Fritz is the dumbest thing ever  
\>Remove Reiner smelling Historias letter"

H-K_47,nishmt,"Leaving for now, but not before i yell into the void that **80% of the population died because Eren didn’t get with someone who wanted to get with him**"
H-K_47,Farley778,"I didn't like the sound of the leaks but after reading the complete chapter I think this is a fairly serviceable (albiet rushed) ending. 

The events of the chapter just needed some more space to breathe. 

I know almost nothing about manga serializations but is there any reason why Isayama couldn't have made the final chapter, say, 70 pages? Wrapping up 138 chapters worth of content in 46(?) pages just isn't ideal. 

The Ymir actually loved Fritz revelation was borderline comical, but as another commenter posted, could have easily been fixed somewhat with just a single panel of Fritz showing kindness to Ymir.
Better yet, give Fritz and Ymir's interactions a full page. Explain how Ymir came to harbor love for Fritz despite his ability for violence and cruelty.

If we are supposed to see parallels between Fritz/Ymir and Eren/Mikasa, and these similarities ultimately lead to Ymir realizing she can be free and the titan curse being lifted (arguably the most significant event in the entire story) her feelings for Fritz need to be made somewhat believable. One panel of her looking at Fritz surrounded by his harem does not accomplish this.

Extra pages could have allowed for some more nuance in how the other characters react to the new revelations about Eren as well. I mean, the dude just wiped out 80% of humanity and Armin fucking thanks him? Some characters (Armin and Mikasa) could have come to accept his reasoning while still condemning his methods, but it would have been interesting to see some of our favourites continue to condemn him entirely. 

If the anime made this chapter into a double episode and gave the events of the ending some extra detail, I think it's possible to make this a 7/10 ending. As it is it's a 5/10 in my opinion, but it certainly doesn't make the show unwatchable like S8 GoT.

(I have no opinion on Eren/Historia. I agree that her story seemed a bit overlooked, but the fact that she ended up with the Farmer doesn't bother me. I have, however, decided to believe that Jean ends up with Pieck and I really need my boy Reiner to find someone so he can stop sniffing royal stationary. Hitch?)"

H-K_47,shnn_twt,"I'm... actually crying right now, and not because of disappointment this time. I feel genuinely sad for Eren. His entire life and demise was so tragic, it's almost too cruel. Him breaking down in front of Armin and shedding tears isn't cringe to me anymore, it's absolutely heartbreaking. The official translation made the entire scene a lot better, I understand why he said what he said. ""...I don't want to die. I want to be with Mikasa... **with everyone**"". By the time he realized that Mikasa loved him, it was too late, he had already received future and past memories. I guess he couldn't allow himself to get involved with her, knowing his inevitable fate, so that's why he pushed her (and everyone else) away. 

All he wanted was for his friends to be happy. But more importantly, he wanted to be happy **with them.** Him being afraid and not wanting to die just *kills* me. I'm so used to characters bravely meeting their fate and heroically accepting death that this completely caught me off guard and tore my heart apart. 

I stopped reading after Eremin's conversation. I still.. wouldn't call this ending good, I don't even know if I'm satisfied with the conclusion of Eren's character - it's just too tragic, too dark and painful, it’s now what I wanted for him, and maybe it could’ve been executed better, but I don't think that it's bad anymore. 

Also, Armin's little ""Oh. I.. didn't expect something that pathetic"" after Eren's outburst was so fucking funny, it had me laughing through tears. Armin acknowleding that Eren's little ""tantrum"" was uncharacteristic of him was nice, it made the scene more tolerable (and a bit more lighthearted).

Overall, I still deeply love Eren and I don't think anything will ever change that. He's truly one of the most tragic characters in animanga (and maybe even fiction, although I'm probably reaching). 

Fly high, Eren. The boy who sought freedom till the bitter end."
H-K_47,SoddenSlop461,I thought it was good. I can completely understand why eren breaks down to Armin. In the end it was the ending I thought was going to happen so I don’t have much too complain about.  Even if you don’t like the ending please don’t bash Isayama.

The whole “I don’t want mikasa with someone else” part was pretty creepy and weird, I’m starting to understand what maybe Isayama meant with this ending, but it’s just so rushed, it needed at the very least a few more chapters to properly close important plot holes. It’s a mediocre ending at best (in my opinion) and the reason everyone is reacting so badly to it, is because this fan base is used to amazing writing, and at the most important moment, it just flopped."

It’s hard to believe because it makes absolutely zero sense for her to do. This has to be one of the most egregious examples of shoehorning in an explanation I’ve seen out of this chapter. There’s no context for this, no lead up to support this that I can remember. Just a disappointing revelation in all honesty.

Eren, the man dedicated to a life of freedom, made every decision he did to follow a destiny that was laid out before him, completely contradictory to every facet of character development he had received up to that point. The ending in general isn’t that bad, but my god is it disappointing and a let down. Feels like he saw Code Geass and said ‘ye fuck it sounds good’ and just rolled with that."

H-K_47,Secure-Performance,"Idk why people are turning on eren now as if he’s a “cringe beta” or something. Did we read the same manga?? Eren has always been a whiny crybaby, he’s only 19 after all, he’s still more a child than an adult. He’s Mr “when I saw people outside the walls I was disappointed ☹️😥” Yeager. Like it or not Eren is not some chad or infallible monster, he’s just a person like anyone else. Yes, his soaking wet pity party was cringy and hilariously sad but to say this is a huge change in his character is just false. (I do hope that the official translation does make him less incel like though, cause I’ll admit this is extra, even for him.)"
H-K_47,epicreflection15,Conner has hair omg. Reiner is still historia fanboi but no more depression. Falco levi and gabi are together is cool. Onioncoupon cameo. Jean horse reference. Eren Armin Mikasa has closure. Pieck waifu. This the good ending

H-K_47,Oposo,Now if ERWIN had gotten the colossal titan imagine the beating he would have given Eren as he sheds his pussy tears in paths because mikasa might get over him
H-K_47,Raviolla,"really the two main things that caused so many problems for this arc were ymir and PATHS powers

her character arc was apparently the key to the story and the entire reason eren became a slave to his destiny, but yams didn't bother going deep into it to flesh it out. all eren said was 'only ymir can understand'

the inconsistency of PATHS powers is a BIG problem. you gave eren and ymir supposed god powers over titans, and you pit the alliance against them. the action scenes won't feel satisfying at all and if the alliance somehow manages to take a W it would feel convenient.

giving eren the power to influence other eldians/titans from any point in time, youre just ASKING for plot holes at that point

oh also another thing about PATHS powers is it created this whole mess with zeke. who the key to operating the rumbling was became confusing as hell"
H-K_47,iamdandyking,This story ended for me after S3P2.
H-K_47,Jayfiction,"I honestly feel very disappointed with the ending for a lot of reasons but not the whole thing with Frieda. It wasn't that Eren killed his mom, its that he couldn't stop it. God the pieces are all their but it's just put together wrong. I wonder of we will ever get the story of how this ending happened. Something feels off about it"
H-K_47,TMS21,"Literally the only thing I had an issue with was Eren apprently directing Dina's titan away towards his mom. Other than that, I really liked this ending. Eren accomplished most of the Rumbling to a point where the remaining 20% of humans, won't retaliate for a very long time due to the poor condition most of humanity is in outside of a few places. I am 100% willing to believe that the titans turned back to humans because of Ymir being freed from her love of King Fritz. Ymir's able to create titans and command them, so it's not far fetched for me that she's able to end their existence. 

Seeing everyone after 3 years was nice. It's interesting that Levi is hanging around with Gabi and Falco. I assume he's basically retired now since he's in a wheelchair, and Levi honestly deserves peace for the rest of his life. I felt so bad for Mikasa and actually had a heavy feeling in my heart when she said she wished she could see Eren again. Overall I thought it was a good ending to a amazing series."

H-K_47,Shadoo001,I think ultimately this further proved Reiner's point of why Eren was the worst possible person to have the founder
H-K_47,RitsusRats,"i guess it kinda makes sense why eren hating the titans so much was a driving force for and throughout the series; he was technically the one who killed his mom via the founding titan’s power (revealed in ch139 which is *my* interpretation), and hates the titans for his mom being killed by them (originally). it’s an endless cycle of hate. the founding titan and titans in general messed with his brain and influenced/presented the choice for him to do that, so his hate for them is a lot more complex than it seems."
H-K_47,wallnosekyla,So the theory that it was Eren’s plan all along proved to be true. That one panel with Bertholdt gave me goosebumps.

I'm so disappointed. I know she's not as important as other characters but she was  reduced to a red herring. Yikes."

Why did Zeke have to die?  Eren could've told him his real plan instead of leaving him alone in paths. What was even the purpose of the Hallu-chan in ch138?  Eren himself could've done the same and the alliance would be even more motivated to kill him."

H-K_47,Pandachyan,"Ending DEFINITELY was changed from what was planned. So many threads left unexplained, character motivations just reasoned away. This final chapter just felt like it was a complete 180 from how things were actually set up to happen."
H-K_47,luk3l1s,"Random thoughts have been flooding my poor brain for the past few hours after reading the chapter. I can not put them into words to create a proper post expressing all of my thoughts, but the main idea of all that is that the hyped up ""Eren POV"" is the reader of the story, at least since the paths. Incoherent, not knowing why some decisions were made, a wide mix of emotions, etc., as Eren himself stated, that he wasn't ok mentally ever since seeing the future and that hes been experiencing the past and the future at the same time or some shit

Edit: yo, also. I, as the reader, just like Eren, wanted the perfect ending, but the perfect ending doesnt exist, just like absolute freedom.. i should stop thinking about this ending, but i cannot please help

just like Eren, i am experiencing an absolute mess of emotions. sad, angry, confused, yet i can change none of those. just gotta keep moving"
H-K_47,LifeButBetter,"Okay hold up, I fucking love grown up Gabi and Falco, one of the better parts of the chapter IMO"
H-K_47,kugrond,"I like how ending felt somewhat realistic. Eren could achieve one thing (destroying titankind), but we don't know if there will actually be peace, he doesn't know himself and when Armin assumes so he just says ""I will destroy 80% of mankind, they won't be able to wage war immediatly"".

H-K_47,ani091,"So according to the official translation, Eren DID do the rumbling because of Mikasa’s answer in ch.123"
H-K_47,One-LeggedDinosaur,"I thought it was an ok ending.

What I don't get though is how did he wipe out 80%? He was stopped in Marley, right? Which is right next to the island. If we assume the rumbling was an expanding circle around the island the majority of it would have still been in the ocean

Edit: [Made a map](https://imgur.com/9xb4YI4) of how I imagine it."
H-K_47,AvalancheZ250,"In the end, I think my main gripe with this chapter was that it took Eren's character down a path I didn't ever think he would take. He didn't feel like Eren, the tragic but determined character who had to make the hardest choices in AoT history. The epitome of cyniclism and tragedy, contrasted with Armin, the brilliant beacon of idealism and the future.

Because Eren turned out to be so different, my intepretations of other characters around him that I also love (Armin and Mikasa especially) have also had to shift. Not necessarily for the worse, but some moments feel less impactful now.

I don't particularly like Chapter 139's ""true"" Eren, but I accept it. Mikasa got a decent ending (definitely could have been better) and Armin got a good ending (potentially could have been better) and Eren got the tragic ending I always wanted for him, even if it was done in a different way than I would have preferred and without sufficient respect for his character.

I disliked the chapter when I first read it and I still do, but I have made my peace with it. It won't stop me from fondly remembering all that came before, and all I learned from that. Isayama is still a genius for everything he wove into the story, even if the conclusion was, IMO, not befitting of such a masterpiece.

Now that the story is over, we are free."

AoT was such an amazing and grand story that I wanted to love everything about the ending and thought the story deserved such an ending as well. I don’t think it retroactively makes the series worse or destroys Eren’s character, yet a few decisions felt rushed and some mind-boggling. Overall, this series has meant so much to me and what I’ll always take away are the things that I loved about the story, characters, themes, all of it. On a final and more positive note, thanks TF and thanks Isayama for the fun times! I’ll still be waiting for S4P2 when that comes around."
H-K_47,LaotianDude,There was no reason to bring back Jean and Connie.  Some a cheap pull to make chapter 138 more impactful.
H-K_47,Gauntlet2010,"Wait.

So everything in the story happens becouse of Ymir love for the king right? (which is horrible writing, but ok, let's move on)

Then everything gets resolved by Ymir seeing Mikasa kill Eren, which makes her able to move on from her sick love.

But if the Founder has the power to see past, present and future at the same time, why did she need the events to actually take place to undo her powers? Wouldn't she just know from the begining? Damn, the more i think about it and more plot holes i find"

H-K_47,Sir_I_Exist,"I am still pretty confused about the panel where he ""sends"" Dina away from Bert to his mom. Mainly because it is unclear to me how much Eren was able to influence the events that had occurred and were yet to occur. A lot of folks are saying that the AOT timeline is fixed--that these things are fated to happen and cannot be changed. That reinforces the theme that Eren was a slave to destiny even though he pursued freedom.

But if these events were always supposed to happen, how much influence can Eren exert? Was he just ""going with the flow"" or could there have been different outcomes if he had taken a different path?"
H-K_47,Alliseeisgold24,"So basically  Eren just turned Eldia into North Korea, a military  Dictatorship that's basically preparing for war everyday. They went from totalitarianism to a military Dictatorship.

Is it because Mikasa needs to have the ""slave Ymir"" role and Armin needs to have the ""Helos"" role?"
tesseracts,Maevre1,I think it was to get the attention away from Mikasa who just wanted to slip away quietly and give Eren a proper funeral.
tesseracts,jofbaut,"It’s the Lelouch/Suzaku Zero Requiem plan. Eren plays the role of the villain while Armin plays the role of the hero. 

Mikasa’s role was just to convince Ymir that it was possible to truly kill the ones that you love. Despite the mean things that Eren said to her, she didn’t completely succumb to her love for her *and let him live and do whatever he wanted*. Instead Mikasa killed him and put him out of his misery. This is in contrast to Fritz’s treatment of Ymir and Ymir staying dependent and connected to Fritz’s will which resulted in the curse on the Eldian race."

H-K_47,Unknown_Noams,"Eren has always been an awful human being. He has always been aggressive and considers the people who don’t think like him to be no better than cattle. His drive to be “free” has always been towards a very naive notion of the concept. Hence why during the rumbling he appears as a child when he says “freedom” and the freedom in that moment is him committing genocide. 

The original Eldian empire did eliminate all of its enemies and this too was from a drive to be “free”. It’s very reminiscent of what the historian Livy said of Rome: that it “conquered the world in self defense”. Did such bring about peace? No. When left with no enemies to conquer it turned its aggression inward and broke apart to civil war. Such was the fate of Rome and would’ve been the fate of the Third Reich had it not exhausted itself earlier. 

Making Eren out to have these pure intentions seems to be betray his character arc and the history of Eldia. But maybe that’s the point, maybe this is intentionally a very sad and deranged ending. The worlds problems do not begin and end with the Titans. Human beings will always be stuck in a cycle of violence for the sake of freedom - there will always be one enemy left to conquer. As long as there is an “us” vs. “them” (“we” are the hunters and “they” are the prey) the only freedom from these violent impulses is death."
H-K_47,xcdysis,"I’m guessing the whole founding titan operating in both past and future concept and Eren’s thoughts being incoherent is Isayama’a way of hand waving Eren’s change in character throughout the story.

H-K_47,None,"I really enjoy the reveal that eren in reality had influence over the entire course of events in the series. Eren was able to influence Grisha into usurping the founding titan, something that otherwise wouldn’t have happened and later he influenced Dina to kill his mother to prevent Bertolt from dying too soon. It’s as if the entire history has been orchestrated by a greater power that exists in the paths or is the paths itself, in other words Ymir. Eren described unlocking the memories of the founding titan as existing in the past, present and future and given his ability to physically influence individuals across that spectrum, leaving one to wonder what else had been influenced by Eren and or Ymir? Perhaps founding titan Eren/Ymir influenced himself to kill the human traffickers threatening Mikasa because like Bertolt, it was too soon for her to die. The point of this is that if history is orchestrated and the future is clearly laid out then human agency, or at least eldian agency as they are the only ones influenced by Ymir, is impossible because they don’t have the will to deny that laid out future. Eren seems to lament this by noting that the rumbling was inevitable and that nobody wanted to die like him but he had to die. Moreover, if Eren killed his own mother then his entire motivation for wanting to kill the titans is a consequence of his own actions. I think that this is what he meant when he said he didn’t know why he did all that he did, the realization that his life was laid out for him and because of the responsibility of the Founding/attack titan and thus the eldian cause being imposed upon him by his father, he could never be truly free but forever stuck as a pawn to greater powers like the paths. I think Isayama intended something like this within the subtext but the actual text of the past few chapters hasn’t been that good. He really dropped the ball in actually piecing it all together, but the pieces are there."

NOOOOO I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GUYS GOING TO ANOTHER SUB! I WANT TO SHITPOST WITH YOU FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS AT LEAST!"
H-K_47,Ribtickler98,"One of the things bothering me the most is Eren being so deeply in love with Mikasa, to the point that he doesn’t want her to move on after he’s dead. It never really seemed like he had any romantic feelings for her outside of a few moments in the manga/anime. It was painfully obvious she was in love with him, but he never once acted on it lol. Then when it’s too late he starts bitching about her moving on and not being able to be with her."

H-K_47,ragnaroksoon,"Armin literally thanked Eren for him becoming a mass murderer for their sake. this is pure comedy. not only that, but also has one of the biggest character assassination so far. Eren NEVER showed any romantic feelings for M*kasa, but suddenly he is in deep love with her. first asspuIl of love I've ever seen. Ymir's ""character"" is so confuse that not even Isayama bothers to explain. Eren's motivation looked so deep and complex, but turned out to be this utter non sense crap. a guy who can see the past, the future and have godly powers didn't know what he was doing all this time. he did it because ""he felt like"". I really don't understand why Isyama did this. how can he deliver such a f4nfic tier as the last chapter. he wanted to hurt his fans, and I hope he is happy, because he managed to do it. in the worst way possible."
H-K_47,Oposo,I can't stress enough how disguisting it is that Isayama made Ymir be in love with Fritz.
H-K_47,thenameisjul,"After reading the English version, i really liked the ending. The leak summaries didn't do it justice and I feel like most people just hate on it because the leaks thread was a fucking echo chamber and no one really thought about the ending itself.

Eren was from chapter 1 the one who was willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. He was a naive blockhead. The manbun rumbling chad eren was never his true self. After the ceremony scene, he saw the memories from the future and he thought that it was the only way to save his friends. If we look back on eren after the kids, we can clearly see that what we thought was determination was really just depression and the fact that he had already given up and given in to his fate. He didn't try to talk to his friends because he didn't want to hurt them and he didn't want to be seen as weak. I think if you read the whole manga in one go, the ending will fit a lot more nicely than waiting for months to read leaks and having to listen to reddit tell you how bad it was before you even read it yourself."
H-K_47,None,People are like just re-read the chapter it gets better. This is my 6th time reading it and it’s still trash

H-K_47,None,"Maybe it is because of the traumatic spoilers but I am numb now and chapter seems okay.Eren wanted to be killed so that it could be proven to rest of the world that people of Paradis are good people.

Armin was supposed ro be savior of humanity.

Eren gives the reason why he did rumbling in the initial panels but towards the ending he said he did it for no reason. There is talk of everyone should be eliminated and we should fight while simultaneously peace talks are going on.Looks like an anything can happen ending.(Caters to both doombros and alliancebros)  


Plothole: Ackermans memories cant be modified, so Mikasa should have remembered what Eren was trying to do."

H-K_47,Gshiinobi,"Everyone in aot gloryfing Eren as this tragic saviour because he had a talk with them really rubs me the wrong way, everyone forgives him and forgets about all the awful shit he did so fast and it just doesn't feel right.


I really can't believe ""Eren thank you for becoming a mass murderer for our sake"" and ""Eren what a man you are for sacrificing yourself for everyone"" are real lines from the characters said in the manga and not r/titanfolk jokes..."
H-K_47,VeloKa,"Honestly with context the ending was way better than how the leaks explained.

People were compalining that world peace can't be achieved and here we are, it wasn't, it's just the begining.

Eren didn't gamble Paradise future he made sure they have a chance to stand in a fight. 

The major problem here is Genocide maybe getting a bit of a green light."
H-K_47,rhetoric_trex,"Reading the chapter now I think it's....not as bad as leaks made it out to be (shocker I know). But it's still barely a 6/10. A lot of potential was lost imo.

I don't care about the father theories but I would've at least like for the farmer to have a face and a name (at least give him the Niccolo treatment, why all the mystery?). And I would've also liked if we got the kids name. It would've been so much more impactful if at the end Historia called out to her kid and said ""Ymir your birthday cake is ready!"" or something like that cause then there would be some emotional payoff.

The other thing I'll mention is that I really like the idea of Eren having a crippling pyshosis due to the overload of information the founding titan gave him. So much potential but I felt Isayama didn't properly portray it? Sure you could argue 131 showed this but I still don't think it was developed enough. It felt too sudden. Idk how you could go about it I'm not a writer but this definitely had the potential to go all weird and lovecraftian and even lead to an Evangelion-esque ending but alas. Eren was a tragic character and I really liked the idea presented here but I felt the execution was a bit off. 

I also felt Eren's send-off was rushed. I wish we got 2 chapters for the ending. One where Eren talks to the Armin and the alliance explaining his burden and his plan with the payoff of ending the titans and then the epilogue that goes deeper in the world-building aspect. Again potential lost here.

Of course there is other nitpicks like Ymir's love for Fritz (wtf?) and the way to quick to forgive Eren alliance but whatever those are more nitpicks, I could go on forever with these.

Overall after 123, I never really felt that same sense of excitement and ""oh shit that makes sense"" that this series has provided in its previous arcs. Overall I give the series an 8/10. Amazing story overall with a not so great last arc that lost a lot of potential."
H-K_47,Rodranime,Levi's last line was literally Shinzou Wo Sasageyo
H-K_47,_toewi,"S1-S3: Eren is boring

S4: Whoa Eren finally has some personality

Last chapter: fuck"
H-K_47,Kingofpop01,"The ending was definitely rushed, but a lot of the points people complain about are not that bad IMO:

* **""Zeke died for nothing""**: Zeke wanted to euthanize the entire eldian race in order for the titan power to disappear. Eren thought of that as cruel because he did not his own folk to be stripped of the option of having children and having their freedom being taken away. And about his death, I mean, he was one of the two pieces necessary for the rumbling to continue, so if he wasn't killed at that point, the remaining 20% would have been killed too. So he sacrificed himself which saved millions of lives. Could he have done it earlier? Well, Eren wanted his friends to be considered the heroes of humanity in order to be respected by the rest of the world. So he waited for them to arrive and kill himself + Zeke. So the 80% died because they couldn't get there faster. 
* **""Eren, thanks for becoming a mass murderer for us""**: Sounds dogshit, but might be a translation error. Guys, this was the initial translation, lets wait a little bit..
*  **""Yeagerist vs World still going on, rumbling did not help.""** : As far as I have understood, the 104 recruits haven't come back since the last fight, so the yeagerists have not quite the idea of everything that happened. Kinda normal that they continued to behave like they did when the rumbling started. Armin and the crew have built good connections with the rest of the world and come back in order to reach some kind of peace. Will conflict still exist? Of course, its in humanities nature, just as it was stated in the manga. But at least now, the rest of the world, won't have to fear the power of the titans which could flatten the earth again so Eldians won't feared -> gangbanged by the rest of the world for having the potential power to end the world. They are just another country now. 
* **""Hallu-chan went poof lmao""**:  levi said that in order for the centipede to die, Eren had to die without transferring the founding titan. Eren died and so did the fucking worm.
* **""Why did Eren want to flatten the earth regardless?""**: He did not want to kill anyone, even outside of the wall, but he was kind of forced into it, because the rest of the world declared war on Paradis, so ""kill or be killed"". His options for that problem was either show humanity the power of the rumbling and be considered the ultimate bad guy until his comrades come and kill him in front of the allied nations -> power of the titans disappears and armin and co will be considered the heroes who saved the rest of the world -> these heroes mediate some type of peace with the allied nations and some type of peace is ensured. OR just fuck the rest of the world entirely cuz they will never cease to hate/try to kill eldians cuz the rumbling is too dangerous -> fuck' em all and just leave Eldians on earth. He went for Option 1. It took way too many sacrifices but atleast there were some millions left alive. Could he have just killed himself and let armin etc negotioate peace before the rumbling? Don't think so, cuz the rest of the world wouldn't give a fuck about what eldians would say and kill them anyways. 

***Things that did not make sense:*** 

* Mikasa just tp'ed across the ocean with Eren's rotting head
* Why did Grisha give Eren his power when he was against his plan (Zeke Grisha interaction in paths)
* Ymir being a cum dumpster for fritz cuz of love. 
* Historia's kid not being named Ymir cuz it would've been perfect. Yams, cmon m8.
* Eren going back to a little bitch in the last chapter. Made my edge boner go soft. Should've stayed a freedom chad. But everybody has emotions and these talks with his friends might have been like small therapy sessions in which he kind of needed to vent off his emotions which he couldn't show IRL cuz the future he planned couldn't have been realized."
H-K_47,dicecop,"I have to admit, the chapter wasn't as bad as I anticipated. It hit me in the feels towards the end. But the fact that several plot points were just ignored reminds me of the wasted potential of Tokyo Ghoul, albeit better as it didn't feel obviously chopped. Though I dunno why it was necessary to relegate Reiner to some closet pervert as well as Might Guying Levi. 

The one thing that I'm genuinely pleased by is knowing that Floch didn't die in vain. He did what he believed in, riled up the masses and the formation of the Yeagerist faction and ideology will forever remain his legacy. A true revolutionary and heroic patriot. 

Guess I misunderstood the final arc. I genuinely believed that Eren was gonna be this great mastermind protag that we've all been waiting for, but unfortunately his arc didn't turn out as impressive as I hoped. Nevertheless, the journey makes up for the ending imo, so it's a 9/10 for me. Well done Isayama, thanks for this awesome series and good luck with your onsen."
H-K_47,Proxy_of_Death,"I am rereading Eren and Armin's conversation and I am laughing.

When Armin said ""So you became a mass murderer for our sake"" I almost thought he was trolling. LOL.

Armin's smirk when he wanted Eren to be jealous is hilarious.

He just told you he will kill 80% of the world's population including children and women. Hahaha.

""No, I don't want that, I want her to think about me and no one else for the rest of my life.""

""Even if I die, I want to be at the front of her mind for a while. _10 years at least._""  LMAO."
H-K_47,robo243,"This chapter left me feeling like an empty shell, I felt nothing for any of the characters. Years of theory-crafting went down the fucking shithole. I would write all the major plot holes in this chapter but I'm too lazy to do that right now (might make a post about it later). Not only this, but I can't even enjoy the best parts of this series anymore (Reiss cavern stuff, Return to Shinganshina arc, Reiner flashbacks, Zeke flashbacks, chapters 119-123, 127, 130-134 and even 138) without being reminded of this lackluster finale. And before some dickhead comes in here to accuse me of not liking the ending simply because ""mY hEaDcAnNoN dIdN't CoMe TrUe"" I will only tell you this: I don't take sides when I read stories, I would've been fine with either the Alliance winning or Eren winning as long as the execution was done right and made sense and as long as the questions and mysteries that were set up in the final arc were given proper answers that didn't feel like ass-pulls (like the result of Mikasa's choice being the end of the Titans)."
H-K_47,Slaiden_IV,"Were there ever any indications of Eren being in love with Mikasa really? Like okay if you tell me Mikasa loved Eren that would make sense, but Eren never ever showed any such indication and what he says to Armin about Mikasa finding someone else just makes no sense from Eren's perspective."
H-K_47,msizzle344,"I just wanted an ending that answered some questions, but instead got one that asks a million more. So am I understanding this correctly:

1. Eren using the founding Titan would go back in time and manipulate events, all whilst having conversations with his friends before wiping their memories?

2. Eren never really a clue on how things would end, he basically bluffed when he told Zeke he “saw what would happen and how sweet it was” and really just used the rumbling because he figured that was the best way to all of humanity to be able to forgive eldians if they killed him (lol?).

3. Confident reassured Eren was all a facade, dude is still as unsure of himself as he always was.

4. So we have 2000 years of Titans and endless amounts of suffering because Ymir couldn’t get over her toxic relationship with the King and basically needed Mikasa to kill Eren to show the error in her ways and poof! Titans gone? How does this make sense? I think this is the most egregious offense in the ending. That it basically renders Titans and its mysticism to a woman who basically felt guilty for loving a cruel person and couldn’t move on from that fact and decided not to do anything about it.

5. Historia was just used as a plot device post-time skip. Pretty much holds no significance besides her title and Eren’s defense of her was just..idk for no reason.

On top of these 5 points, you have basically a number of other plot holes open. Why didn’t Eren just control titans and manipulate himself into a better situation from the beginning? Why was Eren so sure the rumbling was key, but then not really sure at the end of the manga? 

I just don’t understand really what the thought process is. If you look at the ending from the outside without looking at the details:
-Titan curse over
-104th able to live long lived (Sasha ;()
-Eldians are now in nearly equal standing with the rest of the world
- Eren sacrifices himself for Eldia

Not terrible, but when you look deeper into it and WHY everything came to be it makes no sense. Could’ve just had Eren talk to Armin and come off as this sage like person who had all the answers, instead of a kid who doesn’t know if what he’s doing will resolve anything. That would make the ending a bunch better. I don’t mind he cared for Mikasa, even if it’s out of left field, but he could’ve framed the conversation as him saying “Hey, I looked into other avenues, this was the only way to secure everyone’s survival, it had to be done” and that would be infinitely better.

And don’t make Ymir the trigger to the end of the curse, what I had expected at even its most basic was that they’d have to destroy Hallu-Chan and the curse would be over, but Eren was playing mind games to make sure Hallu-Chan would appear. That would make ending the curse better than just Ymir being like “ok yea, that’s what I needed to see. *snap”.


Overall, I have a great love for the series and I still think this ending despite its shittiness, isn’t the worst case imaginable. The journey was still great even if I think the story peaked between 119-123. Everything else before then was fantastic, the rumbling arc was just pretty bad overall, exacerbated by how awful it all came together in the end"

H-K_47,None,People saying the bird is Eren... it's just some random bird looking for worms in Mikasas scarf as it has never been washed.
H-K_47,Luf2222,"the more and more i reread this and other chapters, i‘m coming more to the conclusion that somebody else influenced isayama or had his hands in the final chapter (and maybe a few previous chapters) 

it doesn‘t feel like it was written by the same isayama who wrote the rest of AoT, but more like he for example wrote 50% of this chapter and somebody else wrote the last 50% or something like that, i really think his editor or somebody else had his hands in this."
H-K_47,None,"Ok here’s the only way I can think of this that makes sense: This wasn’t Eren, but the attack Titan itself guiding all these actions.

The attack Titan always yearned for freedom (specifically for Ymir) so it orchestrated all this so it could get her away from King Fritz.

Eren was basically just along for the ride. He could see the future but he was powerless to change it. Thinking like Dr Manhattan “I am just a puppet who can see the strings”.

I like this explanation because it also fits in one of the themes that, none of these characters are actually special. They were just in the right place at the right time.


I’ll also say that a lelouch “world peace achieved” ending would have been the worst possible ending to me."
H-K_47,TheThirdGilgamesh,"When we saw the title, from you, 2000 years ago, it was referring to Mikasa all along... when she was not even in the chapter and Eren was the one breaking Ymir free. People who think chapter 139 is great are on some high quality copium."

These were probably the most accurate leaks ever lol everything that leaked was in the chapter 1:1

Is it the art that helps?"
H-K_47,Inferno792,"An advice for you guys, coming from personal experience:

Never get attached to a fictional series. It fucking hurts."
H-K_47,GoudaTanaka,"I can't understand how people see eren destroying 80% of the population with the rumbling, Stating he was right to do so, Stating he would go 100% if Mikasa didn't kill him, Stating he literally **killed his own mom** to achieve this. 

And then go ''he is a ruined simp incel'' cause the teenager broke down to his best friend at his final moments after being told the girl he grew up might someday forget him, Then literally a second later apologized and retracted his statement."
H-K_47,Spaghestis,"Wow I just realized,

Armin defending the Eldians from the Marleyan soldiers by talking is a parallel to Trost Arc when he did the same exact thing for Eren:

Soldiers are pointing guns at the Eldians, ready to fire

Muller asks them ""Are you human or are you titan"", literally the same exact wording as Trost

Armin steps forward and defends them, defusing the situation

This chapter gets better the more you read it tbh"
H-K_47,Spaghestis,"Man the ending is more realistic than more people think:

The Alliance members and their families got hunted down by the Jagerists until Historia ordered them to stop

Most of the world is struggling for food but the militarist Jaegerists are sending occupying forces to try and prevent another war

Eren, a mentally ill teenager, had a breakdown before dying instead of being calm. Light's death in Death Note is one of my favorite parts of the manga and this definitely seems to be inspired by that

The Marleyans still dont trust the Eldians


Definitely better than the world peace ending many were expected, and better than titanfolk's ending where Eren was on Paradis and lives happily ever after with Historia as the rest of the world is destroyed"
H-K_47,Aresviel,why the FUCK will Ymir love King Fritz. I mean there's many things I could pinpoint but this shines the most. The leaks turned out true but the way they were written made it better for me. But Ymir loving King Fritz? what the actual fuck

H-K_47,ani091,"I think some people are over thinking the Ymir-Mikasa thing so it seems more complicated than it is. Ymir wanted to see someone like Mikasa have the strength to say goodbye to the person they love. Mikasa killed Eren even though she loves him, which freed Ymir. That’s how I see it."
H-K_47,ATMnmd,"I liked the ending overall. Levi talking to the scouts in the smoke was the strongest part of the chapter. Actually, the entire side cast carried the chapter. Eren and Armin’s conversation could’ve been a lot better though."

H-K_47,SuperSprocket,"I mean it's no masterpiece, but endings are often a weakpoint of even the best writers.

H-K_47,Proxy_of_Death,"Never liked the idea of Eren killing his mother.

1. Because I think his relationship with his mother should be one thing that is special to Eren and at least should be that way. That there is this special mother-child born that even an unhinged Eren will hold sacred. He will never cross that line. Carla's love for him and her death defined him. 

2. This bootstrap paradox(before someone says it is all fixed so it isn't a paradox, I used to argue that too) has been used too much. Grisha was fine at least for the first time. 

3. If Eren ever wielded a power that transcends time, influence both past, present and future surely he can do better than just kill billions of people to achieve this outcome. Dr Strange? Steins Gate?"

Eren: Then it's an even weirder question to ask me, maybe you should find someone you like and ask him.

Historia: I have another question... how do you feel about your relationship with Mikasa?

Eren: Oh... that's a difficult question to answer. The truth is, I've always found her really pretty, but she's far too codependent. I wish it didn't have to be this way, but I have actually been trying to push her away for a long time. It doesn't work, she's always clinging on to me though. Please don't tell anyone I said this, it's very awkward.

Historia: Wow. Don't take this the wrong way but, I feel kind of glad to hear that.

H-K_47,Special_Peanut,"My 2 cents : People made Eren out to be this chad who knows exactly what he’s doing. 

When in reality to me, it just looked like he was hella depressed and trying to convince himself that moving forward with the predestined outcome is the only way. 

Like in the Tatakae scene, he wasn’t being a badass, he was just strengthening his resolve. It’s obvious he was never sure of anything he was doing.

Eren was never going to be a chad and that’s totally fine! If you expected a selfless whiny kid to make a 180 and become a criminal mastermind, that’s on you. The fact that he’s still the same deep down isn’t character assassination."

H-K_47,rally2mee,Wait...did eren take Mikasa memories as well? Did I read that right? How? She's an ackermen.
H-K_47,RekklesCami,Felt sad for Mikasa at the end. She got the least happy ending
H-K_47,reeposterr,"Pretty average ending. Though, I wish the ending could have been different, but it is what it is. It has been a wild ride."
H-K_47,sharethebear1,"So Mikasa's dream last chapter was probably her Eren visit, then. That explains how she knew where he was."
H-K_47,ErenJaeger88,"Idk I guess I'll just share my opinion on some of the characters..
Historias character was finished in the uprising arc already so sidelining her was not that big of a deal but still kind of annoying how he kept the whole pregnancy thing going..idk. I also think it's lame no one died ? Like characters the reader had a relation with? Reiner should've sacrificed himself, I really don't like how unimportant he got post like 104, I wished for him to be waaaay more important since Isayama laid out such an amazing character dynamic between him and Eren since all the way back in Clash of Titans. Zeke is a god tier character, no doubt about it, I loved his ending. Levi and Erwin are very good too. I expected too much from Armin but the parallel in 139 all the way back to when he saved Eren and Mikasa from the canons in Trost was kinda heartwarming. Erens character WAS changed but that doesn't take away what happened in 91-123 he is still the goat but him begging for mikasa to love him and only him is weird was definitely not needed. Why not just make him confess to armin in a normal way ? Would've been way better."
H-K_47,justanotheeredditor,"Not gonna lie, I am having the time of my life re reading youtube comments how everyone is praising the shit out of the foreshadowing and stuff. Everything aged so badly"
H-K_47,tiour,"Hmmm. It’s not as bad as I first thought. This chapter makes it clear that it was either rushed, or yams was just done. So many plot holes tho. Maybe he will tidy up things in the anime (although that’s just the hopium talking)."
H-K_47,None,[deleted]
H-K_47,its_h12,"#When it comes to Historia’s child, Eren... you are not the father

^I’m ^sad"
H-K_47,Disonance,"This was possibly my favorite manga that I've read to date, I read it in high school and became an adult in university while reading this story. I'm personally disappointed that this is the ending we got, but I'm not sure we deserved a perfect or even a good ending in the first place. I suppose it could have been a lot worse than this, but 12 years of this and for what? To end like this? It just seems to cruel to be real. A bittersweet ending I suppose this is what we deserved. 10/10 story 0/10 ending for me.

I will keep moving forward, that's what Eren would want us to do if he was real even though Isayama had him choose this path he would want everyone who cared for him to fight and live free so that's what I plan to do. Susume my soldiers susume. For the final time friends lets dedicate our hearts. Shinzou wo sasegayo titanfolk.

It's been a blast and an awesome ride, and this is just the beginning of all of our own adventures. Maybe one day Isayama will return with a new chapter or sequel, maybe even perhaps an alternative ending who knows. Take care all of you wonderful people and don't forget how great this story was, don't let the ending sour your minds and create hate or despair. We where born into this world and we are free so tatakae."
H-K_47,Junnyy,"Well, like a lot of people, I'm disappointed with how nothing was answered but I think the message here is that humans will always fight each other and there won't be an end to it but it is just what we are. The fact that 80% of the world had to be wiped out, otherwise Paradis would have been destroyed is pretty telling by itself.

In a sense, Eren had completed his goal of wiping out all Titans, and imo his friends were always his top priority alongside his desire to rid off the Titan powers, so it made sense that what he did was for them (The explanation could have improved for sure). Paradis has been put in a position of equal footing with the rest of the world and the way that was achieved is pretty brutal.

Regarding the Titan powers, I assume Ymir was the one that wiped it out? They should have went into more detail but what I got was through witnessing Mikasa's love and her choice to let go, Ymir was able to let go of her love for King Fritz and finally be free from Paths, meaning the Titan powers disappeared without anyone making them. It feels a bit out of place tbh and I wished they had a few more panels on it at least.

I had a feeling a few chapters ago that the ending will be open ended because who can realistically solve this conflict? No one can and the author does not necessarily have to explain every little detail in their story, they rarely do.

It was a good ride, I enjoyed the hell out of Attack on Titan and will enjoy the anime next year as well. The ending has left a lot to be desired but ultimately, I think I can live with it.

I rate this chapter 5.5/10 but this is still the manga/anime that got me into reading any manga or watching any anime and I loved it."
H-K_47,GMFan8,Ellen becomes dove (crying) but for real. What is this.
H-K_47,None,"I'm free. It was a good ride titanfolk, I can finally leave this sub."
H-K_47,sharethebear1,"Farmer chads, rise up. We were right all along."
H-K_47,ReadyForKenny,So Ymir just fucking disappeared???? What the fuck
H-K_47,Oposo,"That panel with Eren crying that Mikasa will ''find and love another man'' broke the series for me.

I want seppuku"
H-K_47,Electronic___Ad,"And people try and tell me that the Original Tokyo Ghoul's ending would be beaten by this lol.

Nothing will ever surpass Tokyou Kushus ending. Nothing.

It's not bad imo, just not a masterpiece of an ending like the first half of TG had."
H-K_47,Unable-Mechanic-7473,Why did grisha tell eren he was free if he knew eren was going to become a slave to fate? I mean thats what happened right? Eren was a slave to completing the rumbling and became a martyr for paradis
H-K_47,Mundane_Resource2674,"Zeke was right.

The Eldians did all deserve to lose their PP."
H-K_47,Historiawaifu,"I've been here in titanfolk since the day it was created, it's been an honor folks, we are free. o7"
H-K_47,prominencefracx,only Falco in a Turtleneck made this chapter readable
H-K_47,nyoomkaty,"So apparently Armin was the father? Cause that baby looks just the fuck like him.

Edit: Though in seriousness, was it ACTUALLY Farmer-kun? That’s good stuff."
H-K_47,Chopperz19,Worm: Adios
H-K_47,None,"I just remembered, wtf was up with Yams’ comment that the ending “is only the beginning?” Was he just alluding to ending at the tree?"
H-K_47,zacmario66,I feel like Isayama had a totally different ending but he had to or just decided to change it for some reason. How could you read 130-131 and just think this was Eren’s thought process.
H-K_47,Koopaaking,Sooooooo....worm just went poof?
H-K_47,Talos404,"""Why was my mom eaten by a titan, Reiner?""

"".....Because-""

""Jk it was me lmao""

""NaNi?!"""
H-K_47,raining-in-konoha,Doesn't matter if we liked or disliked it. We are free.
H-K_47,Shadowlinkrulez,"Would’ve vastly preferred an alliance win but Titans get disintegrated, with jean eating pieck + gabi eating Reiner. But this still isn’t the worst, thank god it wasn’t the timeloop thing at the very least(which never really made sense)"
H-K_47,ani091,I understand why Historia was sidelined now. Isayama really isn’t a fan of the Yeagerists and Historia is more pro-genocide than Eren and even maybe Floch. Isayama couldn’t kill her because she had to rule the new Paradis but he still didn’t like her so he just minimized her screen time.
H-K_47,boboafett1,Levi....... I just want you hug you man.
H-K_47,LeoPhoenix93,So did the worm just leave back to its home after its plot arc was over?
H-K_47,Qkb,"The chapter feels out of place. Anyone have any manga recommendations to fill the void?

I’m reading One Room of Happiness and it’s pretty good. Not exactly like AoT, but it’s pretty dark and very twisty"
H-K_47,louweezerz,The only REAL pain rn is that once we get the whole thing animated there’s nothing left.... :C
H-K_47,coolj492,Endings are hard
H-K_47,VoidFroid,"I feel like the ""thank you for becoming a mass murderer for our sake"" line as it is really throws you off,  is there any chance that ""devil"" could be an accurate translation too? it would make sense tematically (e.g Erwin) and imo would read more natural"
H-K_47,graysalman,so hange was the only person that thinks genocide/omnicide is bad. guess she died for nothing
H-K_47,Mxteor,"i mean, i guess eren wiped out all the titans like he promised in ep1?"
H-K_47,G_Riel_,"I was expecting trash, but not this chapter."
H-K_47,5437354724,I'm starting to think Historia really did ask Eren to erase her memories. It makes too much sense.
H-K_47,kinglebron10,"Now that AOT ended here are my recommendations:

Logh (anime), Vinland saga (manga/anime), Bokutachi ga yarimashita (manga), Chainsaw man (manga), Monogatari (Anime), Ping pong the animation(anime)"
H-K_47,cenasfodetepah,so... very funny yams but when is the real chapter gonna drop?
H-K_47,xcdysis,Why does Armin and Eren randomly start talking about Mikasa’s love life after Eren anyway... The story never built them up for it in the first place. It’s so out of character for Eren to beg for her to love him after death.
H-K_47,seixas_xx,"So...is Eren alive in paths or something? I really liked the ending overall, just didn't get that bird picking her scarf at the end."
H-K_47,zethus301,"maybe the real shinge-...


nah... nevermind"
H-K_47,victor01134,So many plot holes and questions un answers.
H-K_47,None,"Wait, so eren spoke to everyone right??"
None,ColloquialAnachron,"Yep. He locked those memories until after his death, but what we get from Connie and others tells us Eren gave each of them a message for after he was dead. So, he told Connie his mom would be human again, told all of them to live long lives, etc. 

We just only get to see the one with Armin."
H-K_47,None,"That bird isn’t Eren you donkeys it’s symbolic of how death brought him freedom

EDIT: y’all realize that armin-bird scene happens 3 years apart, on a different continent, from the mikasa-bird scene, right? 

No. Eren did not turn into a bird, spend 3 years flying across the ocean, reach paradise, and bite a scarf.

EDIT EDIT: AND NO. THE PRESENCE OF BIRDS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ERENS GHOST IS NEARBY. I DIDNT ENJOY 10TH GRADE ENGLISH EITHET BUT GOD DAMN PICK UP THE SCARLET LETTER YOU ANIMALS.

EDIT EDIT EDIT: come on. Eren said that he doesn’t want to die and he wishes he could stay. He didn’t say “I shall remain living alongside you in the form of any and all birds” lol 

EDIT: you know what? Fuck it. You guys are so right. Eren became a shapeshifting birdomancer in the last issue. He redistributed his consciousness like Reiner did. But where Reiner moved his around his body, Eren moved his into birds. 

Fuck that shit I said about how birds are used throughout the series to symbolize freedom. And how, in death, Eren is finally free. No, y’alls theory that Eren can suddenly psychically controls birds and sends visions through them makes more sense. 

Fuck y’all that’s the ending you deserve."
H-K_47,Lordlinkoftime2,WE SAW RICO LETS GOOOOOOOOO
H-K_47,scroobydoops,All the soldiers of the survey corps died... for this? Fuck that shit. The fact that they dedicated their hearts for nothing feels like a knife in the chest. This sucks major ass.
H-K_47,None,[removed]
H-K_47,None,"Eren should’ve just stayed in his own lane and done nothing because he literally made everything WORSE. Screwed his government, caused a mini civil war in Paradis,ruined any chance of peace talks with Liberio, killed billions of people and fucked over Mikasa. I still don’t understand Eren’s motivation, why not have Dina eat Bertholdt and end the cycle of Titans back then?  He screwed Paradis by cementing the outside worlds hatred too. Ymir character was also assassinated.... other than that... the chapter was alright, epilogue was surprisingly good, Gabi suplexing Falco was godly and the Levi scene was great."
H-K_47,None,Honestly I think is a masterstroke of tragedy. I really liked it despite crying through it the whole way. I realize I'm one opinion out of everyone but just giving my thoughts
H-K_47,IrisRainbowz,"I wasn't even on the ""Eren should end the world"" side and I'm still disappointed."
H-K_47,brenguyeno,"Can someone please tell me what the conclusion of Mikasa's arc was? I like her character, I truly do and defended her character a lot, but the ending is perplexing. Does she not move on from Eren? Was it she obtained the freedom to never forget Eren? 

I'm really confused. I thought that this entire arc was building up for Mikasa to finally move on and live a life for herself, but it feels strange to see her abandon her friends (Armin, Connie, Jean) and live a solemn, lonely life."
H-K_47,AWarlock86,Bro Gabi actually just fucking annihilated Falco
H-K_47,Ikea_Man,"**IT'S BEEN AN HONOR BOYS**

**EREN WAS A BIRD ALL ALONG, I KNEW IT**"
H-K_47,None,I liked the discussion we had together and spamming was certainly fun but I honestly don’t really like this chapter.
H-K_47,sopersonicsnail,I like how everyone is ok with genocide but ymir fritz abusive relationship is a dealbreaker lol
H-K_47,Standard-Special2013,"We gotta interview the mods of their experience on April the 7th.

How did they manage the tens of thousands of comments and 6 posts a minute"
H-K_47,WilliShaker,"Personnally a dark ending where all the eldians titans would just collapse and die while the rest pf humanity is too hurt from the rumbling to attack for Paradis and since they know Paradis has no titans anymore and isn’t hurt by the rumbling, they just let it slide.

I think it would be more logical than what we got. Tbh I would have preferred one with Eren dying but winning."
H-K_47,ElMondoH,"I'm confused now... Ymir had 4 daughters and a son? 

Not an important detail, I know - especially next to that whole bomb about loving him (seems more like Stockholm Syndrome, right?) - but it still feels off. 

God, I hate complaining about this. It's the last freakin' chapter, ever. I want to be celebrating right now."
H-K_47,alexitimio,It was...an ending
H-K_47,BlazingJames,This is not based at all
H-K_47,harisaashraf7,Eren doesn't want any man near mikasa for atleast ten years. Jean better go for pieck then.
H-K_47,Accelerator657,"I don't get how the Lelouch ending was even possible. It worked in Code Geass because, well you know, Lelouch didn't kill 80% of humanity. How does this work out? In a 100 or 200 years, when the population stabilizes, they'll probably hate Paradis. Just continuing the cycle of hatred. Ellen became dove, I wonder if Isayama added that in for the meme. I doubt it, but I can hope."
H-K_47,MMDroxy,It just really hit me that Eren is dead. Man that’s so sad. I might get emotional when they animate this.
H-K_47,None,i find it so funny how the alliance did all this for peace just for historia and yeagerists to continue war
H-K_47,smoked___salmon,Eren is wish.com Lelouch now.
H-K_47,obxsguy,"I'm kind of curious what Eren's conversation was like with Annie. The last time they interacted directly was during the fight in Stohess, right?"
H-K_47,NotTreblinka,So that rumored final panel was just Grisha and Eren
H-K_47,Kips420,"For everyone asking why Eren even had to do the rumbling, imagine if he hadn't done it

Imagine he just took away the power of titans from eldia , which was feared by the world for those titan powers. Eldians would be left defenseless and would have been wiped out if not for the rumbling.

Eren cared more about his friends than the whole world so he wipes out 80% of humanity so that eldians can have a chance at negotiating , else they would have been at war and got wiped out immediately

The only thing I can't make sense of in the ending is the bird thing."

H-K_47,fsuhoodie,so....... ellen became dove(crying)?
H-K_47,daxuded,So does chapter 1 opening panels correlate to 138 aaron or 139? Does that mean if eren dies without solving titan curse he got sent back to chapter 1? The only time he didnt is 139 where worm kun completely dies? How did worm kun died anyway? And i dont even want to ask on why mikasa is the one ymir wait for 2000 years unless 122 was subvert expectation red herring.
H-K_47,PM-Me-Cute-Cats,Wait what the fuck happened to all the wall titans after everyone was detitanized??
H-K_47,nomnomnomuup686,"Ellen become dove...



Crying"
H-K_47,lovjeej000,Sorry but i found an answer to why Grisha gave Eren the AT after he said he saw a terrible future. Eren erased those memories from his dad’s after the Zeke Grisha hug.
H-K_47,_toewi,I have no problems with becoming the « main enemy » but it could have been handled so much better. This ending doesn’t feel satisfying at all...
H-K_47,None,Let it be known that I was here on this day
H-K_47,prominencefracx,Paths Eren is the best Eren and we all know that
H-K_47,Scruffbo,"i don’t hate this ngl, this unofficial translation seems a bit awkward in places but i say i’m more positive than negative towards the chap. 

sure AnR would be dark and shocking but this is fine, paradis is deffo the strongest in the world still, but peace isn’t guaranteed, no more titans etc. 

it’s not awful, just not great, i agree that some things feel rushed tho, maybe it’ll be more fleshed out in the anime if they remove certain teeth brushing scenes and can focus on a more satisfying ending lol"
H-K_47,Nihill98,I didn't get the whole eren sending the titan to eat his mom. How does that connect to armin and bertholt not dying
H-K_47,None,WHAT DID I JUST READ KDJSIWSJXNN

H-K_47,TurbTheCurb,"Alright well the last 10 chapters mostly just left me scratching my head so I kinda gave up on the story and have instead decided to focus on the little things that make me happy for this chapter. Pieck lives, so all is well.

Also, no alternate reality ending/“it was all a dream” or time loop back to the first chapter"
H-K_47,orandeddie,I don’t know man I’m not satisfied but not disappointed it’s in the between. I don’t know

H-K_47,mydckisvrysmol,"Its deff better with the art but still leaves me unsatisfied with the answers we got. The whole Dina twist is just kinds brushed off & unexplored, late game reveals to some of the questions just leave more questions to ask.

H-K_47,lettuce_sy,"I'll process all the plot holes and shit later. But as I was reading it and finally came to the end, I felt a sense of relief. I was really kind of nervous how this was all going to end. I was really hoping for something at least a little bit happier. My initial feelings about the whole thing was that I think this was as satisfying as it could feasibly be. I'm not saying it's perfect but I do like it a lot. 7 years with this manga has made me very sentimental to it HAHA. What a ride it had been."
H-K_47,TheWhopper265,So the final panel was a lie?

H-K_47,GilgaMesz,Disappointing.
H-K_47,marxoneey,So in the end Eren didn't clap the royal cheeks damn.
H-K_47,None,It made me feel nothing
H-K_47,Demetriade,"Well boys, I reckon this is it. o7"
H-K_47,Eyelikeyourname,"Bizzare is all I have to say. Eren is just a ripoff Lelouch. Even Lelouch did not massacre 80% of the population of the world. If Eren loved Mikasa so much, then he should have confessed to her instead of asking her this question out of the blue and freaking her out. All of this massacre was dependant on that poor girl's choice? Eren ""Mr Freedom"" Yeager, does not want Mikasa to move on and have a good life? Why should she mourn you forever Eren? 

&#x200B;

Remember how in season 1, there was a man named Kitz Weilman. He freaked out when Eren had transformed into a titan. He asked Eren the same question as Muller, ""Are you a human or a titan."" Armin tried to talk no jutsu him, but he failed! Kitz was about to blow EMA up and they were saved because Pixis arrived at that moment. Then how on earth did Armin's talk work on Muller, a Marleyan? Its an even worse situation than the one with Kitz. Eren has just massacred 80% population on the earth, and people are still willing to listen to Armin, when his talk no jutsu didn't even work on Kitz in season 1?

&#x200B;

Why did Historia even get pregnant? She could have just hidden herself like Eren had suggested in chapter 130. Why did he even tell her of his plan? Why did she ask Eren about his opinion on her bearing a child? This conversation seems incomplete. Why did Historia even need this man's permission to bear a child, if she wanted to? Why didn't she just get married to the farmer and lie about her due date? This pregnancy plot was just nonsense. Why did she marry farmer during the timeskip and not earlier? Why does Historia's child look like Hitch? Why was she sidelined after having a whole arc dedicated to her development? 

&#x200B;

How was Eren going around manipulating memories anyway? He could not use the founding titan's full powers without coming in contact with a royal titan. Mikasa said to Armin ""Your memories have returned too, haven't they?"" Didn't Kenny's grandpa tell him in season 3 that Ackermans are immune to memory manipulation? That was why they were being persecuted. How did Eren achieve this?

&#x200B;

Eren was the reason for his mother's death. Its fucked up but I can still understand if its a fixed timeline. But then why did he ask Reiner why his mother died that day? Did he erase his own memories lmao. I rooted for Armin when he punched him this chapter.

&#x200B;

How did the world recover this much in only three years? We saw London being stomped but in the end it looked fine. Why is the world ok with the eldians after getting wiped out almost completely? Armin's talk no jutsu is too op now. Paradis was taken over by the Yeagerists and is preparing an army? So the monsters wiped out most of the world population, and might even attack them now? Historia mentioned in her letter that ""This fight won't end until either the Eldians or the whole world is wiped out"". There will always be conflict. 

&#x200B;

Historia is protecting Jean and Connie's families. The alliance lives outside Paradis now. Armin is still relying on talk no jutsu. We saw how much the people of Paradis love their devil, Eren. Why wouldn't they be pissed at the alliance? The titan powers have been wiped out, but its still so fucked up. Kiyomi will get her resources after all. Her kindness resulted in profit for her. Eren should have just gone with Zeke's plan and the 50 year plan. Atleast the titan powers would have been wiped out, there wouldn't be this mass omnicide and he could have lived with Mikasa in a cabin. Why did Levi see his comrades in the steam? And the same thing with Sasha. The worm died offscreen. Weird.

&#x200B;

Carla said that her son was special because he was born into this world. But he was the reason for her death. This hurt to read. Why did Grisha give his titan to Eren anyway? There was no resolution to that scene. Poor Zeke got backstabbed because Eren is just a psychopath. Reiner's mom and Annie's dad got more screentime than Historia. They abused their children and sent them to be used as weapons by Marley. But they get to live happily ever after. While poor Carla died despite loving her son unconditionally. Zeke loved Eren like his little brother but he died in an anticlimatic manner. Carla should have had a son like Zeke. Both would have been better off.

&#x200B;

Why did Gabi have so much aimbot anyway? She claimed that she didn't know how to ride horses, and yet she was seen riding one. She never missed a shot. She can shoot targets while sitting on a flying titan. She suffered no injuries after firing an anti tank rifle. Why? Levi lives with Gabi and Falco. Onyankoupon lived. But Levi didn't even get to open his teashop. Hange died for no reason.

&#x200B;

Reiner is still creeping over Historia. Its weird. Jean is a creep who wants to impress schoolgirls? The curse of Ymir is broken so easily? Why did the plot of a newborn baby inheriting a dead titan not get used? What was point of Historia's child being born during that fight? The final panel was Grisha and Eren. If the attack titan can see the future, then why did Grisha tell Eren that he was free? How could a child who is going to have such a fucked up life be free? Poor Carla deserved so much better. By the way that Eren's birth panel looks just weird. It looks like he pasted Carla's face on Dina's body from the Zeke birth panel. And then pasted Grisha and baby Eren on top of it.

&#x200B;

He actually showed king Fritz surrounded by women in the panel where Eren said that she loved him. Its so messed up. Ymir was suffering from stockholm syndrome. She loved a man who burned her village, took her as a slave, hunted her down for freeing pigs, cut her tongue out, gouged her eye out, there was an arrow sticking out of her foot,  used her powers to destroy so many people, forced her to bear his children, she looked like she was barely out of her teens and he looked like 50. Its so disgusting. Does the writer like ugly bastard hentai? 

&#x200B;

Mikasa deserved so much better. She didn't publically associate with the alliance and their talk no jutsu. She deserved to live a happy and normal life, not mourn Eren forever. What was the point of her being a secret princess? She would keep mourning over Eren and grow old alone? I wish that the traffickers never arrived at her house and she had never met Eren and his father in her life. She deserved a peaceful life with her family not be traumatized forever. The rumbling happened because she picked the wrong option. She had to kill the guy who she liked. Wouldn't she be the most mentally scarred out of everyone?

&#x200B;

How come the world is recovering at all? Eren didn't even have a solid reason to do the rumbling. He didn't want to gamble the future of Paradis but now we have this. If he has wiped out 80% of the human population, then how much ground did his titans cover. Wouldn't it have wiped out most of the world's forests and even the ocean life. Titans are supposed to have a high body temperature and swam to the mainlands. Why isn't the whole world dead, including Paradis. The environment should be completely messed up by this. What happened to the colossals and the titans that were left in Shiganshina. Did they turn back into humans? Are the military police officials who drank the wine human again? Connie said that his mother must have reverted too, so Pixis and Nile also died for no reason. If the colossals reverted to humans again, wouldn't they be confused af. They essentially time travelled to the future by a century.

By the way, the warhammer cord was never used again. The forest of giant trees was never explained. The reason for the existence of abnormal titans was not explained either."

H-K_47,None,[removed]
H-K_47,None,And I won't change my mind that I can only see Yumikuri as a good-written relationship and develop love. Historia know that freckle Ymir didn't want her to give up on her life and just follow her. Glad Historia got family and pretty good ending.
H-K_47,foolish_pleasures,I don’t get it how/why did eren kill his mom

H-K_47,FeministFireant,"I hope we get to see a bit more in the anime in terms of Ymir and Hallucigenia disappearing and maybe some flashes of Eren talking to/saying goodbye to the rest of the Alliance in Paths before wiping their memories. Overall, I think it was a pretty good ending; if anything, dividing the end of the battle and paths stuff into one episode and closing with the aftermath on another as a proper epilogue might have made it even better. 

I think to some level ANR theory is fulfilled with Eren dying and being buried under the tree and the rest of the Alliance coming back to Paradis feeling like they betrayed Eldians and are not welcome, while being haunted by the spoils of war? Maybe that's just me tho lol"

H-K_47,AssPork,Did Mikasa just leave with Eren's head to hide from the Marleyans and Eldians outside the alliance (who'd probably want to desecrate his head or something) or did she seriously think she could return to Paradise from her current location when they just crossed the ocean by plane?
H-K_47,None,[removed]
H-K_47,Aerohand,"It's a regular ending, not good nor bad. But the whole chapter reeks of r/im14andthisisdeep .

In all honesty, it feels to me that Isayama had two possible endings in mind. Idk if you guys remember the last panel Isayama drew two years ago, showing a father and a kid, with the  ""You're finally free"". I believe he wanted (at first) to end it with a big time loop of Eren somehow dying and reborn again in a timeline without titans or something like that but he ended up abandoning the idea and here's his choice.

I do hate that he gave Historia a good character development arc and then after the time skip only used her a cheap plot device... Like what in the actual fuck? 
And after the 3 years time skip, she's now leading An army with advance tech. STFU.

What about Worm-kun? If there are more like him in the world then the titan powers are still out there, so the whole Lelouch thing was for nothing. The country is still going to war, his friends might still fight/die in horrible ways and it's even worst now that they don't have the titan powers.

Giving Eren the ability to command titans through space-time gives the series a major plot-hole. By stating that he sent titanized Dina to his house because Bert had to live, he admits to having the ability to change the past/future and things could've ended differently.

Well, at least it's over. Good stuff to pass the time."

It's just Isayama telling the audience: ""Please be sad, this is not a happy end"" Such an unnatural dialogue and not sure that Isayama really wrote this himself."
H-K_47,min-m1n,Why is no one talking about the fact that what Eren did was basically what Fritz did?
H-K_47,ultimateweebalt123,"Wait, the Founder can influence events from the past? Couldn't Eren just completely change the timeline for the best result if that were the case? Because he already saw the future where it happened? Why should Eren, who's all about freedom, care about that? Like, for example, he said his mom had to die in Bert's place, couldn't he just have Dina kill neither of them if the Founder really transcends time like that? If the Founder is that powerful, there's so much other stuff he could've done for a better outcome. 

Also, minor nitpick: When they're talking about Ymir and the king, they say the name ""Karl Fritz"". Karl is the name of the 145th or whatever king, not the one who married Ymir, right? So either 1)it was a translation mistake 2)Yams seriously forgot who was who and mixed them up or 3)Yams made the very confusing decision to name them both Karl.

Edit: A lot of people are telling me that A)Carla had to die to motivate Eren and/or B)The timeline is pre-determined and Eren couldn't do anything about it. For A)if Eren was able to talk to Grisha, Armin and Mikasa, then he should be able to motivate himself like that. For B)I just really don't like that idea. It's a bootstrap paradox. If they this timeline only happened because of Eren messing up the timeline, then how did this timeline happen in the first place, before Eren messed up the timeline? It doesn't make any sense to me.

Edit 2: Also, I forgot to mention this because it got overshadowed by all the time travel BS, but are Armin and the Alliance really ok with Eren after he killed 80% of the world? Pretty much nothing changed, aside from the fact that now they know he was going to leave some survivors, but the 20% surviving doesn't suddenly forgive the 80%. How are they ok with so many people being killed?"

But at the end of the story he just took this supernatural element and threw it out of the window without any reasonable explanation. The Worm dissapeared offscreen, eldian race was erased, the power to create energy and matter out of nothing is gone just like that.

I don't think that fit the tragic theme of the entire story."
H-K_47,PalangYangTwins,"Did everyone forget that Eren had the Founding Titan? Just as every holder of the Founding before him, Eren was entirely beholden to the inevitability of the future. I think the conversation at the start of 139 between Armin and Eren is really Armin's conversation with the host of the Founding. The Founding has always been tied to ""life"" i.e. the weird centipede thing. And as Zeke says in 137 or 138, life's purpose is just to multiply. Its purpose is also its curse. Once the centipede was separated from Eren, only then could Eren be killed. And only Ymir, the original Founding, could break the Titan's curse when she saw that death doesn't mean the end of love (she is in the frame when Mikasa beheads then kisses Eren at the end of 138). Inextricably tied to life is death. I think by getting Dina to eat Eren's mother, start the rumbling, etc. the host of the Founding (depicted as Eren) was really just trying to break the curse of infinite life. Linked to the curse of life are love, pain, war, etc. We see at the end that the Jager faction still exists and stuff. But only with death of the old (death of titans, of Eren, of 80% of the world, of Ymir's curse) could new life be born (Historia's child, Armin's goals of peace, a new world order). In conclusion, I think the characters, and Eren in particular, are not being ""controlled"" necessarily, but they are the vessels of the story of life, love, death, and rebirth. 

This whole story was AMAZING. Looking back, these themes were explored beautifully throughout the whole show. And everything starting with the Marley arc and onwards (season 4 of the anime) just tied everything together perfectly."

Eren literally controlled everyone like a puppet even himself. People literally want endings that wouldn't make sense. Sure Eren killed his mom isn't what's appealing but when you think about it. Why didn't dina just straight up eat Carla instead she killed her first which makes sense when eren was the one who controlled her. If Carla didn't die that day none of attack of titan would've ever happened. Marley would still treat eldia like shit.

H-K_47,galxybrain,"Sorry if this gets long I just read the chapter and getting thoughts out. 

Well, it's not the worst ending ever, it could be a lot worse, but to be honest - I think it was more rushed than anything. Which is what we were all kind of bracing ourselves for anyway. I could be content with how Isayama would decide to end the story in terms off events (power of titans disappearing, eren dying, peace being made) but just not at this speed and messiness. I don't think I need to repeat the plot-holes others are stating like what the point or significance of Historia's baby was, Hallu-chan disappearing, the colossal titans disappearing, no conclusion to Ymir, some characters not even making appearances, and everything moving very fast. 

I saw someone else say this, but I also think that it could have been better by fixing the tone of these scenes too. For so many horrendous things happening - such as, you know, genocide....as well as Paradis becoming a scary Yeagerist state, having all those lighthearted jokes scattered inbetween felt very strange and hard to get in the mood for. I don't know how to describe this, but reading this chapter, even with all it's illustrations and panelling...still somehow felt like I was merely reading a summary of what happened in this chapter that was just plainly written out by someone else. Although I have hope that this can be fixed in the anime, maybe. 

They ended up pulling a Lelouch...but it kind of went back on everything that had tried to previously been explained about how Eren had no choice but to do what he did. I had come to believe that he had convincing personal motivations to go ahead wih the rumbling, not that he was doing it to become the big common enemy. Throughout this arc, I was always happy for the Lelouch type ending to be a possibility, but as evidence for it continued to be slim all the way through, I didn't think it could be done well anymore and I had given up on it. So once again, I think it was a matter of pacing and execution. Instead of demonstrating this to the readers, this point is basically blantally stated by the characters so that the readers can say ""oh ok so that's why he did that."". And that's another thing I felt quite a bit, there was just a lot of exposition. Three pages of narration to explain some big points. And speaking of narration, I was disappointed to a lesser extent that there was no sort of conclusion for that either, it could have sounded more grand and theatrical beginning from ""That day, humanity received a grim reminder."" and concluding here.

As for eremika and how it was a big part of this chapter - Eren's ""Mikasa finding another man?"" and ""I want her to think about me for at least 10 more years.""........yeah. I feel like this isn't even about hating the ship, it was just objectively very strange, as Eren has never shown any reciprocation of Mikasa's romantic feelings for him. EVER. I mean it, if Isayama had just made Eren show some reciprocation in some moments somewhere else during the series, it would feel a lot more natural - but it was just out of the blue. And of course, the ending scene didn't just feel underwhelming because it centred on eremika again, but it was such a disappointing ending for Mikasa's character arc. I was happy for her to finally be free of him, and I would really really wanted to have seen a moved on Mikasa with everyone else. It would have been nicer to see her lay the scarf at his grave rather than continue to be wrapped in it. 

Also I Just want to mention possibly the thing I hated most in this chapter -- that Ymir apparently loved Karl Fritz. Of course, we can understand that as some horrible stockholm syndrome, but the word ""love"" just creeped me out especially when parralelling that love with Mikasa's for Eren, and THEN seeing her not over him in the last scene. Attack on Titan has always had a strong theme of love, and how it is important, like Kruger's words to Grisha - but it's *because* that genuine love is important here that reducing Ymir's relationship as a slave to her master, Karl Fritz, as being ""love"" too was uncomfortbale.  

Okay now I can go to positives. I do appreciate some things - I appreciate that Armin was the main hero in the end, I am happy for that. And I'm happy that things didn't go to perfect peace even three years later, it's more realistic. Levi doing the salute one more time was nice too. Funny that Reiner never died, happy that Jean and Connie and all others who transformed last chapter are okay. 

Overall, although I have so many criticisms, strangely, I'm actually not *mad* at all. And though I say ""disappointed"" I don't really feel it deeply. (This is a strange feeling... I don't feel scared at all. I can see everything clearly. I feel like, no matter how this all plays out, I can accept whatever happens. That's right, nobody's in the wrong. There was nothing we could do.) But yeah. I accept it. Despite all the criticisms I actually easily accept it. 

Finally, thank you Isayama for this incredible series that I have been following for 8 years. This last chapter won't make me forget all the incredible emotions and journey this series has taken me through. I'll never forget all the clever secrets and shocking reveals. I'll never forget the moments I loved the best, from when Bertholdt and Reiner revealed, Ymir's reveal, Erwin's death charge, discovering what was in the basement, being mindblown learning about Marley, learning about Ymir Fritz, and so much more. Watching the story get prgressively more and more intense and lead to the end. I won't forget those feelings. Thank you :)"
H-K_47,Bodinm,"I got started with Attack on Titan on a random summer day while I was still in highschool, season 1 was just starting. I immediately got hooked by the setting, animation and soundtrack. Since then I finished highschool, started and graduated from the university and got a job in my profession. I remember listening to OSTs before exams imagining Erwin shouting SUSUME to me, that sort of thing seriously helps with motivation. Attack on Titan represents a whole era of my life.

I seriously got into manga around the end of RtS arc and basement reveal. Around the same time I first made a reddit account and joined the community to read the discussions and reactions as I was the only manga reader in my circle of friends. Since then the circle of manga readers only grew, coincidentally a lot of them started reading the manga right when chapter 119 dropped so you can imagine how torturous and how funny their first monthly wait was.

I have never experienced a work of fiction before in such way. All the theories, discussions, memes, leaks and craziness elevated my experience to such a level that these moments made my life truly wonderful these past years.

I don't care that people wanted a more tragic ending, all I wanted was a confirmation that Eren did all this because he loved them and I am incredibly glad that I got that. The stuff that was left out of the chapter, specifically regarding Historia and why she agreed to the plan can be figured out from all the things we have seen and if you have questions you can check out [this theory of mine that pretty much came true](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/mjf0yb/the_final_ending_theory_eren_goals_paradis_fate/), even though not all points were explicitly mentioned.

I want to thank Isayama for crafting this masterful story, truly a game between him and the readers with all the hints, foreshadowings, twists and turns. And thank you to all of you who played that game and made this such an unforgettable experience for me.

After 11 years and 7 months NOW WE ARE FREE."
H-K_47,DasUngeheuer,"Just one last thing: If you have to make mental gymnastics to make a plot point sound good enough for you, that's not good writing. Treat yourself, love yourself. Accept better. Just because an author spent 11 years writing something doesn't mean they're exempt from criticism. Good night everyone. It has been really fun."
H-K_47,SpodermanJuan,"The saddest part of this ending is that it would have been 100% better if the entire Armin & Eren conversation was cut. Then we’d be left with an ending where somehow the alliance beat a god and made it so the islands future was left up in the air on whether it’d turn out fine. So basically the typical shonen ending a decent portion were expecting. Instead we basically got confirmation that Eren was pulling a Code geass by making himself the villain so his friends would be heroes and that he doesn’t actually want to do the rumbling so he only killed 80% of the population to buy time for Paradis. So basically a total 180 of literally everything he said in 130-131 along with his speech in 123. So if his goal was to just basically leave Paradis’ future up to a gamble was it really necessary to kill all those people? The outcome wouldn’t have been different had he just done what Armin suggested and destroyed the worlds military. 

Let alone getting into the entire point of even telling Historia what was apparently a made up plan about doing a full rumbling and still not really understanding why she even bothered bringing up a child with Eren, it was a plot thread that was utterly pointless and went nowhere, making it unnecessary. If we weren’t going to ever get more clarification into their conversation then frankly let’s be honest, nothing would have changed had their conversation just ended with Eren saying she’s the worst girl. 

Ending was a flop, wasn’t necessarily bad but added stuff that only served to provide inconsistencies with Eren specifically. Turned a irredeemable but very understandable character with relatable and somewhat “noble” reasons for doing something fucked up (Guaranteeing a future for his home so as not to push the sins of adults unto Paradis’ future children at the cost of the rest of the world), into a character apparently killing billions only to lead to quite literally the status quo. Oh yeah and titans are gone now so it definitely changes things lol. Your telling me he couldn’t have just basically eliminated the worlds military powers then offed himself instead of killing billions of people and it wouldn’t have basically achieved the same result?"

H-K_47,None,[deleted]
H-K_47,Proto-Omega,"In the end, what was the point?   

This is the kind of the question for a lot of actions. The end goal was for his friends to live long and happy lives, but said goal could have been achieved without this somewhat convoluted mess.   

The ending felt very clearly rushed, and tried to neatly tidy up everything, but it ends up leaving a lot more questions up in the air that seriously need an explanation.   

Eren’s character is divisive. Now ignoring the people who treated him like a god, as if they were actual Yaegerists, I understand the disappointment. I get what it was going for, and honestly, I respect the decision to make Eren very much human in the end. Flawed, selfish desires, crumbling under the knowledge of timelines, etc. In the end, he was just some teenager that didn’t want to die, who had too much knowledge and power he didn’t really know what to do with. I can respect that.   
However, I don’t like it. Basically, Eren is still the same boy from back in the day, and he never matured at all. All his resolve and dedication to his plan was one big facade he was putting on, because he didn’t know what the hell he was even doing. This feels like major backtracking on the character, unless they mean to say all the scenes with Eren resolving himself to initiate the rumbling was meant to fool the reader? There was no point to Eren being able to see the timeline and influence it if he doesn’t really change anything. Why give him that ability if it goes nowhere really. You didn’t need time stuff to create a motivation for Eren.
Speaking of that, Eren’s mother, in the grand scheme of things, didn’t have to die and was a pointless death. So Eren killed his mother for no reason. He was always planning to join the Survey Corps, and the anger he felt at titans was nullified once he gained his father’s memories, so what was the point of Carla’s death? Why ensure it happens? The explanation of “Eren didn’t know what the hell he was doing?”, brushes things to the side and is really stupid.   

Armin thanking Eren for killing 80% of the world population feels like a ‘sweep it under the rug’ deal just to wrap things up tidily. Everyone of Eren’s friends knew the entire motivation behind the rumbling. The reason was never a secret. They still opposed the idea of it though. Why suddenly thank him for that atrocity, when you were never for it in the first place? What changed, that you suddenly feel like you should be thankful to him, and treat him like a hero? You always knew he was doing it for you. 
And Historia’s letter basically saying “Eren was right. He should have rumbled fully” doesn’t help matters. That brings me onto the partial rumbling too. Eren’s whole thing before was that he wanted to guarantee that his friends had a future, and didn’t want to gamble their lives, or was that another facade he was putting up? I get the idea of people having to shape their future for themselves, but it was never about the chance for peace, it was about the assurance of peace. Well, that’s what we were lead to believe anyway, but apparently the rumbling had no defining motivation behind it? Just vagueness.  

The relationship aspect always gets dicey in any fandom, but ignoring everything else for now, what doesn’t sit right with me, at all, is Ymir’s love for King Fritz. *Why*? Like, even Stockholm Syndrome becomes hard to believe when it was just that atrocious. Had her parents killed, treated her like a slave (which entails all sorts of physical and emotional torture), bred her, had her children eat her...    
Why would you ever love someone like that? Why cry when Eren stated you were free? Does that mean she just wanted to love the King as a free person and not a slave? It’s all a big “why?” to that. Is it that she never knew what true love was? So Eren didn’t save her, but Mikasa did? But if they’re paralleling that relationship, Mikasa kissing Eren after decapitating him goes back on that.   
And bloody hell, with Eren and Mikasa. Eren never wanting her to move on ever, while works for a teenager who doesn’t want to die, still feels terribly shitty. Mourn him forever, and basically never be happy. The only reason the rumbling happened was because she told him that she sees him as family then. Had she said otherwise, the vision that Mikasa saw (which could possibly be Eren’s vision now) would have probably come about.     
Historia and the baby was just a stall tactic and nothing more. Historia actually decided to be with her childhood bully, and nothing really came from her being pregnant. It was just to stall. So her relevance was basically non-existent really. Why show us her giving birth occasionally? What was the point, when she, nor her baby, wasn’t important at all?    
The focus on romantic love and relationships in the end felt very out of nowhere for the very end of this series, and although I don’t care for shipping and the lot, Eren and Historia had the most healthy relationship that could have gone romantic if it was written that way. But all the relationships just felt messy really.   


Look, honestly, there are chains of questions that keep on linking to one another because of how rushed this ending feels. I get the idea, and understand where it was trying to go, but it honestly doesn’t work to me.  
Eren had more power and knowledge that he knew what to do with and is secretly falling apart is an interesting take. But it throws away all the scenes that Eren resolves himself to make these hard decisions, that he’s accepting his death and needs to do something to ensure the rest of his friends live happily; it throws that all away, and as such, basically all his character development. He never matured and never really grew up. Yes, not all characters need to have character development in your story, but 1) character development actively assists your character and shows clear signs of growth, 2) not giving character development to your main character can really hurt a series (depending on what that type of series is anyway), and 3) actually giving your character development, but then throwing it all away just for some twist is a tactic that doesn’t work too often, and is just generally bad form if not written well.     

To the author of this manga, well done for your brilliant work, but absolutely stay away from time travel of any sorts. Honestly, a lot of authors need to stay away from time travel. If you’re not prepared to plan out everything and answer every question when it comes to time travel, you shouldn’t include it in your story. If romantic character relationships isn’t your forte, don’t make it a major plot point that moves or revolves around the plot, especially when there are no clear signs from both parties (but that’s just a personal thing for me. One-sided love can be a decent character motivation, but obviously, things just need to be written well).  

Honestly, I’d give the ending a 5.5/10.
It’s not god awful, but boy, there’s a lot of things I’m not fond of, and a lot of questions that need answering."
H-K_47,Zatheus,I would like to apologize to all the people I recommended this manga. I'm so sorry.
H-K_47,Keres513,"I've been reading this manga month by month without fail since 2016, this has been a long ride I have been glad to be a part of and the community with all it's theories, fanart and shitposting has been a great part of it too.

There is flaws to this ending, Historia's subplot, Ymir's story being wrapped in 2 panels etc... However I do not think it is a *bad* ending. At first I thought it was stupid that Eren didn't finish the Rumbling but he in fact couldn't as it wasn't his destiny. By killing 80% of the world's population, getting killed by the Alliance and setting up the Jeagerist he gave the time and means to the Eldians who can now seize their own future. Perhaps giving the choice make them more free than if Eren had done it in their place, conflict will still arise but they can now choose how to react to it and the fact that the Warriors are still teaming up with the Paradisians proves to the world that an understanding can be found. I like that everything hasn't been resolved but that Eren set them on the right path.

Eren admitting his attachment to Mikasa was a bit unexpected but along all the imagery of him as a child it really shows how much he is lonely, stuck as a idealist pursuing a children's dream in a world that wouldn't allow him to. His destiny was set before his very birth, Eren Jeager was the man that had the less freedom of all and he gave it away to free a single lost girl that had been waiting for thousands of years as long as setting the world toward the right path.

The Survey Corps reunion was a tear jearker and it'll probably hit way harder in the anime, the detitanization was a bit of a cheap scare although predictable but I'm glad that Jean and Connor gets to live. I also like that Eren spoke with everyone through path, it reminds me of Hoenheim in FMA and show really that he cared.

I'm glad I got the chance to experience this story and everything surrounding it and for now I'll just keep moving forward. [Tatakae !](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/058/214/d07)"
H-K_47,crococatstew,"Alright bois. After reading the typset...

1. The exchange conversation between Armin and Eren were so-so. Both of them able to witness the things that they always wanted to do, to explore everything outside the world though its more like Armin's goal at that
2. So Berthold wasn't supposed to die huh... Alright, Imma head out (Dina probably)
3. Eren basically confirmed he does has feelings for Mikasa? I can't see this clearly since I don't even see any romanticize moments they had other than Mikasa's side LOL
4. Alright, should I talk about Ymir? I'm disgusted but OK. I figured out her witnessing Mikasa cutting off Eren's head shows that is it OK to let go of someone you love? Acceptable.
5. I was kind of lost when Mikasa asked Armin, if his memories returned? Then again I assumed it was probably the power of the Founding Titan.
6. I assumed all of their memories were brought back by Eren? Judging the fact that all of the titans returned back to humans
7. My poor boy Levi, somehow his question to his comrades was a bit sarcastic. That's what they devoted their hearts for? Fighting titans to wipe them all but in a cost of 80% of the population being annihilated?
8. The post-time skip really shows the aftermaths of everything huh. Well, I get it those who affected by the rumbling will definitely have scars from it. No doubt the other side population of the world will assemble and army to launch an attack soon on Paradis
9. Reiner... does Eren let you live just to become a creep again? RIP
10. Also, what Annie said was nothing but FACTS.
11. Mikasa...Oh Mikasa. After following your character development and journey, this tragic ending continued even after you severed Eren's head.
12. How do I feel about the ending? A bit too dramatic I would say? Maybe I'm used to watching k-dramas and I always suffered from the character's action.
13. Was the ending worth the wait? Well, thank you, Yams. I did not regret picking up this manga again.

See you later, bois o7"
H-K_47,None,"I already mentioned my issues with this ending on the leak thread. 

A lot of contrived character motivations, everything Eren did was for naught and only delayed the extermination of Paradis by a few years, and Ymir/Worm-kun were literal plot devices that disappeared because Isayama didn't care. 

One sentence will be burned in my mind 

When Armin asks why Mikasa had to be the one that set Ymir free... and Eren says ""LOL THAT ONLY YMIR KNOWS"". WHAT. HOW. WHY."
H-K_47,Oposo,"Got fans at least still have G.R.R. Martin and the books

What the fuck do we have?"
Oposo,Valleira,Chapter 123. If you hate the ending to death just consider the final remaining arcs as non cannon and simply fan-fiction from Isayama
H-K_47,None,"in any matter, calling this chapter character assassination for eren is pointless because it was revealed that eren barely knew wtf he was doing because of the attack titans powers"
H-K_47,wearenotlegion,"Forget the ship wars or theories about Eren being the dad.

What the flying fuck was the point of the entire Historia subplot? Why was everything about her pregnancy so cryptic? 

Why was her POV hidden? Why was her reaction to the Rumbling hidden? Why was her conversation with Eren left incomplete? Why was she giving birth months before the military estimated she was due?

In the end, all of that amounted to absolutely nothing. Yams could have literally done anything with her, but instead she was sidelined and turned into a mystery box for absolutely no reason.

I’m almost inclined to believe the resolution to Historia’s storyline got changed last minute, whether through editorial interference or Yams just changing his mind. It’s just such a bafflingly bizarre writing choice for a once-major character."
H-K_47,the-bonesaw,"Overall I didn't have a problem with how it ended. It's about as bittersweet of an ending as I could have expected. My one lingering regret is that the very last couple panels didn't feel complete. It was a very nice serene end, and a callback to chapter one with Mikasa and Eren under the tree, and honestly I didn't even mind ""bird-Eren"" still wrapping the scarf around Mikasa one last time (CRINGE, but tbh it was kind of cute haha), but it lacked a bit of closure for me. Personally, I really wish there was one FINAL panel, showing Eren in paths alone, perhaps as a child, standing under that paths tree that mirrors Mikasa's tree. And then maybe a close-up shot of his face, looking at peace, maybe small smile. IDK LOL I'm not an author, this is just what would have elevated the last chapter a bit for me."

H-K_47,3rianaV,"No you know what it is for me guys?? To the folk saying that they can't understand why there's so many people shitting on the ending and that they're happy the characters they love got a happy ending and stuff... like, was it nice to see Jean and Connie again? Fuck yeah. Was it nice to see that our favs weren't suffering in the end? Yeah, sure. But like, at what price? At what price to the integrity of the story? IMO, it feels like a copout. Like a cheap way to create a happy ending for a story that didn't really have a setup for a happy ending by any means. At best, I think a lot of us expected there to be some compromises, both devastating and happy moments in the end. But what we got was Eren's character being trashed in a single panel and something of a fake happy ending; the group is prospective toward world peace so they're gonna try to go talk it out on Paradis, but then the text even says that Eren was probably right and people aren't gonna stop fighting until one party destroys the other. I think this theme even ties back to what Erwin said to Pyxis at some point earlier in the story; it's clearly a theme that's emphasized throughout aot overall. So... what was the point in killing Eren's character off like that and painting his friends as ""heroes of humanity"" when the situation didn't even change very much?? That in itself seemed like an oxymoron to me; Eren himself literally knew the fighting wouldn't stop, but he was just following the path laid out for him based on Ymir's decision concerning Mikasa?? I'm just...disappointed. Like I get the idea for peace ending or whatever for the story...but the execution was way off imo.

Thank you to Isayama for 11 years of hardwork."
H-K_47,Kayounenka,"As I think about it over and over again, this is SNK, this is what made this book different with other literatures. All the characters in SNK are very human, they are flawed, they're not the hero you see on literatures, thus they're still selfish, egoistic, flawed, and this is how I came to understand Eren's character, Armin's indecisiveness, Mikasa's over-attachment. This is always the whole message in SNK just like how Erwin had a selfish childhood dream that he unable to let go not until Levi helped him. As I reflect on how I handle my own family, how flawed they are that a simple issue can't be solved for tenth of years, cos, yea, that's human.

Eren is very tragic character, the whole story is about freedom but he himself can't runaway from his destiny... and since he's just human, he still have his own selfish desire to be with Mikasa and live a happy life, for this debate I don't want to describe further since every people have different perspective. 

There's of course some parts that I think written better on the previous arc. With SNK I think you have to put aside logical+technical stuffs for a while and put more emphasize on the message.

still Historia's character didn't fold well..."

H-K_47,Hoeybo98,"Not the ending that I expected, or really wanted, and the leaks definitely made it seem like it was gonna be a pile of shit. But I dont know, the idea of Eren purposely making himself the villain of the world for attempt at making the world no longer hate Eldians is cool. But the way in which he revealed it was just an act, especially the being cruel to Armin and Mikasa thing, and that he wanted Mikasa at his side always didnt seem to fit him at all.

I believe Isayama struggled with getting a proper conclusion for Eren so that's why. In my opinion its not the worst, but its not the best, not even close really. Overall though, it felt like a satisfying enough ending, but there's still a lot of disappointment."

The biggest complaint for me for 139 was that we had very little Eren/Reiner content. The moral conflict between Eren and Reiner, a soft of rivalry even, had the potential to be the best dynamic in the manga if we had a proper ending to it. The theory that Reiner understood Eren more than Mikasa and Armin is very interesting. I wish we had more of Reiner's insight on Eren's sacrifice instead of ""Eren, you're the man..."" and the story continuing. Did Isayama forget that Reiner and Eren had similar pasts? We didn't really see what Levi had to think about Zeke now being gone, either.

H-K_47,poohead69,"Overall I think this chapter was a very weak way to end this series, but it certainly had its moments. Eren explaining that his thoughts are incomprehensible now was quite sad, the ability to transcend time really broke his mind and it makes sense that it would. Mikasa cradling his severed head and the way Armin reacted to it was tragic as fuck too. I'm not going to bother typing out all the shit that annoyed me though because you've read it all here before. I just wanted closure and what we got felt like it was almost setting up a sequel which we're obviously not getting. This chapter felt rushed I guess, which is ironic considering the final arc dragged on like nobody's business.

Interesting how Eren's motivation was literally what this sub had been predicting since the ""Mikasa, I've always hated you"" scene and now they don't like it anymore. People think Ymir being in love with king Fritz is disturbing? Yeah it is. Her character is deeply disturbed, and it's clear she see's herself in Mikasa, and see's the king in Eren. It's probably why she listened to Eren instead of Zeke in the paths dimension. It's why Mikasa killing Eren ends the era of the titans. I'm a little drunk and can't properly type all my thoughts but this was a good ending to an incredible story. I'll always hold it dear to my heart.

Like ""haha well Eren screwed us all over, killed millions but it's all cool"". I guess it's because how carefree they were acting just caught me offguard.  


I really liked Levi's panels the farewell from the scouts was touching and damn he actually cried. Falco and Gabi are adorable and I'm glad they get to be together in the end. Was nice seeing Onyankopon, Levi, Falco and Gabi in London, seemingly free and not having to deal with Marley+Paradise anymore.  


Ymir being inlove with King Fritz, even after everything is such a wtf moment. Eren turning into an omega incel and the thing with how he klilled his mom is also another wtf moment.

That shit makes no sense? Clearly Mikasa loved him all this time, so he decides to do the rumbling, fail utterly and leave Paradise defenseless because no more titans and everyone still hates them even after he dies. GOOD JOB!!!   


Oh now Historia(or should we just call her Christa again?) is a yeagerist, and leading Paradise which seems to be entirely yeagerists now, seems pretty off. Floch should have stayed alive if that was the route Isayama was going for tbh.   
I really feel bad for Mikasa, poor girl just isn't allowed to be happy.

Guess the true message is the cycle of hatred will never be broken and no good resolutions for you!"

Also, bird!Ellen was our own fault, we manifested that shit into existence. lmao.

Thanks for the laughs everyone. See you later, titanfolk."
H-K_47,None,[removed]
H-K_47,wtrmlnjuc,"Not gonna lie, something feels off about the ending. Besides the obvious plot stuff it feels... rushed and not well planned out for a series that's been so well planned out.

edit: It feels like fanservice."
H-K_47,teypjm,"I get the supposedly Ymir/Mikasa parallel but what I can’t quite comprehend is that Eren had feelings for Mikasa, and he doesn’t want her to move on. It seemed out of nowhere."
H-K_47,None,"If I were to zero in on my two biggest takeaways, they are 

1. Eren killing his own mother was gratuitous and unnecessary, and 

2. this chapter was disorienting in a negative way within the framework of the entire series, and that's not typically something you want from a conclusion."
H-K_47,GuzmaniF,"After letting it sink in for a while....I don't hate it?

It's rushed as hell, leaves several questions unanswered, and incelren feels really out of nowhere. It's certainly disappointing, and just not good overall.

That said, I don't hate it. Eren ultimately being a slave to fate but finding freedom by leaving his friends with the freedom to build their own future is an idea I really like. The farmer being the actual father doesn't really bother me as the series doesn't actually make a big deal out of the baby in the first place, though Eren steering Smiley towards his mom feels like an unnessesary addition. I do still quite like several parts of this chapter conceptually, the issue is just with the execution. It's handled poorly, but not enough so to retroactively ruin the rest of the series.

Those are my brief thoughts on it now at least. My opinion will probably change when I eventually go back and give the series a re-read. Maybe I'll like it more, maybe I'll hate it. I'll leave that to the me an unknown number of years from now to decide. Either way it's interesting to finally see this wild ride come to an end. I enjoyed shitposting with you lads."
H-K_47,between_30_and_20,I legit thought that bird gonna take the scarf away from Mikasa
H-K_47,TacoConPalta,"I felt it was an OK ending, nothing out of the extraordinary but it manages to preserve the essence and history of SNK. In that sense, it succeeded.

Overall, it didn’t blow me away and didn’t disappoint me either. Out of all the theorized endings, this was the most “neutral” one of the lot"
H-K_47,Saucefest6102,"No matter what you think of the chapter (I personally am still trying to fully gather my thoughts but I may end up neutral) I just wanna say that browsing this sub for like 4 years now was really fun, even though I may heavily disagree with the positions of more than a few people here. The reactions to so many of these chapters, from 100 to 121 to 131 to now were truly unique, and I am glad to have been part of this madness. I’m still gonna check this sub every once in a while, but given that this sub was made to be a manga spoilers and “free” counterpart to r/ShingekiNoKyojin, I feel like the journey of r/titanfolk has finished.

See you later, Attack on Titan. And see you later, r/titanfolk.

We are all finally free."
H-K_47,Soul699,"Ok, I've read it finally and I can also positiveely say that IT WASN'T THAT BAD. I'm not gonna say it's great, and there are issues, but it's not as tragic as many thought. THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG ONE. Now let's start by talking about the good parts: Levi and the others seeing their old companions and Gabi hugging Falco was tear jerking. Another thing I point out is I actually don't dislike that Eren do love Mikasa (and EH guys, I may not be on your side, but don't worry. Eren IS still the father. all the hints point at that and it's fine. People CAN love 2 others at the same time. Historia was just the one who scored in the end.) and while his confession may sound cringe, hey, it IS his first confession. I bet none of you went chad-like the first time and awkwardly. Another thing I liked was Eren confirming how many he killed do ends many debate and is a big number of people dead (think it was between 1 and 2 billion in early 20th century, right? So around 200-400 millions people around the globe remained). One last thing I liked was that the world didn't immediatly go to peace, nor Paradis is all let's be friends. They try also for a peaceful approach, but also prepare their armies. And an uncertain future, carried by hope, could potentially be acceptable. Now the bad: first off, it really feel like there were like 20ish pages cut, mainly regarding Ymir stuff and Hallu-chan being killed, make things just confusing. The idea of Eren being a Lelouch COULD work, but there isn't enough build up behind to be fully valid, considering how hellbent he seemed before. Maybe with some adjustment to some of his dialogues it could have better set up. Next, the idea of Eren do essentially sending her mother to die doesn't honestly work. Just doesn't. And while I see why some people would be disappointed with the idea of everyone returning human, I can also accept it as showing the true end of the titan age. In the end, it does seems the desire to end on 139 came biting Yams in the ass. The final battle was honestly lame and the aftermath is meh. It's not TOO bad, but in my opinion it's not great either. I'll give this chapter a 6, MAYBE 7 at best out of 10. However, I'll still say it: THANK YOU ISAYAMA FOR CREATING THIS STORY. I really enjoyed these 6 years with AoT."

No matter what people may say, I still think Attack on Titan is an amazing manga. This story will still go down as one of the better ones in manga history, and I can't wait to see it animated.

Prior to the final battle, Eren was having therapy sessions with all his friends in paths. He lived the cabin life with Mikasa (for 4 years) and he walked and talked with Armin at the beach and in their hometown. He gave everyone a send off and wiped their minds right after so he could keep moving toward. All the paths memories/conversations returned to everyone when Eren died. I only wish we could have seen his interactions with the rest of the crew. 

#Thankyouisayama"
H-K_47,EpicOpticSef,"After reading the chapter again I think that the ENDING was not bad. Yes, the Ymir part and allot of things would be better if it was explained. But this doesn't mean for me that AoT is trash like allot of you guys think now. I think that Isayama just wanted to finish the story on chapter 139 and because of that he rushed some things.. And I hope for a epilogue soon."
H-K_47,SUPREM30,"Anyone else feel like this end will get much better reception from the anime community? The final arc has a lot of action, anime onlies like Mikasa and EM as a whole, and Mappa has proven they can deliver some top tier animation with JJK and GoH. Although they should tweak some scenes/plot points in the final chapter for sure, I can realistically see them making the anime adaptation a lot more enjoyable."

H-K_47,saephan93,Sure it was a little bit rushed but I didn't hate it? Overall i can say that im satisfied with this ending.
H-K_47,Spoopgod,"So, I re-read chapter 139 again with the official translations.

I still think it’s a *bad* chapter, and a bad ending for the series. It does however focus on the main characters motivations, and how everything got out of control for him. There are still a few things this manga does terribly, like female characters. If anything, the last chapter completely messed up Founder Ymir for me, and the outcome of the rumbling is truly a “dark timeline”.... but If there’s one thing Eren knew was that (like Dr strange in Avengers), he saw all the possibilities, possibly at once, and the one where his friends directly (not humanity, but his close friends) benefited from was this one. I’m not even saying they benefitted the most here, but it was the only way to simultaneously stop the titan curse... because of what Ymir wanted/cared about. 

As a main character? Eren is a dumb, selfish, and close minded piece of trash. But maybe he’s a little more relatable now? Also he got his mom killed by saving Bertolt, to ensure Armin would have the power to help beat him later. It was a sacrifice that shows how little control he really had over the effects of his actions. 

Too many loose ends really mess up this ending in my opinion. But I’m hoping MAPPA ties them in December at the very least."
H-K_47,tenkensmile,"Eren killed his mother to build up his resolve to take revenge on those who killed his mother 🤣. I'm not even sad or mad, I'm 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 at this sitcom.

""Founder Ymir LOVED King Fritz"" <<<  Nah, that is Stockholm Syndrome and abusive conditioning. I'm sick of manga pushing abuse as ""love"".

H-K_47,None,"That was far far away from the best ending I could've imagined but it was far from a Game of Thrones S8 tier ending. 

The whole Ymir thing was...just fucked up in a bad way. The panel with Eren being a complete simp could've been done away with and I don't understand what happened to the worm or why exactly Eren choose to send Dina to kill his mom? 

On the other hand- the world state at the end is pretty much what I would've wanted it to be- the fact that the Eldians are no longer able to transform into Titans doesn't mean the cycles of hate is over- far from it but maybe it could lead to the end of the greater conflict. 

Overall- I think this could've used one more chapter to flesh out the questions raised and or give nuance to Eren's relationship to Mikasa.  I have my gripes to what is to me a 4-5/10 ending but I don't think it'll stop me from revisiting the manga or rewatching the anime once it's over."

H-K_47,SiblingBondingLover,"I want rant a little bit here. When I first watched AoT I notice that Isayama doesn't hesitant to kill characters just like GOT.  And when I read an Interview with George R.R martin about character's death he said :

> “We’ve all read this story a million times when a bunch of heroes set out on adventure and it’s the hero and his best friend and his girlfriend and they go through amazing hair-raising adventures and none of them die. The only ones who die are extras,” said Martin. “That’s such a cheat. It doesn’t happen that way. They go into battle and their best friend dies or they get horribly wounded. They lose their leg or death comes at them unexpectedly.” 

And that's what Isayama has been doing since the beginning, but when we enter last arc everyone suddenly has a thick plot armor , in the harbor arc when they fight against the yeagerist(yes Keith and Theo died but they commit suicide). They fought against the literal FOUNDING TITAN and somehow survived all of that, plus the Eldia in paradis somehow forgive the Alliance?"
H-K_47,Mega__lul,"Don’t you guys just love it when your mc does a complete 180 everytime you see him, which is also a very rare sight in the LAST ARC . 

Ramzi really died for this ?! And then he says “they probably didn’t want to die.” Yeah probably . He also has no definitive assurance of Paradis’ future which makes him look even more foolish. A good argument could probably be made that they are still fucked but let’s not.

Seriously if Kishimoto had just given us an eren pov chapter instead of spending pages on useless Farmer subplots and having him contradict himself for every brief moment that he shows up maybe he wouldn’t look like such a wannabe Obito rn ( comparing him to lelouch is an insult)

TL;DR: The doomers wrote better endings."

Historia wasnt turned into a titan, all his friends except sasha rip survived and are going to live full lives and it seems like the war wont continue bc eren killed 80% of the ppl and now the alliance is going to broker a peace deal? There are definitely parts of it i dont like such as ymir having stockholm syndrome, eren killing his mom(altho tbh this was unintentional and i dont think he wanted to do that purposely) and farmer being the father but like damn yall really thought eren was some kinda sociopath who would be able to live w the fact that he murdered the entire population + all the people he loved just for historia?"

H-K_47,None,"So king shitz  last orders for Ymir is to work for him forever creating titans . So Mikasa is the fucking key to all of this

Ymir saw herself in Mikasa because they both were devoted . Ymir sees Mikasa kill Eren and kiss him, then smiles because it shows Ymir that you can love someone but still go off on your own way and disobey them without shedding your love.This means that Ymir can disobey Fritz, and so can stop doing Paths bullshit without compromising her love. So Mikasa's actions were manipulated by Eren so that she'd kill him of her own free will to get Ymir to undo the Titan curse."
H-K_47,KidCaine,"I have one essential gripe with this ending and it has to do with the character assassination of Eren. 

You see, I was totally fine with Eren being the ""villain"" of the story. It provided an interesting final conflict and it was the end conclusion of the story of a tragic character who felt he had to do the ultimate evil in order to guarantee the protection of his people and free himself and his friends. We already sympathized with him because we understood him. He also felt great remorse and understood he shouldn't be saved. I was even fine with Eren losing and dying to his friend's hands as they strove for peace as it was tragic for all and it would be a poetic message, if a bit cliche.

But now Eren was just doing this ""evil"" because....he doesn't even know himself? He then states he was just confused and felt compelled to continue because he had to? He was basically bound by the time mechanics - forced by fate to not alter the past or pre-seen future. This is tragic yes, but not interesting because it boils Eren down to a simple plot device. He never had agency, therefore all his actions just happened becaue it was preordained. 

How uninteresting. We went from a cautionary tale of how tragedy and racial persecution can create a monster to a cautionary tale about how you shouldn't introduce time mechanics in a story because nothing anyone does even matters anymore."

>Eren not defending himself
>Eren not finishing the rumbling - 300 million still alive
>Ymir not deciding which side she's on(Helping Eren one scene,helping alliance another, smiling at Eren death)
>Zeke death underwhelming
>The plot armor
>Nobody running out of gas/blades, but even killing shifters. >Even a crippled Levi (remember how easy levi squad defeated annie?)
>All pure titans surviving (did the colossals also turn human?)

H-K_47,Daed_Wings,"Going to make an analogy here. Say you are in a car race. You are in front of the pack from start to finish because you are good. Then in the final lap, you crashed because you did something unnecessary and went off the road. It costed you the race and the championship. People may remember you for being good throughout the race. But the records will still say that another person won the race and the championship. And to some people, only who won matters. And for the future people, only those who see how the driver raced will be able to tell how the driver performed.

This is my feeling for the ending. Eldia got their army, Eren's friends got to live long. I am not mad if thats how Yams wanted that to end, its just how it was made. From being conflicted and feeling guilty of the weight of the rumbling and paths, Eren decided he will go all in only to fold in the last chapter. Then there is the whole stockholm syndrome that was the issue to solve titans, and the unnecessary inclusion of Eren influencing Dina to eat Carla. The ending is indeed divisive. It was good story, but the ending ruins a lot of things."

H-K_47,Average_Animefan,"I always thought a Lelouch ending would never work for AoT, and as it turns out, I was right.

This was clear to me the moment the rumbling actually started. After all, once you start, you not only draw all the worlds hatred on yourself, but on the entire eldian race, simply because they are inherently (or can be easily portrayed as) capable of doing it as well.

So the only way to break the circle of hatred with the rumbling would be to kill absolutely everyone. Not just 80%, but everyone. Just killing the majority only makes you more hated.

~~The titan powers disappearing doesn't mean anything either, simply because the only ones that can prove it are eldians and honorary eldians (marleyens), and it's in their best interest to hide their powers for now.~~  I forgot the titan serum exists, that seems like some decent prove. Not undisputable, but pretty good. Thanks u/jacob2467 for the reminder!

&#x200B;

Yes, it would require some blatant conspiracy theories and half-truths to rile up the remains of humanity against the eldians, but that's easily done, especially if one of them just caused the apocalypse.

&#x200B;

All in all, I expected the ending to not work (I honetsly couldn't think of a way for it to end in a coherent way anyway) but this, while disappointing is an ending I can accept. I'll probably watch it again in the anime.

P.S.: What happened to worm-kun? Did Eren just Thanos snap it out of existence? Was it unable to survive outside of it's host? I didn't catch that."

So Erens goal from the VERY start was to get to the point where Mikasa could bring herself to kill him, in order to end everything (because of the whole Ymir and Fritz thing)?

A lot of the past-tense, future-tense confusion in the Armin and Eren scene is smoothed out, and Armin's weird ""thanks for the genocide lol"" line makes a lot more sense.

It's crazy how much different [""Thank you.  You became a mass murderer for our sake.""](https://manga4life.com/read-online/Shingeki-No-Kyojin-chapter-139-page-19.html) reads from ""Thank you for turning yourself into a mass murderer for our sake."" along with the new  ""I promise I won't let this *error* go to waste.""  

It's much more reasonable that Armin is acknowledging that what Eren did was wrong, but also that he did for their sake, and thanking him for *his intentions* instead of the near-genocide.  It feels a lot more like ""what's done is done, I promise we'll make the most of it"" this way."
H-K_47,Will_I_am344,"I think it's a good chapter because it's in line with very dark human traits, as have been the silver lining throughout the series.

Eren, who wants to experience freedom was cursed with knowing how to make a ""decent"" ending, and out of fear, choose to act upon it by forsaking his own freedom, with which he could of very well gotten an even better ending. Therefore, acting on fear rather than values, which is extremely common among humans.

Ymir, falling in love with her abuser, having no real sense of what love is and ultimately falls victim to the Stockholm Syndrome due to the masochistic nature of being a slave.

I believe this ending is a great example of how people fall victim to their weakness and how flat things can feel. Eren wasn't a strong calculating mastermind, quite the opposite. Ymir with the power to break free, choose to stay as a slave. Great writing."
H-K_47,MaulVader2,"Having just read the chapter, this doesn't feel like a conclusion at all. Like, I can accept most plot points that happened, even if some are a bit weak, but I have just as many questions as I did before reading what is supposed to be the *final* chapter. What happened to the worm? Did it just die because Eren died? What about Grisha, we never saw why he gave Eren the FT after asking Zeke to stop him. Or Historia, what was the point of her pregnancy after all, was it just to write her out of the story post-timeskip? And did I read the whole chapter or was the final panel missing, because that wasn't there.

I may need to read it a few more times, but I think this is neither a strong nor a weak ending, this isn't an ending at all simply put, at least not one that wraps up every plot point that was still open."
H-K_47,Slayer196,I'm just really grateful for this journey I can't even say anything else I

H-K_47,TheRetroGoat,"I've said it before, but this last talk between Eren and Armin should've been between Eren and Mikasa.

She was the person ""To you, 2,000 years from now,"" she was the focal point of this chapter, half their talk revolved around her, and it would've given some character development to a person that honestly didn't get much. 

But I'm also in the camp of desperately wanting to know what Eren said to everyone else. Especially since it made Jaean, Connie, Reiner, and even fucking Annie cry. He completely skipped Levi though."

H-K_47,TrashFan9000,"The ending just feel so meh for me, everything is predetermined Eren really didn't have a choice and it bothers me that Eren didn't even try to go against fate and just blindly follows it without knowing the whole picture, Eren didn't even know that if his friends will survive during the rumbling and didn't even know the outcome for paradise, in the end the curse is done but its bound to happen anyway and his friends are still not safe because the war could still happen."

Grisha would have some esplainin to do lucy. 

But quite honestly if Dina had eaten Bertolt. She would regain consciousness and she and Grisha could have taken down Reiner. 

Both of them just go and get the founding titan and then it's a question of if Dina eats the founder or if it's Grisha. 

The descendants of Fritz are usually overwhelmed by the founder that they usually don't do anything. So it's possible if Dina did get that power she also could have just decided to say F it and just live and take care of Mikasa. Grisha obviously doesn't get overwhelmed by the founder. But with that combo of Grisha and now Dina. It's possible that Grisha frees Libero"
H-K_47,Kvargen95,"So I have only read the entire manga this year and waited for 137 and 138 to come out, then after I read 138 I was surprised to hear it was the second to last chapter to the entire thing. Now a lot of the backlash seems to be fixated on the last chapter and everything that went wrong there. Personally I was pretty disappointed waiting for the last chapter because I felt that so many characters were ""forgotten"" and that there would be way to many questions to answer in one final chapter.

I dont think a different chapter would have satisfied me, the last arc was just a bunch of action with very limited character development."

The way it is portrayed in images and words does not give it a twisted quality, and we all know the series is able to conjure that kind of imagery if needed. 

Even if that'd be the case, this is a heavy, complicated topic, and using it in such an offhanded way feels like bad storytelling. The pain of a woman is used as a tool to justify the plot. She was hardly a fully realized character. You can say that her love was twisted, but unless you actually explore that properly, you can't make the audience actually feel that or believe in it."

H-K_47,RoomierCanine24,"Ending was on track to being good and I like the theme of it but it was executed horribly. Hopefully mappa spend more time explaining the plot holes, padding out the last chapter and changing up some of the cringy dialogue in the anime. That would make the ending go from a 7 to potentially over 9 imo."
H-K_47,TheSpiritForce,"Alright here's what I wish he did with the ending. Everyone else has a fan canon ending, may as well add mine.

It felt like we lost the buildup involving Ymir's influence on Eren. His plan was too extreme to make sense. Imagine if Ymir, after being awakened by Eren, the one who finally allowed her to break free of the King's rule (In this case our royal blooded Zeke) she amplified Eren's anger and convinced him to kill everyone outiside the island. Otherwise it seems insane that he would use the rumbling to kill all the Eldians outside Paradis. When Eren spoke to everyone in the Paths, he should have told them that those who remain within the interment zones would be spared. The Eldians worldwide would attempt to warn others, and only those who trusted and had little contempt for Eldians would listen. It would serve as a test to see who is worthy of being saved. Most people would refuse. They would attempt to run and be trampled. In his amplified rage, Eren would lose sight of his plan as Ymirs suffering became one with his own. If a collosal titan decides to go berserk on one of the zones, this will give us a new reason for the train escape sequence with the Liberio crew despite Eren's promise to keep Eldians safe within them.

Ymir used Eren as a tool for her revenge. She only lifts the Titan curse when she sees Mikasa kill Eren. Ymir realizes that she became just as cruel as the King that Eren freed her from. This remorse she feels allows her to disconnect from the parasite. As is, the story isn't clear on if Ymir could have always given up the titan powers. However, it makes sense that she didn't. It saved her life, granted her and her children power and freedom they would have never had otherwise. We can go further and assume she could only give it up once Eren ""woke"" her from her trance in the paths and allowed her to have free will again. In the end, realizing her cruelty caused the death of the one who brought her freedom, does she give up her power.

This would retain most of the real ending events, but make for a better conclusion to Eren and Ymir's character's. Also, get rid of the part where the Eldians are warmongering. A better ending for Paradis would be that they were happy to have came out on top in the end, but as they cross the seas to claim the now empty lands and find surviving Eldians, they see the devastation that the last 20% of humanity is living in, and lose their will to fight them. Instead, Historia offers any survivors a chance to live on the Island alongside Eldians if they so chose. It's revealed that Eren chose not to alter her memories after the rumbling like he said he would. Eren wants his friends to be free after all."

H-K_47,isthatmyphonecharger,"I would like to just give the whole thing a generous 8/10 but whenever I think about how much this series has become a part of my life, all I could think about is that it's a 10/10 for me. I can't let how I feel about the ending distort my opinion about the whole series. 139 wasn't even *that bad.* Just lacking. Could have gone with 60-80 pages, just to show us at least the rest of the world's point of view, and the future of those people who didn't die in the rumbling. And THAT BABY. Because I think that shit is important to show the ""born into this world"" theme of the story at least after all those deaths. Isayama could have also just ditched that incel Eren panel and everything would have been, I guess, okay?? But it is what it is. I still fucking love Attack on Titan, and Isayama gave us that. I can't hate him for the ending when it's the same person who gave me the rest of the story. The experience I had reading it is something I won't ever forget, even if I get dementia.

To those who regret reading the whole thing just because the ending was far from the one they expected, I hope you guys find inner peace. Isayama wanted it to end sooner. He could have fleshed out the ending for at least one more chapter. But I think the man's tired of AOT. And I respect his decision. If he really wanted the money he could have continued for 2 more years. Or 30. But he didn't. He's probably burnt out and just wants to spend his time playing games and sleeping instead of stressing and meeting deadlines. He earned this shit. Thank you, Isayama."

I was part of the typeset gang, I didin't get spoiled, I put my favourite songs to listen when reading SnK, and tried to read the last chapter without any expectations. I shit you not I thought I was reading a joke. I absolutely love the manga, it has been with me a good portion of my life, but I can't still grasp how half assed Eren motive's are. I enjoy the ""world survived, no titan powers, Levi survives and lives with no regrets, the characters survived but has to oppose a different world"". But it just feel weird and terrible that the reason they live in that world is because a fucking INCEL couldn't figure out his feelings."

*All the titans from the last chapter just magic themselves back into humans

*Instant Peace ending (Although I am glad that they clarified exactly how many people ate dust. 80% is no joke, gg Mr. Yeager)

*Armin gets to see a volcano

H-K_47,LifeButBetter,"Dude when Mikasa said she wanted to see eren one more time, I started fucking crying bro. I love mikasas character. And knowing the amount of emotional strength it had to take. Even when she said that there has to be another way to talk to eren, not to kill him. And the feeling of helplessness when everyone was talking about how to kill Eren, especially when Jean told her they have to kill him. She just wanted to properly talk to him, not through paths, just normally. When she asked just to talk to eren one more time in the last chapter hit me like a truck man. I really hoped instead of just an Eren and Armin paths talk, we could see erens talk with Mikasa. I like the fact that Mikasa is the special one, and I like what Isayama did with her arc. When she finally gains the courage to kill the one person she loves and would always lay her life down for them."

H-K_47,Ancient-ocean,"My thoughts about Eren

I never liked when people were talking about Eren as a god, ultra-giga chad, outstanding mastermind, ect. For me he always felt just like a person, human with his own average personality, not an emotionless chad divine being. It seems that people don't even remember that he was angry kid, arguing about simple things, crying a lot, thinking about his friends, having a strong desire to exterminate all titans. When he saw future memories, he was like 16, I believe. Imagine getting the information that your are doomed to murder millions of people soon, when you are a teen. Nothing strange that this broken him down. I do not believe that person who lived like this for 4 years do only rational things. In fact, humans do a lot of irrational things and actions every second, I don't think that it's unexpected for Eren to act selfish or irrational sometimes. Overall, of course all of that ending with him was rushed and definitely not done in the best way, but I like Eren been just a mere human, with shitty sides of his personality, selfishness, been that angry crying kid who would fight with bunch of bullies without thinking how he can do it, been a kid who want to kill all titans.

This is my personal opinion and point of view, you are free to disagree and critique me, that is absolutely fine."
H-K_47,STD_ER,"Did everyone ignore the fact that Eren said even if he knew he wasn’t going to die he would still do the rumbling? He’s still the same savage, to protect his loved ones. He has always cared about his closest group of friends. He didn’t take his friends’ freedom of being able to stop him because he cares about them. Also didn’t stop them because he needed to show Ymir what Mikasa would do in order to get rid of the power of titans for Eldians. What exactly changed just because he said he cares for Armin or wants Mikasa to only love him? He tells Mikasa to get over him in her path sequence. He even tells Armin that he told Mikasa to get over him. He’s simply having an honest emotional moment with Armin (his closest friend) because he’s about to die. Although he says he wants Mikasa to only love him, his actions say otherwise. Also Armin was teasing Eren about Mikasa shrugging her feelings for Eren off and getting with someone else because close friends tease each other. I don’t think Eren had a character assassination on that front."
H-K_47,paspasapan,"I'd like to share my opinion too. I know it''s not going to get popular since there's so many more, but if just one person changes their mind about the final I'll be happy.

When I saw the ending this morning I felt confused, unsatisfied and somewhat angry like pretty much everyone else here. It just didn't make sense. I won't stay here enlisting what felt wrong because I'm sure you've been reading it all day, but I'll cite the main two: Eren being just Ymir's puppet and the disappearance of all titan powers like that.

I had to wait for the official translation to really start appreciating the chapter.
You probably had already got this, but if you didn't, let me try to make things a little better:
Eren has never been controlled by Ymir. We were right thinking he really was determined to go on with his plan.
I hope no one takes Ymir's ""search for Mikasa"" as a ""controlling Eren to get to Mikasa"", because it wasn't.
It was 

Eren 

knowing that the only way to stop the hating was to make eldian people regular human beings by eradicating the power of the titans using 

Ymir.

I'm sad seeing so many memes about Eren not knowing what he was doing, it's not true.

He did not become this monster just so that the allies could be shown as heroes to the remaining world, but also to have Mikasa break free from him, therefore showing Ymir that she had to break free from King Fritz, so that she no longer had to/could give power to eldians, which is Eren's goal.

Are you angry because Ymir's love for the king was nonsense?  Because it was unlikely? Because it was not foreshadowed?
We have been seeing Mikasa being a slave to Eren since the beginning. We have been seeing Ymir being a slave to the king since chapter 122. We have been questioning the reason why Mikasa kept following Eren for a long time. We have been questioning the reason why Ymir kept following orders by the royal family since chapter 122 (Was it that hard girl? All you needed was a hug? Couldn't you free yourself a little sooner?)
With hindsight, the similarities between Mikasa and Ymir look so evident, and it makes me love Isayama's storytelling just as ever. This is what Eren said to Ymir in 122, hugging her: ""You're no slave. You're no god. You're just a person. You don't need to serve anyone. You can be the one to choose"".
Now, imagine he's telling this to Mikasa. Doesn't it all make sense? Attack on Titan has always, literally always been about the pursuit of justice and freedom: that's something I'm not elaborating.
Who has been, from the dawn of time, the unjust slave? Mikasa. She is the centre of it all. The story is not even about her, such a slave she is. I's about her ""owner"".

It wasn't foreshadowed, it's true, but is it so hard to believe that Isayama actually wanted to give us this beautiful, precious piece of information at the very last? You really can't get over the idea that he did it to hurriedly fix everything? Does this look like his style? Hasn't he always done the opposite?
If you are feeling angry because you expected I don't know what from Eren, then I'm sincerely sorry!! Because there is a such a well-written ending to this magnificent story that you're not seeing and that I am still trying to understand.

There are still some things that don't feel 100% right:
• everyone realising out of the blue that Eren did this for their sake and kind of complimenting him? (•~•)
My guess is that he didn't just tell ""I did this for you all"" to everyone of his friends, but he actually had a long, intimate, personal conversation with each one of them;
• him sending Dina to kill his mother?
That's actually amazing, and proves the development this guy went through: sacrificing his mother was the only chance to let...everything, literally everything happen. (Also I'm not good with loopholes but it would have been a mess of he didn't, right?) Isayama could have dodged a bullet by not saying a word about it, but the reason he didn't makes me think it's actually worth something. Regarding Eren's hypocrisy when confronting Reiner and Berthold about his mother's death, there's none: before-rumbling-Eren knows nothing about it.
• historia's baby and everything about it that was said before?
I still haven't found a reason for it because, frankly (ー_ー゛), I kind of forgot how big of a deal it once was, seeing how intense things were getting, but 

during these 5 years of me following the manga, Isayama has earned not only my money, but also my trust.
Not the trust that he wouldn't have killed a character I liked, definitely not that, but the trust that he would write a good story, arc after arc, which he did. Not only I forgive him, I thank him.

If you read all of this, thank you.
I either:
• said something you already knew
• convinced you
• am about to start a nice, civilised debate with you if you disagree and feel like answering.

Really, thank you."
H-K_47,TasteLikeNom,"I used to hate Floch for being an asshole. But now I realize, Floch was the **CONSISTENT** asshole. When everyone else became tools for the plot, Floch stayed by his convictions to the very end. For the finale, we had:

**Eren:** Keeps moving forward until he reveals he never knew why he did it. The matricide with no cause.

**Mikasa:** Finally stopped loving Eren. 3 years later once again loves Eren.

**Armin:** Will never forgive Eren until he became a mass murderer for their sake.

**Ymir:** The slave bound by destiny turns to Stockholm syndrome plot twist.

**Annie:** Genocides Eldians but is now forgiven as the saviour of humanity.

**Reiner:** Genocides Eldians but is now forgiven as the saviour of humanity. Sniff edition.

**Falco:** Child soldier becomes plot taxi.

**Gabi:** Existed for 49 chapters and somehow contributed nothing.

**Pieck:** Chemical warfare on Ragako and now gets a happy ending.

**Karina:** Gets more panels than Ymir so she can say sorry to Reiner.

**Jean:** Cracking jokes in 45 pages that leaves so much unresolved.

**Connie:** Not relevant enough to become a slave to the plot. Forgives Eren too.

**Levi:** Badass who becomes wheelchair badass for no reason. 

&#x200B;

**Historia:** Was also here too I guess.

R.I.P. The true hero of Attack on Titan. You will never be forgotten Floch. You died before you could become a slave to the ending and like many others, that is ultimately why we love you so much."
H-K_47,None,"Reading the chapter again on much better typeset definitely improved the chapter for me. 














Starting off from the bad stuff first, my least favorite part of the chapter was the one thing I most dreaded for the ending that ultimately did happen. Eren made Dina walk straight past Berthold so the past could happen. Conceptually it's not too ridiculous that like in chapter 121 it was a necessity to make things happen for reality to align as it is. It's a heartbreaking revelation that is gonna make the ending of first episode hurt even more, but it was not fleshed out at all, only being done in a single page.













I feel sorry for Historia fans. I didn't care much about her post timeskip but still kinda bummed out that the convo in 130 never lead anywhere and that she basically got sidelined. on the plus side she did get a happy conclusion. Hate the fact that she didn't call her daughter ""Ymir"" or any other name at all. I hope the anime does her justice like they did with Lara Tybur's name.









As it turns out, the Attack Titan is the most tragic titan of all. On the surface it's a titan that strives for freedom. but in reality it's the least free of all. Other titans get specific abilities, but this one inherits a common philosophy and predetermined path. Kruger had to torture and titanize his fellow internment Eldians so that Grisha could get the titan and sneak into the walls. Grisha had to kill the Reiss family and give Eren the titan (for reasons that were never fully explained :/). Eren had to let Dina kill his mother, bully his dad into killing a family, kill ⅘ of the world, and get killed by Mikasa. In the end, despite his desire, Eren isn't free (maybe in his supposed bird reincarnation he is?). To others that may be be infuriating for understandable reasons, to me that realization seems fitting. Either way, being Eren is PAIN. 








Eren saying ""I wouldn't want her to love someone other than me, I want her to keep me in her heart for a long time. I don't wanna die!"" makes more sense in the better typeset. Yams is intentionally showing Armin and the audience that even though he's been through so much tragedy he's still a teenage boy with human emotions instead of being the stone cold killer that we wanted him to be. Yams once again reiterates the fact that Eren isn't someone special but just someone trapped in unique circumstances. His character doesn't get ""ruined"" by saying awkward inner feelings to his best friend.












I know others hate that the world doesn't get completely destroyed and the ending was too hopeful for a show like this, but it feels like kind of a reward for the characters after suffering so much through hell and beyond. 















Many people may hate how the alliance becomes ambassadors for peace but I like Armin's reasoning behind it. ""Conflicted will never be gone from this world, and hatred against groups of people will continue to exist. But when the world will wonder why people who used to be cutthroat enemies are now united together for peace, they would wanna know the story that lead to such a scenario"".










The Levi scene was fucking amazing. It was unexpectedly emotional seeing him saluting his comrades while shedding a tear. 











The story does end on a positive note, and it's fine if you hate it or think that it ruined the story for you. To me it was kinda rushed and left some questions unanswered, but not a bad ending. It had its downs but it had its ups, and the ending does make sense. I still love this story and am thankful that I got to enjoy it."

# Bootleg SAO ending, but worse.

*""Why she did everything? Who knows...no on can understand founder Ymir...""*   
*""She waited 2000 years for someone to free her...""*  
*""Mikasa freed her.""*   

Nope, sorry this just doesn't make sense.

Mikasa rebelled Eren AFTER the rumbling started. When Ymir broke free, Mikasa was literally fighting against the cart titan to save Eren as a good slave would.

Even if she could see the future with the help PATHS, why wait 2000 years? She could have been free from minute 0 instead of a mindless slave until Eren appeared in Paths.

&nbsp;

# Bootleg requiem of Zero, but worse.

*""***Armin:***So just like the tybur you did all this to drive the hate away from paradis...**""*  
-10 pages later-  
*""***Eren:***Why did i did this? I forgot...**""*   
*""***Eren:***Armin, it's time you leave, i am going to erase your memories...**""*  
 
The whole point of the requiem of Zero is to have a scapegoat TO USE for world peace.

Lelouch sacrificed himself AND told Suzaku and the rest about it so they could TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT to unite the world, but no one took advantage of it. Armin should have been the new helos for the world, and leaded Paradis with Historia and the rest. They didn't.

Also, the whole point of Lelouch's plan was to make THE WORLD hate him while THREATENING it, not destroying it! Eren already killed 80% of the world, if 10% is Paradis while the hell not just go and eliminate the other 10% so you prevent a future where everyone hates Paradis AGAIN?!

The last pages prove me right, Historia and the rest are STILL talking about peace negotiations, there is a HIGH chance in the future the world will retaliate against Paradis.

The cycle of hatred was not stopped, not even paused, peace is being NEGOTIATED.

&nbsp;

# More things that made no sense.

The rest of the chapter makes no sense.

Hallucigenia disappears out of the blue, just as it was winning?

Add it to the rest of things that make no sense:

* Why the mindless titans needed the sun to move?
* Dina was an irregular because Eren willed it, what about THE OTHER irregulars that have always existed and were more vicious mindless titans?
* Why Ramzi saw Ymir lauguing as he died if he was not an Eldian?
* Why the hallucigenia appeared out of the blue when Eren's titan was destroyed?
* why Eren appeared as another entity when the hallucigenia was supposed to be his spinal cord?
* Why Eren lost founding powers when his titan was destroyed? THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE!
* Why was not Eren in the neck of the founding titan, where all titan shifters are?
* The wall titans disappear, leaving no humans behind? Titans ARE humans, you can't make titans out of nothing!
* Why the hell the hallucigenia fought back if Ymir was in control all the time, why titanize Reiner/Annie and Pieck families?
* What Eren made grisha see that made him move forward?
* How could Mikasa have ""freed"" Ymir if in the end Mikasa is STILL a slave to her love and cannot move forward?

The list continues...

This post would be way longer if i started analyzing Eren's character and how it doesn't make any sense, so i'll summarize it:

Eren character did a complete 180º and it makes no sense, he never expressed that kind of pathetic, whinny and super-dependant love towards Mikasa, for a big part of the story he actually disliked not being a proper soldier like her and was emotionally distant towards Mikasa.

In his POV where he cries about Ramzi dead he thinks NOTHING like that of Mikasa. Even when they were kids he wasn't particularly attached to her, so pretend Eren was always a character so ""needy"" right now that benefits the story is TOO convenient and a sign of bad writting.

Most core characters for the resolution of the story did a 180º in their behavior actually.

&nbsp;

# Worst character portrayal of the entire story: Eren? No! Founder Ymir!

* She was made a slave when was a kid.
* She was tortured, her family murdered **[and her tongue ripped out.](https://i.imgur.com/VcsMEnb.jpg)**
* The king almost kills her with hunters, as she desperately ran for her life.
* The king decided to made her a breeding machine to create a line of titans (not his wife).
* While Ymir was **[taking care of her daughters](https://i.imgur.com/lxvlO3u.jpg)** the king was **[flirting with multiple with multiple women.](https://i.imgur.com/jI5rNct.jpg)**
* The king **[felt ZERO concern when Ymir was in the floor](https://i.imgur.com/QrNpsEZ.jpg)** after taking an arrow shot by a group of resistance soldiers.
* The king made her daughters eat her remains once killed.


AND SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM?! 

FOR 2000 YEARS DOING HIS WILL AS A WILLFUL SLAVE IN THE NAME OF ""LOVE""?!

ARE YOU JOKING ISAYAMA?!

That's beyond fucked up and a poor portrayal of a woman character. 

Even if Ymir was a slave all her life, are we supposed to believe that she was madly in love and at the same time was OK when the King she loved one had a FLIRTED WITH OTHER WOMEN IN HER FACE while she meekly stood there on the side? 

Are we supposed to believe that just because she was a slave she couldn't feel anger/jealously? Being a slave doesn't mean suddenly lacking emotions, emotions are the core part of a living being.

Only an incel would believe a woman would go to these lenghts for a man.

This seriously reads like a incel fanfiction of how women behave and how a woman would still be happily dutiful to a man that mistreats and cheats on her in her face because ""she knows that's her place"".

&nbsp;

# Final thoughts on the series...

I doubt the studio will go for an anime-original ending, so this is how shingeki no Kyojin ends.

Just because the first chapters were good i am giving it a 1/10 instead of a 0/10.

If you went to a restaurant, were served a magnificent appetizer followed by a pretty good dinner but an ice cream made of frozen poop as the dessert, would you still qualify the meal as good just because the first 2 parts were good? Endings are important.

It's not a tantrum because of the bad ending, i just can't rate higher a story that doesn't explain important plot points or if does it is with a *""who knows?""* and writes women characters as complete slaves with no will of their own or makes their role be a breeding machine (Historia/Ymir) to this extreme. 

Objectively speaking and judging it as a literary work, even if the start was fairly good it went downhill sharply.

**[Here is Shingeki no Kyojin manga page on Myanimelist, in case that want to rate this ""story"".](https://myanimelist.net/manga/23390/Shingeki_no_Kyojin)**

H-K_47,Vivienne_Yui,"Not the best chapter obviously but I did like it. There are several panels that I could put up as wallpapers in my room haha! 

I absolutely love the survey corps scene! And Sasha..it made me tear up. I love the panel of Armin and Eren together. I'm glad they had a final talk together. Its even nicer to see Armin stand up to the front confident and believing in himself. As a shy introvert, it took me years to do that. So it feels even better. I love Onayakopon-Levi-GabiFalco scene. Very wholesome. I love Histria back at her job even as a mom. The scene where she overlooks the sea is so badass! I love the bird imagery at the end.

So yeah there were so many moments I liked about it. I tend to be very optimistic and like bittersweet hopeful endings so maybe that's why my opinion differs from majority of this sub but I liked it.

Thak you for the story, Isayama. I know you just wanted to quit this as early as possible LMAO rest in your sauna lol. You got all my tears from the past 8 fucking years. I've never followed any series this long. Only AoT. Damn, I'm tearing up again..."
H-K_47,Bellad0nna_,"I-
This was one of the worst endings to a manga I’ve ever read???? So many plot holes. Levi was reduced to a man in a wheelchair being pushed by 2 kids he wasn’t even very close with??? Mikasa suffered for absolutely no damn reason when she should be happy with her friends and those she loves. Where the fuck is Ymir? What was the point of the importance of Historia having her baby? And why are they all praising Eren for committing mass genocide? Lmaoooo I cannot believe I wasted years of my life for this. It’s just Game of Thrones all over again. Felt rushed, lots of plot holes, Eren’s stupid and out of character expression of his undying obsession/love for Mikasa that he never once even showed throughout the manga really? Like what the actual fuck. He butchered every single character in one damn chapter. Fucking hell.

Edit: Actually, I take back the comment about butchering every character. Mikasa was obsessed with Eren and being close to him, but I don’t think she shouldn’t move on and be happy because he’s gone. Jean and Connie are my constants I love them so much and Reiner still having the hots for Historia was pretty funny. I wish Levi wasn’t in the wheelchair forever though and looking like Frankenstein. He deserves to walk/run again after all his sacrifice and losing practically everyone he ever loved while fighting for humanity. He did his good deeds for years why can’t he catch a break?"

H-K_47,tctony,"I know Eren comes across as a real Aaron Yogurt in this chapter, but I think if you look back at some of his past resolve you will find that he was a very troubled and hurt young man. He was tortured by memories of the past and future, blurred with the present. He saw a world without walls and without titans, and he moved forward until that was guaranteed. 

He wasn't a slave, he found his own meaning. Ymir was truly a God, and Mikasa and Eren wound up being the one to teach Ymir a lesson. But Ymir's will was on a different level, and overpowering. Eren put on a front in an attempt to protect his friends. 

I don't think Eren consciously decided ""oh lets go eat mom."" It just happened. Same reason it's not a plot hole for PATHS-Grisha to want to stop the rumbling (he's a more current version of Grisha, but the past events *already* happened). 

Anyway, just taking my acceptium. I maintain that this ending really needs a straight through re-read to fully be ok"
tctony,GoudaTanaka,"> I don't think Eren consciously decided ""oh lets go eat mom."" It just happened

Edit: Even the father of the protagonist does not have the balls to do what he has to do and the son has to fix everything.

For god sake, the part about Eren dying and turning into a bird happens too, only he turns into worms"
H-K_47,Kailobit,"I think this was the ending we got because Isayama never made clear how the power of the titans actually work and what he thinks about time and destiny. Without these much needed clarifications, the characters and the readers have no clue on what they should do or expect. Let me elaborate:

Ymir got the power from a strange creature and then died 13 years later. How can King Fritz know his daughters need to eat her spine to inherit the power? Why is the power split precisly in nine different parts? Why someone who inherits one of the shifters have to die 13 years later following Ymir's fate? Is this something she wishes for? We are never given any proper reason for all those ""facts"" and we are never shown someone dying because his time expired.

How could the survey corps stop a power that they didn't completely understand? No matter how hard they thought, they could never come up with a better plan than ""Let's kill Eren"". 

And how could Eren be sure that wiping off 80% of Humanity would change anything? It's not something you can just bet on and then feel sorry if it doesn't work out.

Regarding time and fate, there are only two options: either destiny exists and it is immutable, ""set in stone"", or it can be changed through characters actions. Isayama mixes the two options and makes a mess: Eren is both a slave to his future intention to activate the rumbling and a God who can redirect Dina's titan away from Bertholdt. Grisha, in the Path, warned Zeke about Eren's terrible plan, but decided to give his son the attack titan anyway shortly after.

Isayama and his not so well-thought take on titans and time was surely to disappoint us in the end, and I'm deeply saddened as a former huge fan."

H-K_47,Suspicious-Pirate497,"It's disappointing to see many people hating on the ending. Like everyone else, I've read and followed AOT for years, and this ending has concluded the story beautifully in every sense. While respecting those negative feedback, I think we should consider the following when evaluating the ending:

* As highlighted throughout the series, the theme of AOT is centered around freeing humanity from Titans (or more accurately, the fear of Titans) - that's why it's titled Attack on (or ""of"" depending on the translations) Titans. Eren has made such a promise in chapter 1 where he vowed to get rid of all Titans of the earth and delivered that promise in chapter 139. AOT is never about the war between Marley and Paradis, so who winning, in the end, shouldn't play any part in the story's conclusion. As we can see, the root of all evil deeds in AOT is from the fear of Titans (from both Marley and Paradis sides) so to ensure the humanity continuing to evolve safely, eradication of Titan through breaking the Ymir curse must be done.  And in order to achieve the goal; characters are required to make certain sacrifices of their human relationship/emotions. With Eren, it's his human emotions and desires regarding Mikasa, Armin, his family, and humanity. With Mikasa, it's her love for Eren. All those sacrifices are done to ensure the long-lasting survival of humanity - on both Paradis and the rest of the world.
   * Note: I see many people think the **Title** is translated as ""Advancing Titan"" or ""Attack Titan"". While it might be sound, the **title** translation (not the Titan **name**) (which has been confirmed by Isayama) should be understood as follows:
      *  進撃の巨人 is literally translated as ""Marching/advancing/charging at a full speed (in order to) attack Titans"". 
      * 進 (advanced) 撃 (shoot/fight) = charging intensely towards sth (to do sth).
      * の \[of (*for the name ""Attack Titan""*)/on (*for the title ""Attack on Titan""*\] 巨人 (big man/Titans) = on Titans/to Titans
   * Putting them together, the title is literally translated as ""Attack (verb)"" + ""of/on"" (preposition) + ""Titans"" (big man) suggests a fight against Titans - which truly summarizes the entire AOT theme.
   * If your argument is that the title should be translated as "" Attack Titan"". While it might be true, its meaning should be understood as ""Attack (verb) Titan(s)"" since plural/singular in Japanese referring to 巨人 is the same. Plus, it represents the entire theme more consistently. 
* The fear of Titans was originated from Ymir's desire for true love. I see people complain about this but I think the motif is very poetic and philosophical, and there is nothing wrong about yearning for true love. Isn't love the most essential human emotion of the entire universe? Would you ever exist or be brought to this world without love? Think about it! If anything, this motif just emphasizes how painful it is for Eren (and Mikasa) to sacrifice their selfish desires in order to save humanity.
* And because the AOT theme is heavily centered around humanity's freedom (from Titans), once the theme has been executed through the eradication of Titans, all other details are unnecessary to be further explored, such as the origin of worm-kun (lol), the identity of the farmer, Historia's significance (to be explained later), and others.
* I also see many people question how Historia's character got sidelined at the end but her character is never meant to be the central role of AOT universe. Her background details are only revealed as thematic references; her Royal blood and her relation with the Founding Titan. Supporting the AOT theme, her pregnancy plays two roles:   ONE - it's to ensure her long-term survival so she can lead Paradis politically in the post-Rumbling era,   TWO - her baby is the first baby to be born out of Fritz blood that does NOT have Titan power, breaking the cycle of Titan curse.
* I came across some questions about the reason of Rumbling. I think the last chapter explained very well there. It's meant to eradicate 80% of humanity so that Marley wouldn't have enough resources to invade Paradis in near future. Eren's plan was devised and operated very brilliantly.
* Regarding Eren killing the mother, I (may sound like a psychopath) have no problem with that. Given the AOT's theme, Eren must do everything he could to ensure humanity's freedom right? Having Berthold survive to be eventually devoured by Armin is a must. It's called sacrifice. Also, the original translation suggests that it might be Ymir who controlled that Titan to eat Carla but regardless, the reveal about Eren's mother's death doesn't ruin the AOT theme.
* People also criticize how Eren's changed for nothing. But if you really pay attention, Eren's never changed. He is always an emotional BUT highly calculative individual. And this has been shown since he's a kid all the way to when he's an adult. As a kid, he's shown to be cunning enough to kill 3 adults, and as a teenager, he was smart enough to direct Armin to deliver a speech that saved both him and Mikasa after his first Titan transformation. Eren has always been a smart/calculative yet emotional guy but we just fail to pay attention to those details.
* People are surprised at Eren loving Mikasa randomly. I honestly don't get how it's random. It's hinted throughout the series that Eren's fate with Mikasa is intertwined. The biggest hint is how Armin and others in squad 104 regard their relationship. No one ever considers them as siblings but lovers. When talking about Mikasa to Eren, she is referred to as ""Your Precious Mikasa"". The reason why Isayama doesn't explicitly illustrate intimate moments between Eren and Mikasa is that their relationship has been confirmed since the beginning, thus no need to add more details to persuade readers about their relationship, and plus AOT is not a shojo manga.
* Regarding the farmer's identity, I think the farmer is the most proper choice for Historia's partner. Why? Two reasons:
   * ONE, he's known Historia for the longest time more than anyone from squad 104. He's known her since they're little kids at the orphanage. Given how the time at the orphanage had so much influence over Historia (it's explained further in the manga), there must be a history between her and the farmer that is not revealed to us. And why Isayama's not revealed to us, well that's because she is just a side character, so her personal relationship shouldn't matter much.
   * TWO, since Historia's role, is the queen (and later military leader of Paradis), having a named character as her partner would ultimately overshadow her significance in AOT. Why wouldn't a queen marry a farmer? I'm sure if their story's ever told, it would turn out as beautifully as Eren/Mikasa as well.

Last, the ending begins a fair fight between Paradis and other nations - a fight without Titans. The war, of course, will never cease due to humanity's nature. Without Titans, Paradis is no longer manipulated by Marley and will be able to move forward for potential victory or even peace under Historia (and Armin's) leadership. The battle between humans can now begin.

AOT is not a textbook about how humanity should be evolved to, it's not a book about how the world should act to reach peace, nor about how morality should be maintained while preserving humanity's survival - if you want to learn more about those, read TEXTBOOKS, not AOT. 

AOT is a manga that simply tells us a story about how Titans have been manipulated, used, and exploited to do evil deeds and to get rid of these deeds, along with the curse of Titans being imposed on children for generations, the eradication of Titans must be done. **The universe we see in AOT will not end** once the story ends - it will continue to ""move forward"" - thus it's not designed to be **wholly** explored as AOT ends.

And the main character of this story, Eren, is never constructed to be GOD - he is not meant to provide the absolute outcome to humanity. He did what he thought was best. He's made to be very humane since the beginning.

In short, AOT takes us on a journey towards eradicating all Titans with Eren, Armin and Mikasa, to enable a new beginning where humans will fight using their own self-nature in the most possible humane way.

That's how ""Our Battle Has Just Begun"" (a message from Isayama's editorial team in chapter 139's last pages) means.

I hope everyone can read chapter 139 as objectively as possible so that we can appreciate and recognize the creator's intention all along. Isayama's made a promise ten years ago that the story of AOT begins with Mikasa/Eren and ends with them - and eventually, his promise has been fulfilled.

I'm glad to be born in this era to witness such a phenomenal piece of work like AOT and am grateful for being a part of this fandom. Let's all move forward beautifully - and respectfully together!"
H-K_47,lemmesay1stupidthing,"The thoughts are many, so the comment is really long, apologies:

**Eren**: is and always was a deeply broken person. If 138 didn't confirm it hard enough, 139 hammers it in using mfing Mjolnir: Eren always wanted to do the Rumbling, hated himself for it, and decided to let the SC become heroes as a result of it. He implanted goodbye memories into Armin and the SC (to be opened after my death xoxo) and then went into his own goodbye memory with Mikasa until he died. And thanks to the effect of his future memories/Paths, *even he* couldn't work out where it all truly began, and whether it ever could have turned out differently. Freedom broke Eren, and he broke everything else in pursuit of it.

**Ymir**: Ymir's warped perception of love made it impossible for her to be free. Right up until the end, she obeyed out of 'love', because 'obey' *is* 'love' to Ymir. But when she saw how Mikasa was able to both love and be free (she loved Eren, but was also 'free' enough to kill him), it inspired her to let go. And once she did, the power of the titans ended. Eren saw love as a shackle, and Ymir was shackled by love. Mikasa, though, loved and was free. By embodying both love **and** freedom in a way that Eren and Ymir never could, Mikasa was the one who was able to help Ymir sever herself from the world.

**Mikasa**: embodies this same duality during her final appearance. She's been on Paradis for the past three years with the Azumabito and Historia, but is also not a part of their ideology, as she's shown distant from all of it (via location, appearance, and (albeit dead) company). So she stands between two paths, as always (love/fear, humility/pride, freedom/slavery, beauty/cruelty, peace/violence), and it's not a stretch to imagine that she'll be a bridge between Eren-inspired Historia (couldn't ask for a more perfect match, indeed), and still-globalist Armin (Mikasa chooses Armin, again and again).

**Armin**: his reconciliation and goodbye with Eren was seriously heartwarming. Whereas Eren had abandoned all hope for himself, he invested all of it into Armin. Even Armin's eventual survival was only a result of Eren redirecting Dina Titan away from Bertholdt - and thereby causing Carla's death and beginning a cycle he got utterly lost in. Eren both doomed himself and saved humanity in that one action; Bertholdt living was the only reason Armin lived; Bertholdt living was also the only reason Eren saw Dina eat Carla.

And I don't think anyone envisioned this one: Armin and the Alliance living with the outside world before becoming the world's delegation of peace to their former home. It's almost a resumption of the final mission of Hanji's SC: crossing the sea (in fancy suits and all) to talk it out with the other side. Pays homage to Erwin, Hanji, and Armin himself all in one go. And Armin was the narrator after all.

**Levi**: at least one of the old SC got to survive, and it's fitting that it was 'just' a soldier who gave it his constant, unrelenting all, every moment of every day. He deserves the rest and the newspaper, and Falco/Gabi pushing him around London in a wheelchair. Hats off to the bloke whose whole personality and life was 'tatakae, tatakae'. Never had to say the words to embody the soul of the thing.

**Eren/Mikasa**: it took *literally the entire manga* (and his *death*) for Eren to admit that he loved Mikasa all along. Truly Isayama knows how to hold back the sails of a ship right before the gale. The bird is either Isayama's way of showing that SnK's dead live on in the ether, or Paths Eren dipping into the future for a minute. Since Eren's known for years that he's going to die, I can imagine that not confessing was his idea of 'sparing Mikasa', similar to how he doesn't want Armin to tell her that he wishes she'd keep loving him even after his death.

**Paradis**: Without titans, all possibilities of peace as well as war are open to them. But there's no true guarantee of either. This decision of Isayama's was good. Really good. (Apart from the Historia stuff, which . . . )

Kudos to **Isayama** on the end of his series, though. He carried this for eleven years and kept on giving. He envisioned a hell of a saga at the age of nineteen, whilst my greatest accomplishment at that age was learning how to cook eggs right. Big up to the man, he deserves it."

I don’t mind not getting every answer by the end, but the Hallucigenia and Wall titans disappearing off-screen when it was at the center of chapter 138 is just such a weird decision by Isayama. Ymir having Stockholm syndrome for King Fritz and revealing that all along she was manipulating Eren and actually waiting for Mikasa to save her... what? This isn’t even subverting expectations, it’s straight up ripping apart a great story that was almost finished. The panels of Eren crying and going full simp/incel for Mikasa in front of Armin left such a bad taste in my mouth too. Paths was too complicated of a concept for Isayama himself.

8 years reading this monthly to end like this. And to think we could’ve had The Mist ending. How great would that have been... from 10/10 to 7/10 for me. 130-131 doesn’t save this last stretch of chapters and Isayama’s mental gymnastics."

So this is it, I'll remember this manga as a great journey with literally no payoff, just a meh ending.

H-K_47,Raviolla,"every single outcome in this chapter i am FINE with, except for ONE THING (or two) THAT RUINS EVERYTHING

lets start off with what im fine with first and why i dont think eren's character was botched. so the ending goes like this:

1. it was revealed that eren did the rumbling because he knew the alliance was going to stop him and they'd be crowned as heroes. essentially, lelouch or some shit but not really. okay. this was a very predictable outcome nothing wrong so far.

2. eren's death and some kissy kissy boo boo shit that mikasa did rid the world of the power of the titans. alliance victory royale ended the era of titans. okay yeah, this was an obvious outcome and was literally BOUND to happen when the hallucigenia came out of eren's neck. very predicted.

3. eren was SERIOUSLY a slave to his destiny. it was revealed that everything was done for the sake of saving ymir and eren accepted this. the entire story happened in order for mikasa to save ymir apparently. the rumbling was for himself and for him to save paradis yes, but it was also for mikasa to do something that would save ymir, eren himself wasn't entirely sure what she'd do though.

THIS IS ALL OKAY. this is all predicted a billion chapters ago and makes sense with the story. i dont think eren's character was botched nor is he a fucking incel for mikasa. again, eren did all of this because he saw this as an inevitable outcome, all for ymir's sake. people are saying him letting dina eat carla doesn't make sense because shit could have been avoided grisha and dina coukd have rumbled together etc etc. how i interpret it was that THAT was also done for ymir's sake. that event was necessary for this whole rumbling shit with eren to happen yadda yadda yadda. also, ocean scene where eren 'simps' for mikasa. i didnt see it as a serious moment where eren's love for mikasa was the reason for the rumbling or anything. i saw it as a lighthearted moment revealing eren's true emotions and shit. because eren wasn't exactly doing the rumbling for himself, this was all for ymir. i don't think eren was going to half ass the genocide either and i don't think his dialogue meant he forgot why he rumbled. armin asked him 'why he did this' to which he replied 'i don't know why but there's something within me that made me do it'. it wasn't really that eren forgot why he rumbled. eren sees the rumbling as something he did for his desire for freedom, something he was born with. what he was referring to when 'he didn't know' was his horniness for freedom

essentially this chapter reveals that this entire story happened in order for ymir to free herself. he chose mikasa to do SOMETHING for ymir in order to free her from 2000 years of slavery. IT ALL RESTS ON YMIR...

**and thats where the problem lies because YMIR IS IN LOVE WITH HER FUCKING SLAVER.**

this story happened because ymir was in love with KING FRITZ. if this isnt a serious case of stockholm syndrome i dont know WHAT IS. i dont know what to say that thats just beyond fucked

okay okay lets try not taking eren's dialogue about ymir literally. maybe ymir's problem isn't necessarily about being in love with karl fritz. maybe it was just trying to find love in general. she sought love and she tried doing so again with royal blooded shifters and then eren showed her she can be loved by someone else not out of necessity of royal blood. she tried finding love again thru royal bloods by literally being a slave to them in the paths realm. its fucked, but it kinda makes sense. its a sad story about some slave girl trynna find love.

#but why the fuck is the resolution to this whole love situation mikasa kissing eren's decapitated head

WHAT. EREN SAID YMIR CHOSE MIKASA TO FREE HER BY DOING 'SOMETHING'. she was seriously waiting for mikasa to fucking kiss eren's head? WHY? 2000 YEARS OF SLAVERY JUST TO SEE A GIRL KISS A DECAPITATED HEAD? is it because ymir fell in love with eren but couldn't kiss him directly so he wanted someone real to do it or some shit? I DON'T FUCKING GET IT

please can someone try give logic and reasoning to ymir's character arc for me PLEASE. im literally okay with the outcome of the ending except for this ymir love bullshit, which is what the series was apparently ultimately about.

oh and the other thing i wasn't happy out was historia's character lol but thats for another comment

H-K_47,None,Can’t wait for the Boruto-like sequel where the centipedes invade earth  and are finally explained as space aliens
H-K_47,ElMondoH,"Ok, so possible interpretation here: 

* Eren in the typeset said ""My thoughts have become incoherent"", going on to explain that the things he saw through the Founder's power were timeless, inferring the visions were not in order and that he had to work to get through them

* He then noted that when he saw Bert, he somehow knew that it wasn't time yet for him to die. Who knows why?

* So he sent Dina past Bert. 

Tentative conclusion: It's not actually *given* that he sent Dina's titan to eat Carla. It may be possible that he didn't think it past ""Not time for Bert to die yet"", and because he was having trouble grappling with the sheer magnitude of the visions, he didn't realize that he was seeing the timeframe where his mother died? 

Anyone else see that as a possible interpretation of that scene? I mean, we've all been working with the presumption that Eren saw the future ***clearly***, yet in that one frame he noted that he's grappling with making sense out of it. My point here is that being prescient is not necessarily being omniscient."

H-K_47,okbuddybutbruh,Another problem with the few chps is how Love or Relationships were treated. King Shitz abused Ymir and she loves him?

Mikasa and Eren loved each other but Eren was dumb and dense af and never showed interest in her until it was too late and hurt her by his words. I know AoT isnt a romance but like....
H-K_47,None,"I feel Hollow? Disappointed? Not sure. But the one thing I'm sure is that how can I misjudge eren for 7 years and how can he just change in a single chapter. I rooted for his cause relating to his trauma and understanding of his character. Now it feels like my senses betrayed me, I failed to realise what his character actually was. He was one of my favourites of all time. To all the people, taunting us as we didn't catch up on his TANTRUMS from the very first, I ask you, compare every panel through 123 and 131 which has eren in it, with the panel of him and armin discussing the reasons of the rumbling in 139. I refuse to believe that, those previous panels gave you all the impression that *he was a child throwing tantrum just because mikasa friendzoned him*. I was here for the story, for all the developments, but just think about his reasons given in 139. How so many deaths could have been avoided.

 I agree in the most heinous ways, the ending makes sense, but to make sense of the ending Isayama sacrificed THE CHARACTER OF EREN AND YMIR. I hate character assassination with passion.

Every character feels OOC except Mikasa. As an eren fan,  seeing him turn into this in mere 45 pages was too much for me. Knowing that everything could have been avoided, so many deaths Could have been avoided, turning rumbling into a child's tantrum, who killed his mom just to achieve this, hurts so much.

I know I'm the minority in the fandom, but from today I completely detach myself from AOT, I can't seem to shake off the feeling of disappointment that I wasted so many years of my life invested in this. I won't watch part 2, no that pain will be too much to face again.

Thank you to everyone who agreed and atleast could reason with my takes in arguments regarding theories, I know none of it came to place, but it was fun discussing them.

Funnily enough I was the same throughout GOT S08 airing season, indifferent and hollow. But Aot hurt me more. This doesn't mean that I blv this ending is worse than GOT, but clearly I loved Aot much more. 

Atp, I think I will always be worried about any manga I read from here on. Ptsd will kick in. That's good to know."

I'm still in shock how bad the writing for this chapter is. I'm baffled that anyone can defend this trash. Major plot points are left completely unexplained and hand waved with ""I felt like it"".

 https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/mormvp/erens_confession_nonincel_version/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Then I honestly would've been perfectly happy with the ending, albeit the part about ymir kinda came outta of nowhere but I don't entirely mind it for the sole reason that Ymir just couldn't and didn't understand love and if she did it was in an obsessive, toxic, and amalgamated version of it. I have qualms about Eren not knowing why Mikasa was the person Ymir chose but I like to think that Mikasa's unconditional love for Eren reminded Ymir of herself and her ""Love"" for King Fritz (I guess they have the same names now too) but anyways if isayama's editors or whoever was helping with dialogue/translation just rewrote a couple of those panels and perhaps if yams had also drawn some new ones to match said rewordings then I believe a majority if not everyone would've loved the ending.

Me personally I'm not too sure what to think, I've read at this point perhaps dozens of opinions ab it here on reddit and hundreds of memes and complaints from Twitter just to see what people thought and lemme tell ya its a mixed bag of both people hating it furiously, loving it to death like the chainsaw man ending and then there's people like me who are kinda confused and in the middle.

I think after a little bit of time and processing I can accept the ending and make the best of it cause I know and I hope all yall also know that Isayama poured his heart and soul into creating this Manga masterpiece for us to enjoy over this past decade. I only started reading the manga back in January but I was an anime only from when it first came out and waited and enjoyed about a good chunk of my memorable life on this Series. It was one of my first Anime after SAO (God forbid) and it will always hold a special place in my heart no matter how the ending turned out.

Why ruin any nuance? Dina eating Eren's mom is tragic enough and left room for some speculation, just so obtuse to say ""nah he killed her cus time travel"". 


I loved 138's moment between Eren and Mikasa really felt like the perfect way to conclude there story, Mikasa  can move on knowing that's what Eren wanted.   


The whole conversation betwen Eren and Armin was dumb, cut all of that.   It makes sense Eren doesn't want Mikasa to move on, but that doesn't need to be said so explicitly when nothing in the show is ever 
that simply worded. 


That whole conversation seemed like the perfect time to have Armin stand up to Eren, actually confront him for his actions.  Armin and Eren have never agreed philosophically, why not have Armin push back at Eren, it's way more inline with his character development and would lead us to believe he's becoming the leader he's suppose to be.  They can't still have a heart felt good bye, I would just rather it be ""I still love you, I can't support your actions, but you've given us freedom, thanm you"", smth like that.  


I just like this better, Eren sees the future realizes this is his best chance at freedom for himself and the people he cared about, he doesn't stop them from killing him because they're finally free to do so.  Boom, that's it, it's tragic, harsh, and shines a glimbse of hope for paradise. 


If the anime chooses to stop at 138, I would fully support it."

H-K_47,everyday_lurker,Im surprised this thread is still getting frequent comments. I guess thats to be expected for a final chapter thread but still
H-K_47,KynoSSJR,Saw a “only Ymir knows” comment on two different subs today. So proud of some of this community
H-K_47,Voolii,"Hello. There is a theory I was thinking about and I want to share it with you and I'm going to explain all the foreshadowing in the manga. I'll start with what's happening in AOT world and after that I'll show some proof to back up the theory .

In AOT world we are certainly dealing with time loops. I'll start with this; Eren Kruger said to Grisha Yeager "" When you get inside the walls, you should start a family , love someone inside the walls. If you can't we are doomed to repeat it all again. The same history. The same mistakes. Again and again. If you want to save them all , Mikasa, Armin, and the others … carry out your mission to the end."" Manga chapter **89**

All the time manipulation starts the moment Eren has connected with Zeke and saw Ymir in the path world (The world that Ymir was living in it for thousands of years\*\*(1)**)** and asked her to lend him her power. As we know attack titan has the power to **transcend time** and can affect the past by showing the specific future memories to the owner of the attack titan(2)\*\* and in this process the future will be changed for sure because of the new past. On the other hand with founder power, one can control all Eldians and even titans and in that specific moment Eren has both power at the same time so its logical to think he even can change other people memories in the past to some degree by combining these 2 powers together\*\*(3)**.** Now with this new power Eren starts to altering the past so he can find the way to free himself , Ymir and his friends from titans and the threat of the outside world. With the nearly **infinite amount of time** that Eren had in the path world(4)\*\* its safe to assume he saw nearly all the futures he can create by altering the past. Now as for how the time loop works in AOT universe, either he lived all alternative reality or just sending the memories and information back in time and see the result(future) by following it in the path (branches of the spiritual tree in the path world)**(5)**. By doing so he finds the best future\*\*(6).\*\* Now one of the most **important** part and I think The final part of this future that he wanted to create was when he and Mikasa choose to ran away in Marley. That’s the important part for 2 reasons, first because with living with Mikasa for 4 years, finally Mikasa could understand that **this is not the way**. By living with Eren all their friends will be doomed and that’s what they both don't want at all **(7)**. Second it will explain **how chapter 138 and 1 are connected to each other** and why is the chapter 1 is named ""**to you, 2000 years from now**"". With the math that you can find in Gamebeat's video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDQPJWHu0Qk&t=308s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDQPJWHu0Qk) ([5:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_M3AbrbQSs&t=309s))**(8)** we know 1996 years has passed since Ymir got her power. In year 854 Ymir gave her power to Eren and Eren had only 4 more years to live. In the Mikasa's memories(chapter 138) Eren and Mikasa lives 4 years(4+1996=2000) with each other and when Eren died Mikasa said ""See You later"" and we are back in the chapter 1 (exact scene is in chapter 1 when Eren woke up), the final loop exactly after 2000 years\*\*(9)\*\* . Now this is the current time line we are in. Eren sets all things the way he wanted. He lived throgh all time loops to find the one that breaks titan curse and give his friends a chance so they can have future. In this final loop he only needs to advance and move forward. He doesn't need to change anything anymore because he did choose this path that’s why this time when he kisses Hystoria's hand he know that this is the final loop and there is no changing it. He needs to do the rumbling, that’s what he's planned.

**Proofs and some explanations** : **(1):** Time flows in the path world is different . As Zeke said to Eren in chapter 120 "" what takes place here passes in a flash out There"" and he also said he waited for Eren for years. Now imagine how long Ymir is living in that world when 2000 years has passed in reality . **(2):** That's exactly what Zeke said to Eren in chapter 121 and we saw how Eren changed his father's action **(3):** For instance one can change how Elidans body work or changing their memories or as we saw in chapter 139 he was the one who has saved the Bertholdt by controlling Dina fritz. **(4):** see the (1) explanation **(5):** its like the movie X-Men: Days of Future Past. I think the latter is better explanation. It must be like this, every time he changed something in the past he could saw the result in the path. Eren didn't travel back in time he was just changing the past and see the result after that because all the past, present and future are happening at the same time in the path world. So Eren has enough time to see and play all scenario and all of these came to this conclusion whether to kill most of the people of the world and free himself and his friends from titans and give his friend a chance to have a future or something like Zeke's plan that eventually end Eldian blood line. Btw consider this, when you have memories of all this alternative reality its same as you lived in all of them. **(6):** The best future considering Eren's feeling. In my opinion killing people is very wrong. It's really messed up BUT tell me if u ever have to choose between your family and the rest of the world , which one will you choose ? I bet 100% of people will choose their family even if their family are guilty. So in Eren eyes killing the whole world for his family's and friend's future was the best and only way. He said that many times in the manga, to Zeke and even to Hystoria. In chapter 100 Eren told Reiner ""I just keep moving forward until my enemies are destroyed"". He was disappointed in the people outside the island. They only thing they brought Eren was dead and suffering. This manga is not about who is good and who is evil. As he said to Reiner ""I'm like you"". And about Zeke plan, he choose to ran away, he wants to erase all Eldians so they don't suffer anymore!! But Eren choose to fight and advance forward so maybe someday his people gain the true freedom. Anyway at least his people are free from the titan's curse. **(7):** Mikasa killed the one man she truly loved because she knew there is no other way around it. After living with Eren for 4 years they were full of regrets because all their friends were doomed. Mikasa choose the path that Ymir didn't have the courage to choose and after Ymir sees the Mikasa's action she got freed from her own curse. **(8):** you can find the time line of events in AOT here.([https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline)](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbFVBVlNwWk11OHlMNkxlRExydHdTT2RUM2MyZ3xBQ3Jtc0trZ2NWN1ZYMG1USXBCWGlYdDduMG5aQ1pwTjIybHR2ZzkyTDhkVC1BYUpTNnFvUVlwa0ZBTkxxTUUwUi03aG5FaGlYX2tjUUpZVG81SFppNHFMSzAzSjhtd3N6eDZiQmFmd21ndTFkY0xQOUZjVXJNOA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fattackontitan.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FTimeline%29&stzid=UgypuoJZoHR5uP57Kgl4AaABAg) I checked the math, and it's correct. If Eren lives his 4 final years then exactly 2000 years have passed since Ymir got the titan power. I don't think it's a coincidence to connect chapter 138 to chapter 1 which it name is "" to you, 2000 years from now"" after exactly 2000 years. **(9):** Let me explain this. Why this is truly a time loop? Why Mikasa has headache nd what was all those dreams ? In the manga and OVA of lost girls there are some foreshadowing that if we add to the foreshadowing and the hint we find in the manga that I explained earlier will complete our theory. The manga shows when Mikasa believes that Eren is killed by a titan, she saw a blue butterfly and then she saw a dream or maybe a memory or even more accurate the alternative reality. In the dream she is living with her parents in the world similar to AOT world but this time they didn't get killed. She find Eren and fell in love with him. Eren is the same ! always seeking the freedom and in the end he died when he was saving Armin from crashing in to the wall with the airplane. First let me explain what is the meaning of the butterfly here. It refers to butterfly dream.(Zhangzi's butterfly dream) which the concept is about alternative reality. Even when Mikasa woke up from it, she wasn't sure she was dreaming. She even say ""I remember the pain again"" , ""do I have to start all over again"" ! we see the similar situation in chapter 138 . headache, dream and starting all over again in chapter 1 ! and the most important part is in all of them Eren is going to die. Even the man with mirror mask said to Mikasa ""no matter what world you go to, you can't avoid Eren's death""""that's because Eren carries death within his body"" and he even tell her ""you have to become stronger, and go back to the previous world"". So when Mikasa believes that Eren is dead or is going to die (chapter 138) the memory from another reality (becasue of the time loop) kicks in. She remembers the feeling because she experienced it(loosing Eren) many times. The headache can be resurfacing the memories from another realities because of the time loop. Now why Mikasa remembering these memories is either because Eren or maybe Ymir shows them to her so she can do the right thing when the time comes (chapter 138) or because of her Ackerman blood. Because they are immune to founding titan brainwashing or Because when they awakened the Ackermans gain the battle experience from every single Ackerman before them via paths, so maybe she can have some access to her another lives memories."

H-K_47,Mausal21,"i wanna like this finale. i really do. 

i appreciate *some* of what it does (framing Armin as the ‘narrator’ of sorts, going for an Evangelion type of thing with PATHS, and leaving an interesting world up for interpretation) but MY GOD is everything else so meh. the justification for Ymir being ‘hehe woman in love!!!’, Hallu-chan conveniently disappearing, Eren suddenly being, like, really in love with Mikasa (which could’ve worked had there been more build-up!), everyone coming back to life, and brushing off the fact that Eren changed the past in a couple of panels. though the biggest offender, for me, was the on-the-nose dove symbolism with Eren. for a series that had been so good with it, that’s just so disappointing. 

look: it’s not awful, it’s just *decent*. it felt very rushed, but it had its touching moments and, though leaving lots of things unanswered, it feels like an ok conclusion. however, for a series that always seemed to be 3 steps ahead of the viewer/reader, this just feels kinda disappointing. definitely wish it was better, but i’m glad Yams at least got to tell the story he wanted to tell.

I’ve been madding for the entire day but now that I saw the part of eren’s mind blending past present and future, it’s really not bad, moreso tragic. I interpret it as S1-3 Eren speaking with Armin, not Eren on his deathbed (since he’s psychologically shattered in this scene). So yeah, it’s pathetic, in a tragic way, but it’s not character assasination. I have not read the rest of the chapter though, since I haven’t been spoiled on it, so I cant speak for the situation IRL; I just don’t think Yams massacred Eren like I thought he did an hour ago."

StrayGod360,edgyguy115,"Huh, interesting. I wonder why."
StrayGod360,kajigger_desu,"The whole character of Lara Tyber makes sense if we consider that the warhammer titan is traditionally the executioner of Fritz Kings. 

The Fritz rulers we can assume were for the most part tyrannical. Execution is an important would be an important part for them. We know that the other squabbled with each other for power, and the Founding titan had to keep them in line and keep themselves safe with the help of the Ackerman clan. But what if for symbolic and efficiency purposes they had a titan loyal to them to execute the rebelling titans when they needed? Thus the warhammer titan. We saw in the episode that Tyber was able to chunk Eren's upper titan body pretty easily, leaving Eren's normal body available for the next attack. The Warhammer titan has used its abilities to perfect killing other titans. This also makes sense as to why the Tybers were in kahoots with Fritz about the memory wipe and wall plan. Fritz needed a trusted titan family to understand that, and safely preserve the efficacy of the plan, and he could only trust the Tybers, his personal executioners.

Which is why Lara asked for Eren's last words because she was ready to kill him (despite that not fitting with Marley/Magath's military goals), as her job is the executioner."

If he didn't at least suffer, it's like there's not justice at all. Remember how Marco died? I like he has a guilty conscience and I don't feel sorry for him at all."
too_many_universes,sunrisepeace,"I had the same idea about him before understanding about his life as an eldian in marley, his mother and the government of marley in general forced him (who was just a little kid at time) into a brainwashed warrior who saw Paradisians as devils, he wanted to save the world from the devils, you gotta see the world from his perspective, after breaching the walls and spending years within paradis he was broken because he had realized there were no devils inside the walls but he couldn't come into terms with his warrior side which eventually led him into two personalities. He had a dream of becoming the saviour of the world, which was not even a thing after realizing how corrupted the aot world is...he is a product or better to say victim of a society that used him to achieve their objectives (founding titan), after returning to Marley he was considered a hero by at least Marley's Eldians, but only he knew he was nothing but a broken guilty soul, that's why he is trying to end his life...

Grievous_Nix,LordSuz,UK how screwed the character's state is when u want him to die for his own good
LordSuz,lokemon_35,UK? What are you? Bri'ish?
lokemon_35,StrayGod360,UK = You know
LordSuz,TheFebrezeWizard,That’s like half the cast for me at this point
LordSuz,StrayGod360,He deserves peace.
LordSuz,veImouth,He can't die. He is immortal.
veImouth,JsRyuzaki,He's an immortal vampire
LordSuz,AnitaMiniyo,"Yes...

The only other way I can think of is that Eren wiped everyone's memories so Reiner doesn't remember anything, but if they break the curse I doubt that would happen."
AnitaMiniyo,Farobek,He can't wipe the memories of non-Eldian folk
Grievous_Nix,No-Seaweed-4456,I guess Reiner found a purpose in life by shipping his cousin with Falco
No-Seaweed-4456,Electronic_Issue_978,"Had to remove the link because of the shit that's starting. 

I noticed that this got a lot of upvotes, if you enjoyed that story but didn't favorite it then message me and I can give you the link in a chat >!(as long I'm not asleep or at school)!<."
Electronic_Issue_978,No-Seaweed-4456,Not enough Titan violence and depression. 0/10
Electronic_Issue_978,None,LMFAO
Electronic_Issue_978,sarange,It was kind of cute but where was Reiner in this?
Electronic_Issue_978,No-Seaweed-4456,No I mean he canonically set Falco up. He said “you’re gonna save Gabi”. He’s basically a matchmaker at that point.
Electronic_Issue_978,shrek500_2,I am visibly disgusted and going to kill myself. Guess that’s what I get for watching 1 anime
Grievous_Nix,ElxaDahl,"IDK. Kinda weird that instead of wishing for the suicidal dude to find happiness, we are hoping he dies to find peace"
ElxaDahl,Tryndamere_Main,"The man has been through an absolutely unimaginable amount of trauma in his life that is I personally don't believe any human being can get past (committing mass genoicde, living a split life for years, lost all three of his companions, and watched his own home get genocided). Suggesting that someone can casually move on from that and find happiness on the other side is naïve at best. And most importantly, Reiner only has 2 years left to live anyway since he inherited his titan when he was 10 and he's 21 now. At this point, I just don't want to see the guy suffer anymore. He's gonna die soon anyway no matter what."
Tryndamere_Main,ElxaDahl,"I know what you're saying. The man probably hasn't been happy since he became a warrior candidate, that's why I hope that he finds some sort of happiness before the curse gets him if he somehow survives the rumbling."
Tryndamere_Main,Ishikii,Damn he probably got in the army when he was 6 years old or something
Tryndamere_Main,IndigoGouf,"> Reiner only has 2 years left to live anyway since he inherited his titan when he was 10 and he's 21 now.

You say this as if the shifter powers being destroyed/the curse getting lifted isn't one of the most likely things to happen no matter the ending."
Tryndamere_Main,throwawayyyyoo,I honestly think the 13 year curse is gonna get lifted
ElxaDahl,Slayer196,"There's not a lot of happiness to look for in their world, even less for a titan shifter I suppose"
ElxaDahl,None,"He's gonna die soon anyway, let him find whatever peace he can."
ElxaDahl,Drago957,Well tbf he did help to commit genocide
Grievous_Nix,brenguyeno,"I just want him to be happy, at least give him a chance of being loved and appreciated like during his times in the Scouts before he goes out. He's been through too much😭😭"
brenguyeno,Lightbringer34,"Reiner deserves to be loved, honestly. He needs someone to see him, war crimes and all, and tell him he’s someone worth knowing as a person."
Lightbringer34,brenguyeno,"It's not likely, but I hope if the 104th cadet corps survives they'll bring Reiner back in to their friend group to forgive him and have a bonding moment. He's done horrible things but it pains me to see the regret and suffering he's going through, all because of things he did as a brainwashed child. Deep down Reiner is a person that just wants to help others, he always puts others ahead of himself, and I hope by the end of the story he can finally be the hero."
Lightbringer34,No-Seaweed-4456,That’s probably why they set up Karina having a change of heart at Fort Salta and saying how horrible of a mother she was and trying to understand the Paradisians.
brenguyeno,No-Seaweed-4456,The parts of him looking at the candidates like his old warriors friends always tugged at my heartstrings. I just want him to survive so he can see his remaining candidates live happy lives.
No-Seaweed-4456,Treyman1115,Well one of them is living like Patrick Star I'm sure they're happy about that
brenguyeno,pinecone4506,I want that for him too
brenguyeno,AtomicKittenz,"Nah fuck that. Reiner needs to die for his stupidity and crimes against all humanity. Why should he get to be happy for what he did? I personally want him to be tortured physically and mentally some more.

Edit: I don’t care. I hate Reiner"
AtomicKittenz,RealJooJ,POV: You didn't watch/understand Attack on Titan.
Grievous_Nix,justk33psw1mm1ng_,"I don’t want Reiner to die. I really, really, really don’t. But when he does, I want him to die knowing at least one person actually cared for him, and saw him as a good person despite everything he’s done."
justk33psw1mm1ng_,riuminkd,"Well, Ymir, Falco and Gabi mostly fit your description."
riuminkd,SovietBerlin,Also Bertholdt and maybe Marcel
justk33psw1mm1ng_,hdhdhya,If he does die I hope I'll get the same feeling I did when Hange died. IDK what it was but it wasn't sadness even thou I loved them so much
Grievous_Nix,Kilo_G_looked_up,"Last chapter: ""Hey, Eren undid the curse of Ymir, you get to grow old, Reiner!"""

Kilo_G_looked_up,johnfreemansbrother,"Lol we know Isayama has shown he can troll, but this would be the ultimate."
Kilo_G_looked_up,san_19,this actually could be possible
Kilo_G_looked_up,PainfulHuman,Isayama loves and hates reiner at the same time
Kilo_G_looked_up,None,fuck.
Grievous_Nix,1xonly,Reiner is my absolute favorite character and I am ready to see him die at this point. I’d like to see him going out saving Gabi and/or Falco and then finally being able to rest.
1xonly,ranstalli0n,He needs to be Helos first.
Grievous_Nix,None,"Reiner is still a great character tho, one of the best"
Grievous_Nix,torch_7,Saddest part is that it all started because Reiner was guilt tripped by his mother to become a warrior.
torch_7,throwawayyyyoo,THISSSS
torch_7,Kulhoesdeferro,"Tbf if you're an Eldian in Marley chances are you've been guilt tripped by your family already.

Also everyone's talking about Reiner but my boy Grisha is the real MVP. He probably endured more than Reiner ALL while being alone. In fact I see Grisha mentioned so little that I'll start a cult to spread his name"
Kulhoesdeferro,torch_7,"Personally, I think Grisha is just the same as Eren, he got radicalised by the murder of his sisters, but just like Reiner was done, he tried to indoctrinate Zeke instead of being his father, which didn't work out."
Grievous_Nix,EDNivek,"Eren gonna give him one last ""gift"" by ending the curse of Ymir"
Grievous_Nix,None,"I've liked Reiner since the beginning so I can't relate to the first part. But the second part, yeah, the man has had it rough, he needs to rest, but I don't wanna see him go."

AkashZaman,gAcksaurio,Except killing directly and indirectly a lot of people from Paradis :/
gAcksaurio,magicalmaestro8,Literally everyone even somewhat involved in the story is guilty of that.
Grievous_Nix,ArtyShitLord,Why is Reiner still here? Just to suffer?
Grievous_Nix,Treyman1115,Damn this is actually way too accurate.
Grievous_Nix,sese2003,"Considering the fact that Reiner nearly shot himself in the face, i have to ask:

Is there any therapy in Marley, or is that not a thing that exists out of fear of saying something that sounds anti-Marley government  and being turned into Titan?"
sese2003,Everdale,"We saw Dr. Yeager received mental care as a result of this trauma, so I assume there is something similar available in terms of therapy too."
sese2003,None,"There’s a hospital in Liberio that treats traumatized patients who were sent from War, mostly Eldians.

Dr Yeager (Eren’s Grandpa) was there too."
sese2003,Aries2397,I mean they wouldn't exactly send a warrior to therapy if they find out its having suicidal thoughts. They would rather immediately have the warrior eaten by the next candidate.
Grievous_Nix,Teofilo-,"First we wanted him dead because we hated him, now we want him dead cause his whole existence is just pain and suffering. That’s sad"

Grievous_Nix,None,i feel so bad for him lol
Grievous_Nix,gau-tam,"Like smone said the other day, Reiner in S4 is to show us that Levi made the right choice letting Erwin die in S3.

None,Chompers22,"Okay, so, who else do you think deserves to die?"
Chompers22,None,"Well deserves implies I think they need to die because they’re horrible. Reiner and a couple of other characters evade death so much it’s damn near inevitable. That’s what I mean really, like Reiner if you’re going to die then do it, but if not then okay I guess. I don’t really know how to explain it, like it’s when that kid keeps leaning back in his chair and everyone waits for him to fall but he keeps getting close. You want him to fall every single time but he doesn’t deserve it, it’s like if it happens it happens. Better him fall early on then keep dragging the nerve wracking show on. I can’t really understand it myself but I hope this sort of helps you understand how I feel."
Grievous_Nix,Dmachi23,reiner is bitch made😂😂😂😂
Grievous_Nix,Gojira19922,Reiner is hard to kill

nan,pinznneedlez420,"i apologize if this is very ignorant/stupid, but what are you guys talking about and referring to in regards to this post? 

currently, i am just reaching volume 6 of Hajime's original version of AOT manga, and i have not yet watched the anime. could someone possibly, without giving me any spoilers, explain whats going on? whats all this about plagirism and different versions and different countries? are you guys being satirical and/or sarcastic, or are you being fully serious? 

again, i am sorry to ask what is likely an idiotic question, but i figured youse could prolly explain it much better and much more succintly than a frantic Google search (in which i may also inadvertently encounter spoilers). 

in terms of my familiarity with manga in general, i am just getting to be a bit of an avid reader after a very long hiatus; i also do not watch that much anime yet, simply because i would really like to finish reading the original mangas before i begin the animes. i say this to also say please no spoilers of other jawns. 

anways, yeah, if someone would be willing to please give me a rundown of everything thats going on, i would be truly, madly, deeply be exceedingly grateful. 

i will also apologize once more for what is undoubtedly a lot to ask, and i therefore understand if no one is willing, and/or thinks poorly of me asking. i intend to do research of my own, but as it seems everyone else is familiar with this situation, i figured id just give it a shot. 

thank you for reading, sorry for the novel.

When else has the plot armour came?"
TonyMini,DefiledSol,"He’s kinda the most plot armoured character in the series next to Reiner.

In Trost arc: Saved by Eren even though he logically should have been swallowed long before Eren got there given where we were shown Eren and the titans positions. (There was an additional minute long flashback during that time.) Saved by Pixis’s sudden arrival after he failed to TNJ the general.

In the Female Titan arc: Spared by Annie cuz reasons. Didn’t obtain any real injuries even when he was knocked meters into the air as Annie swatted his horse.

In Armoured and Colossal Titan arc: Was given a good minute to just rant at Bertholdt about Annie getting captured. Both Reiner and Bertholdt just stood and listened even when Reiner could have easily captured/killed him in that time frame.

In Return the Shiganshina arc: Survived 60 m fall with bones that were probably turned brittle due to the intense heat. Even if he survived the fire, Every bone in his body would probably break on impact. That is to say nothing about tissue damage.

Rumbling arc: For some reason was shot in the mouth instead of the head by Samuel and Daz. For some reason was not instantly killed/eaten by the Titan that took him hostage. For some reason did not suffocate to death inside its mouth. For some reason entered PATHs and got help from some random Titan shifters that Ymir decided to liberate from her control for whatever reason. All the while, the literal Titan god, Eren Yeager, who could honestly just tell him to die if he wanted to and it would happen, does not actively fight and just sort of does nothing."
TonyMini,Ryan-Only,well it's same as Naruto. at first ppl said it ironically and some took it seriously and slowly the amount of ppl taking it seriously increased by alot

Soul_theorist,Rintohsakabooty,everyone here has naruto in their heads
Charlie-77,DumplingsInDistress,I am reminded of Shinra in Fire Force. The ultimate Talk no Jutsu worst practitioner. Failed in all of his Talk no Jutsu in all other pillar.
DumplingsInDistress,None,Shinra is incredibly based tbh
Charlie-77,orange_dust,"I mean to be fair, Talk no jutsus are shonen clichés that wouldn't really work in a more realistic setting, no villain would change their whole world perspective on the spot just like that. I think Armin did decently for what he was given and the reactions of those people are actually how real humans would react to being Talk no Jutsu'd. The officer had pretty much abandoned his ability to think rationally, Annie and Berthold had their whole warrior past and mission which they wouldn't give up just like that and so on."
Charlie-77,None,It worked with Zeke though.
None,BiDiTi,And it worked on Ymir!
Charlie-77,redeyedcyborg,"Oh boy I love the memes and simping after piece, but I have so much to say and don't wanna say it cause of uneeded arguments."
Charlie-77,riuminkd,"Well, tnj against Annie was just a long con"
riuminkd,JoelMahon,I think they mean in taking her underground
Charlie-77,blood_pearl,"People don’t call Armin naruto just because of his talk-no-justu, they call him Naruto because of his plot Armor, power of friendship & dead Nakamas helping him, just like Naruto, also Armin did that Naruto style entrance in ch 137. (Naruto posed with Giant toads and Armin with titans). 

I believe people are cringed by how Armin is glorified as a hero in the chapter, when most work is done by literally everyone else (Zeke summoned dead Nakamas, Reiner, pieck and Jean worked their asses off to stop that parasite) but Armin just enters like Naruto and transforms... that’s it."
blood_pearl,Charlie-77,"
>they call him Naruto because of his plot Armor, power of friendship & dead Nakamas helping him, just like Naruto

I can't tell if this is an ironic reply or an unironic one lol"
blood_pearl,Ryan-Only,"well, ppl aren't cringed. they are just milking the meme with irony. those who are cringed need some special treatment or either they are eren simps who wanted eren to be in highlights"
blood_pearl,None,i dont think Naruto has the power of friendship and dead nakama maybe youre confusing it with fairy tail and his talk no jutsu is mostly acceptable. He has a bit of plot armor for sure though
Charlie-77,ReinersTongue,I haven't watched Naruto but I thought people loved Naruto
ReinersTongue,None,"Yes we do mostly, that doesn't change the fact he's talk no jutsu master."
Charlie-77,straywolfo,"Eren TNJ Ymir, Erwin TNJ new recruits : wow yeaaaah 😂😂🤡"
Charlie-77,Bold_Barristan,"And yet he succeeded in a very large number as well
-Pixis
-Annie twice actually
-Reiner and Magath
-Zeke
-previous shifters
-Mikasa!!! Has made her willing to go along with this plan"
Charlie-77,None,that's why Armin's finally succeeding in the last was out of the blue and in my humble opinion bad
None,OhMilla,I mean why would he not finally succeed? What's the point of him failing 1000 times? just to fail another? There's such thing as becoming better through the failures.
None,TonyMini,"But Armin didn't tnjed Zeke, Zeke realised himself and if you really think Zeke wouldn't have done this after Armin's talk then please explain why. It's not like Zeke was in full on battle mode when Armin just came out of nowhere and said ""don't fight"", he was totally depressed and sad after his humiliating defeat by Eren. And one more thing I wanna ask, when have you joined titanfolk?"
None,ILoveWesternBlot,"I think it's about the precedent that's been set. Talking it out has been Armin's preferred way of handling conflict, but has failed every time except when used as a distraction or to throw someone else off mentally (tricking annie into thinking she killed eren to make her hesitate and prevent jean's death, pissing of bert so erwin could retrieve Eren). The series has established its a poor strategy most of the time, which means for it to work you would need a really good, really convincing talk for readers to accept it.

I don't think the zeke-armin convo was bad, conceptually it was really good and made sense for the characters, but it felt like the sparknotes summary of a longer convo. We should have had at least a full chapter where zeke gradually changes his mind and that would have probably been more satisfactory, like all of Armin's past failures finally culminating in success for the first time, but that would have been impossible with how much panelspace is left. Feels like yams kinda painted himself into a corner with this arc's pacing unless there's some twist."
None,Yakube44,"Its not really a talk no jutsu, zeke wasn't a fan of the rumbling in the first place and decided to go with the alliances side"
None,chaderenabs,"You expected it not to happen? You expected a full rumbling? It was already forshadowed with eren himself a few times? He already failed a few times so it's not expected? We always had victory in last one minute of shows (corps losing hope/everything goes according to common enemies way, then they somehow win), his talk no jutsu wasn't about friendship but meaning of life. You ppl are just making cringe excuses at this point"
Charlie-77,Abused_Avocado,Kitz was portrayed as a coward. It worked with Pixis who decided to step in and save them.
Charlie-77,Eyeofgaga,He’s the Walmart version of Naruto then
Charlie-77,edller,Well if it didn't work on Eren let's go to the onee~chan instead & probably give him a leaf or something that will work.
Charlie-77,None,It worked to bring the dead back to life.
Charlie-77,fcktupbitch,His Talk No Jutsu technique is effective at distraction though lol
Charlie-77,None,That first tnj didn't work on kitz but it did work on pixis which is even better
Charlie-77,EldianTitanShifter,"Well, he can still be Naruto, just the failed version, lol"
Charlie-77,None,"Goes to show that this series has shown us many times how realistic it is and how bs talk no jutsu is, and that tnj doesn't really ever work realistically. But then we have ch 137..... completely flips the 'realistic' theme of the story on its head and when armong couldn't even do tnj to save his two friends, now he does tnj to save the world. I really hope ch 137 is just a bait chapter by isayama

Edit: so far, I haven't gotten a single response to this comment giving me a valid counter arguement and refuting my claims, just downvotes by sheep minded people who don't agree with me but also can't come up with a way to argue with me, and somewhere deep down know that I'm right, so they downvote me out of their insecurity lmao"
None,Charlie-77,"But what is the TnJ in ch.137?

If you talk about Zeke he wasn't ""*TnJed*"" he died reafirming that the euthanasia plan was the right choice and he died aware about all his crimes..."
None,Alp_ha,"How did zeke get talk no jutsued? He never wanted the genocide, he's already on their side"

Soul_theorist,Omiboy20,"I mean plot armor is very necessary for a story to continue, a lot of characters have gotten plot armor on the series, let’s take in Eren as an example:
- Welp it’s good that the Santa titan didnt chew him, right?
- Well that was a very handy HARDEN bottle of “fluid”? That was just lying there when he needed it.
- It’s also good that both times the Jaw titan tried to eat him he failed due to plot armor. Seriously, the Jaw can BITE THROUGH HARDENING but took long enough for Levi to save Eren. During the War for Paradis arc, he literally came out of the ceiling to eat Eren but only got his legs? (He might’ve jumped back but that quickly?
- Eren got his head SHOT OFF by a high-caliber rifle in a way that his head SHOULDNT have landed right on Zeke’s hand.

Plot armor is everywhere on the series! But it shouldn’t be necessarily bad! I love the characters and will wait for the last 2 chapters before judging the Armin decision (even though I don’t really think it was bad)"
Omiboy20,HustleDLaw,"Yeah people don’t seem to realize that every story ever needs “plot armor” for a story to continue lol. That term really needs to die, an author can give any character in his story plot armor if he thinks it benefits it. That’s why it’s a story & not real life."
HustleDLaw,AreYouThereSagan,"Seriously. People just pick and choose instances of ""plot armor"" they don't like (usually because they don't like the character) and ignore all the other ones. Virtually every work of fiction requires plot armor, because otherwise you have the make the characters invincible, which is boring."

Omiboy20,_SAM-P,"I don't understand why people keep bringing up the Santa Clause titan as an example of plot armour, eren was already inside the mouth with his hand sticking out. The titan chomped and his arm fell off and he just dropped inside the mouth. How would it chew him exactly, usually titans grab their victims to bit into their head or back, that wasn't the case with Eren how is that plot armour?"

jonathanosv,uselessjunkie64,I feel for Falco man. I know Eren thought he was a good guy at heart but in the end he was just a pawn for Eren just as he was for Marley. He quite literally is the purest character in the anime. I’m glad he gets more confident and more screen time towards the end.

Ridhxni,OraDude,Thanks. I forgot which scene this was
Ridhxni,jakethedumbmistake,I know I'm not a quitter.

bikpizza,Professional-Leg4721,"this is from the lost girls ova

Ridhxni,Indominus_Khanum,This from the lost girls ova Mikasa episode right. That shit is eerily similar to 138
Ridhxni,aVeryEdgyUsername,Joke explained: Farmer-kun inherits the Attack Titan
Ridhxni,Engascan,I don't care what happens at chapter 139. Titanfolk is EH safeplace and is going to stay like that until the end of time.
Ridhxni,Ankhsu-Amon,Wait this story was about a bird ... I do know a giant bird ... does it mean that Falco impregnated Historia. He must have received the order through the path and the Founder/Eren 🤔 oh no !! 😱 Falco is the father !! 🤪🥱😪
Ridhxni,ethxn66,It’s his memories 😳
Ridhxni,None,"She looked so happy first, its my cock!, then she hears historias name and be like YANDERE MODE ON"
Ridhxni,MaxVonBritannia,Wait.....since when does the ***farmer*** inherit the attack titan. Guess he was a real chad after all.
MaxVonBritannia,XlKPandaXlK,He always has been. He gets to bang the queen and doesn't even need to fight lol.
XlKPandaXlK,Independent-Move-629,Eren gets to bang and impregnate the queen
Ridhxni,bikpizza,is this the new episode?
bikpizza,None,that episode is from the lost girls OVA based on mikasa. give it a watch
Ridhxni,strawberryyy98,Fake?

Ridhxni,BioLizard18,"Damn, farmer-kun sent those memories to Eren just to NTR him from the future???

Talk about a power move!"
BioLizard18,None,"Farmer-kun is actually Eren. Isayama is gonna end the entire father debate by showing us the Chapter 107 scene and then a panel showing that the Farmer has Eren’s face.

Therefore Eremika fans who say it’s the farmer and Erehisu fans who say it’s eren will both be correct and satisfied"

Donnie619,KingoftheWalls,It's a joke
KingoftheWalls,Donnie619,"No shit. I just think these memes are getting so out of hand, they forget when he actually finds out he can see the future."
Donnie619,XlKPandaXlK,This is obviously fake.
Ridhxni,siebenundsiebzigelf,"friendly reminder that Eren didn't have his Titan back then, so sadly makes less sense than i thought (it's still funny af)"
siebenundsiebzigelf,StormyIce,Eren did get his initial dream before he had his titan though.
StormyIce,siebenundsiebzigelf,"you're right, i have not thought about that. I wonder how that would work out. Maybe we will get an explanation in 139 ;)"
Ridhxni,lefondler,"This joke is lost on me, can someone explain?"
Ridhxni,MelonLordxx,This is heartbreaking but also so funny
Ridhxni,ClonedToKill420,Simpler times
Ridhxni,ravatos626,How did eren obtain my memories?

WishyRater,woancue,"this lol, tiktok is actually really fun once the algorithm gets your tastes right. it has the reputation of it just being girls dancing (which is def there) but the algorithm learns quick and if you dont like that it wont show you it"
WishyRater,baby-lotus,There r probably good stuff there but the only aot ones ive scene either just dont slap or its just some attractive person doing some peculiar pose for 10 whole seconds before presenting some basic level aot knowledge. Lmao. Im probably just too used to titanfolk

axerex,ArunMinElTri,"The bird memes are wild on Twitter, isayama might as well make it canon since eren is now literally the exact opposite of what he said his ideal character was"
ArunMinElTri,AbanoMex,i wonder if he sees the memes.
AbanoMex,braujo,"Probably. He's pretty young, so I really doubt he doesn't have a secret Twitter or whatever."
AbanoMex,360chaos,"I'm sure he's lurking on this very subreddit, he literally did the 'ellen becomes dove(crying)' Ending"
ArunMinElTri,Soul699,He's a bird. He's free to fly.
ArunMinElTri,Supernova-581,"How is he the opposite though? Sure he vented to Armin, but he still sacrificed all that he wanted for the plan, went on with it and told Mikasa to forget about him. and his “who knows” was probably just because of what he was going through, but he definitely had a plan that he went with till the end."
Supernova-581,ArunMinElTri,Because  eren literally became a plot device for other characters to shine and he lied about his motives with and goals despite there not being any foreshadowing for it this is something Isayama said he hated
ArunMinElTri,Dontaskmemyname9723,"Can you tell
Me what to type to find them?"
Dontaskmemyname9723,ArunMinElTri,Just type jean mikasa and go to the top tweets they're all over

axerex,felix_717,>implying mikasa moved on when after 3 years she still at his grave loool
felix_717,DragonSeniorita_009,"Has anyone on this sub ever lost a loved one? You go visit their graves on special occasions, leave flowers, talk to them for a while. Then keep on living."
felix_717,None,"It's his death anniversary, she can visit his grae every once in a while."
None,Ness_64,"You know, I found the ending okay, but I'm here to comment on this specific part of it. This was one of my disappointments with it: This is the *only* thing we see of Mikasa after the time skip. She's also the only one in the group who didn't dress formally in the ending, which implies she isn't visiting Paradis, she decided to live there (presumably so she could visit Eren's grave anytime she wanted).

We really can't blame people for thinking Mikasa didn't really move on from Eren when the only thing we have as evidence to the contrary is the fact she was the one to kill him. If it was shown that, for example, she moved to Hizuru to start a new life there, *but* was visiting Eren's grave on this occasion anyway, it would have been fine. This could even imply that the peace talks worked to some extent, since the visit would have to happen afterwards.

I was okay with the ending (and even then, I feel the last scene is probably gonna be more emotional in the anime ~~if the copium-overdosed people don't end up right and we get an anime-original ending, anyway~~), but I still had disappointments and this was one of them"
felix_717,straywolfo,Yeah I want Mikasa to move on but JeanKasa is a nope for me. And Fingerstein seems epic.
straywolfo,ArunMinElTri,Well jean's got other plans

His first thought would be “yes I was really right!”, and his second thought would be “fuck I’m gonna have to kill a lot more people”.

HarambeKnewAbout911,Nada72kt,"I feel like Erwin too would've been very disappointed to see his dad's suspicions about there being people outside turn out true. Uncovering the truth is what he's always yearned for, but it's a terrible thing to have kept from you, especially since beyond the walls are people who view paradis as devils. It's just like a huge slap in the face to learn that after all of the scout's big talk about finding out more and winning for humanity, no matter how many comrades have to die in the process, it turns all to have been rather meaningless because humanity was already prosperous outside while the paradisians are this small minority the rest of the world would be better off without (except the azumabito lol ig since they wanted to capitalise on paradis's resources).

However he's not like Eren, we can't say for sure whether he would want a global genocide to happen or not so I really would be happy if Iyasama could one day have an interview where he tells us more about how specific characters would've behaved had they survived bc so far all we can do is speculate and theorise just like what I did above."
HarambeKnewAbout911,None,">implied that Erwin would lose his fire after finding out

Why? If anything he'd probably gain new motivation to do things. That was part of end of his character arc in canon as he put aside his dream to see the outside world, to sacrifice himself so that humanity within the walls would be saved.

Now that he knows what sort of threat he faces, he'd probably be a desire to defend the people of the island."
HarambeKnewAbout911,Potatolantern,"Yeah, just like how Armin's fire died out when he saw the sea and how Eren's died out when they killed all the Titans."
HarambeKnewAbout911,Soul_Ripper,"I doubt so. His base questions (titans and walls) had already been answered, but he wanted more, he wanted the follow up answers to the follow up questions. And if there's anything the basement revealed did is give us follow up questions.

Though one more tangible thing we have to work with is what Levi said, about letting him rest. So if nothing else that at least tells us Erwin was dealing with some suffering, things were taking a toll on him, and that probably would've only gotten exponentially worse, to unknown effects."

LoliMaster069,PakyKun,Or a route in which Santa titan chewed. Since Adult Eren wouldn't convince Grisha to kill frieda (due to him dying in this time-line) i wonder what would have happened. Maybe the royalty would have eventually activated the rumbling.

cavsalmostgotswept,None,">He would do the same thing, opposed Eren when rumbling inevitably happens, but will probably whoop Daz and Samuel's asses in the port lol

Erwin surviving changes so many things and massively influences the circumstances that made Eren choose the rumbling. Eren was reluctant to choose the rumbling as an option, but saw it as the only real option as the government didn't really have a viable plan for peace. 

Erwin would probably be more proactive in terms of actually creating a viable strategy for peace rather than sitting passively relying on the false charity of the Hizuru and Zeke while the rest of the world rallied to destroy the island."

Also it would be hard as hell for the Yeagerists & Zeke to outmaneuver a peak Erwin with Colossal Titan abilities. Maybe they’d kill him instead of trying to outsmart him idk? It would’ve made for an interesting narrative to say the least."
Gabzy12,Psychic_Reigen,Who told you that Erwin would be against the Yeagerists if he was alive?
DenkiAizen,nishmt,He was too hot and smart
DenkiAizen,LaddRusso55,Erwin in that gear on Liberio streets during the raid...they wouldn’t be ready for levels of SUSUME that we’ve seen

DenkiAizen,None,"It was also more thematic for Erwin to die instead of Armin. I remember Floch and Levi saying that he 'became the devil' or something along those lines. I strongly believe Erwin would've supported the rumbling if he thought using Historia wasn't viable (unlike Eren, I believe he would go with it if it was viable). It makes more sense plot-wise if someone like Armin is there so he can stop Eren, which, presumably, would lead to a better future. Now, whether that was executed well is another discussion."
DenkiAizen,None,"He had to let him die because it was his time to go, he was tired and it was hurting him. Wish more people considered this about his character before talking about Erwin what ifs"

None,Consistent_Worry_407,Yeah but that’ll eventually effect paradis in the long run. The outside world is advanced and is getting more advanced by the day. They’ll soon develop in nuclear warfare and it’ll put paradis in a load of trouble eventually. That’s part of the reason why Eren is doing what he’s doing.
None,Freaks-Cacao,"Erwin would have overthrow ed Yelena and taken the lead of the anti-marleyans, and he would definitely have had spies in Marley a lot earlier. I'm also sure he would have quickly found a way to use Hizuru more efficiently and make use of Paradis' ressources in gaz. Also, make use of the incredible destructive force that the colossal titan is.

Also, the 50 years plan was stupid, he would certainly not have done that."

I wouldnt say all, but Levi did admit that in the end, he was the one who made the decision. I said not all his fault because Eren was being a persistent butch, which influenced Levi's and Hange's decision

Armin was chosen because he was part of the three, Eren put his friends (later the group that included Jean, Stupid 1 and Stupid 2) above the Eldians/Humanity(at the time they didn't know about the Eldians story)"

None,R0MA2099,Yeah Erwin would have definitely nuked Marley completely instead of just the coast
Megren7,francorocco,i still think saving Armin was the wrong choice
francorocco,drago2000plus,"There is no wrong choice. Both Armin and Erwin were essential. That' s the problem. No matter what, humanity would have lost something irrepleceable that day."
drago2000plus,None,"I think the problem is that Armin, like Hange, isn’t cut out to be a leader, so to speak. He’s a great tactician and insanely observant, but he’s not charismatic like Erwin, and both Armin and Hange lack his talent for deception and politics.

Erwin was a more well-rounded leader, and I’m not sure what other scout could’ve helped fill that gap. Levi or Jean?"
drago2000plus,None,">There is no wrong choice. Both Armin and Erwin were essential. That' s the problem. No matter what, humanity would have lost something irrepleceable that day.

Erwin had decades of experience as a military leader where Armin was an inexperienced 15 year old. Erwin had experience and connections in terms of politics which would probably give him insight on how how to properly manage the situation after the truth of the outside world is revealed.

The decision to save Armin was an emotional rather than a logical/tactical one. Its even acknowledged as such by the other characters."
drago2000plus,Mango_120,based
drago2000plus,Soul_Ripper,"Losses can still be quantified and qualified. There is a ""better choice"", but only Yams has the full picture, we can only speculate and egotistically pretend like our opinions on what would've happened are objectively correct or some shit."
francorocco,EVG2666,"FACTS

While Armin was a good strategist, so was Erwin. In fact Ewrin was better. Erwin was a true leader. He was always calm and composed in every situation. Armin has a mental breakdown in almost every fight. Erwin deserved to see the secrets in the basement."
EVG2666,princessvaginaalpha,"I agree. Erwin is a better strategist, experienced, and politically apt. Afte the time-skip Armin was still ""just-Armin"". He didn't grow leaps, something the Eldians could have usedafter the timeskip

He probably would have a better handle of Eren too. Hange couldn't handle Eren the emoboy, Armin made emoboy worse, and Mikasa just goes along with everything Eren does. 

Erwin would have solved all these problems - Eren respects Erwin, wouldn't treat him the same way he treated Armin.

Armin, wrong choice"
EVG2666,None,"I think Armin is strictly the better tactician. He’s insanely observant - figuring out Annie’s identity(and later Reiner), figuring out the only way to defeat the Colossal, etc. Both him and Hange lack Erwin’s talent for deception and politics tho, which comes back to bite the Scouts during the post timeskip events with the Yeagerists vs the Government/MPs/Garrison."
EVG2666,Killcode2,"Armin devised a plan in liberia that led to only 8 people dying, erwin's plans lead to every scout except main characters dying."
EVG2666,LazloFF,"But he wasn't human enough, he was tired of all this shit. He'd most likely never continue after what he found out."
francorocco,kodaandorion,"No, I have to disagree, saving Erwin would have not been what he wants. Erwin had given up on his dream (proving that his father was right) so he could die heroically with the recruits, forcing him to come back would’ve been for nothing for Erwin, and even if he reignited his dream he probably would have been disappointed at the results the same way Eren was.

Armin died FOR his dream. He died so Eren could go see the ocean for him. When he came back, his dream was not dead."
kodaandorion,EVG2666,So did Armin when he sacrificed himself. They didn't want to let go of their dreams but did so to ensure the missions succeeded.
kodaandorion,Groose-Legacy,"I do not think Erwin would have been disappointed by the revelation in the basement at all. The important thing for him would’ve been that he was right, his father was right and the king DID steal the memories of his people 100 years ago. The fact that Eldia is hated and feared by everyone outside the walls would have been less important to Erwin in the moment that he learned the truth. Furthermore the argument that “he gave up on his dream before he did the cavalry charge so it’s fine that he died! Armin dying would have been much sadder.” Like no. That’s not how dreams work, neither Armin nor Erwin gave up on their dreams, they instead decided that there was something more important than their dreams, the continued survival of those they care about and victory. Erwin and Armin both sacrificed themselves, but Erwin never gave up, his final thoughts weren’t “no Levi don’t inject me with the serum and save my life” his final thoughts were “but dad, how do we know that everyone outside the walls is dead?”"
kodaandorion,None,"About Erwin not having motivation if he comes back:

Even though there's references to Erwin wanting to abandon his dream (I think that's a good place to leave him off), what's to say he won't just continue with a different dream entirely?

I think it's reliant on what a lot of people bash the alliance for: Hange had a duty to protect paradis. If she personally wants to save other lives, she can go right ahead, but not at the expense of her duty to paradis. But because she loves the outside world, she's forced to make the decision to support paradis over the world. It's not what she wanted, but it is most definitely betrayal as they were working under the assumption that paradis would be eradicated.

Would Erwin have been indecisive in this way? For someone like Erwin, quitting the SC and not helping paradis is also similar to betrayal. He would've greatly improved their chances and leaving clearly puts them in a terrible spot. So it really comes down to: would Erwin have continued due to his duty? Or would he have let his lack of a dream abandon his duty? Maybe he would've even found a new motivation in that duty: he has lines about continuing the war against the enemy after the basement is found."
kodaandorion,UrethraPlethora,"But armin saw the ocean already, yet he still fights. You think Erwin wouldn’t do the same?"
francorocco,None,"From a non-emotional perspective, yes. But keeping Erwin in his position especially with the destructive powers of the colossal, wouldn’t be fair to him"
francorocco,Eagleassassin3,Erwin was the better choice. But Armin isn’t a bad choice either.
Eagleassassin3,francorocco,after reading the ending i still hold my position
Megren7,None,"Erwin vs. Eren would have severely weakened the Yeagerists, he'd definitely have his own faction and it would reverberate into lengthening the story in order to deal with all the loose ends he would cause with his actions.

In retrospect, even though I thought it was logically senseless to revive Armin instead of him it makes sense in order to properly frame the story."
None,None,">Erwin vs. Eren would have severely weakened the Yeagerists, he'd definitely have his own faction and it would reverberate into lengthening the story in order to deal with all the loose ends he would cause with his actions.

There likely would have never been a split in the first place as Eren and Floch both respected Erwin and deferred to his authority. Though there would likely be some distance between Erwin and Eren over Armin's death, but like with Floch their common goals would probably bring them together as close allies."
None,NenBE4ST,Eren would have went down his path due to receiving memories of the future anywaya
None,None,"You realize that Floch is the one who carried half-dead Erwin back and insisted that Erwin should've been saved? 

Floch and Eren revolted because their leaders were too passive during the 4 years, as if they were waiting for Marley to come and bomb the shit out of them. That wouldn't have been the case with Erwin alive."
Megren7,Phantasia5,"Armin hasn't managed to do anything that Erwin would not be able to, even Armin himself acknowledged that. He was not the correct choice. He wasted 4 years simping on a girl in a crystalline cocoon. The only reason Armin was saved is because he is important for the plot, for the talk with Zeke in Paths. 

Erwin would've used the Rumbling as leverage for aggressive diplomacy against outer nations to let Paradis thrive.

Phantasia5,basedcringemmeta,"Pretty good read, imo this was the most shonen moment in the series for me. I was hoping for it to subvert expectations and pick Erwin, that's not what happened. Though it's pretty strange that the blog author claims that this one moment ruined the series, dropping it from perfection to 8/10 when he lists Death Note as a masterpiece when the entire final arc was lackluster."
basedcringemmeta,LazloFF,"Yeah, especially because he says that a wrong decision from a character ruins a story. Levi wanted Armin to live longer, and that's why he never regret saving him instead of Erwin, which realistically had no real reason to live other than finding the secret, a dream that he gave up in.
That's like saying that Eren is a bad character because he wanted to kill all the titans, yet ended up saving them. It's a really dumb way to look at a piece of work."
Phantasia5,Supermarrrr,"You are sleeping on Armin. Sure Erwin could of done anything Armin did, but Armin was much faster at solving the problems. Armin found out who the female Titan was. Armin came up with both ideas on plugging the holes, the Boulder and the hardening ability. Armin found out Reiner was inside the walls. Armin figured out how to beat the colossal Titan with a battered Eren... I’m not trying to take away from what Erwin has done, but don’t sleep on Armin that hard."
Phantasia5,None,"The main reason Armin was saved is because it was Erwin’s time to rest, from an emotional perspective"

They should have both died heroically on the battlefield, this way the story wouldn't have those errors and we would've avoided all the fucking drama that this scene makes (Who would have been the better option?)

BeticoAguerrido,None,"Erwin gets a glancing blow from a smaller fragment. We do see larger fragments dismembering other scouts or otherwise destroying them(Marlow’s head) and their horses. It’s not out of possibility. Floch survives because he was hanging off to the side and his horse took the full hit.

Armin surviving the fall is crazier."
None,BeticoAguerrido,"The thing is, a 50cal bullet is very small, yet if you get hit by it, you can say goodbye to the limb it impacted, imagine what it does to you if you get hit on your torso.

The rock was bigger than a 50cal bullet and was travelling quite quick so I think that it would've done greater damage to him than he got, although we don't know how much, maybe the anime exaggerated it or something.

That or maybe it hit the floor first, bounced and then hit Erwin. That's the only way I think Erwin could have survived for minutes after getting hit"
Megren7,fds2034,He gonna flirt with annie
Megren7,No-Seaweed-4456,I’ve seen this before
Megren7,DasUngeheuer,I love how at first glance it looks like his arm is still cut off.
Megren7,False_Duck,Levi looks pretty tall here 👀
Megren7,ProNut101,Let the arguments for if erwin or armin should have gotten the syringe begin once again!
Megren7,cobaltScalebane,An alternate reality where the Colossal is shorter than a 2 story house.
cobaltScalebane,None,I wonder what would’ve happened if Pieck saved Bertholdt instead of Reiner?  Armored Armin/Erwin? The story would’ve been worse because Reiner has been such a well-written character since the reveal/after timeskip.
Megren7,ThaRealPhoenix,"Where it’s at now with Armin fighting off Eren, it’s about as good as can be. Those moments aren’t remotely the same with Erwin. However, if Erwin had came back then it would be an entirely different situation. I don’t think anything that is happening now would happen. 

Erwin’s brain would caused a totally different situation. Though, I like where it’s at now because it feels more natural."
Megren7,-Encrypt,Armin looks like a chad
Megren7,aws5923,*sigh* fanfiction time

Megren7,pleasedonthitmedad69,*the good ending
Megren7,jakethedumbmistake,"Ikr. I'm really cheap but also I want a new cover for the whole test? Lawyering is easier than over-occupancy. Still not really a difficult thing to be born healthy and wanted, but reality gets in the way this headline was written, I was actually Napoleon Dynamite for all of the unnecessary CGI. I'm good for it, it isn’t doing that shit without equipment and it’ll show up in something like the Big Bang Theory, but the message is still clear"
Megren7,ZippZappZippty,"Sure, it's an Austrian thing right"
Megren7,Razerx7,"I’m not convinced Eren would have ever been able to accept Armin’s death at serumbowl. He just barely he’d it together when he assumed he was a burnt cookie, but the sheer desperation that kicked in afterwards."
Megren7,itsalwaysblue59,As cool as an Erwin and eren team up would be I don’t see it happening.
Megren7,RepresentativeEye960,"Erwin would sacrifice Historia for a corn chip, and I love it."
Megren7,FxPeter,You’re as beautiful as the day I lost you
Megren7,Jzon_P,"This shit sounds weird but, If Erwin got the colossal titan do you think he would've fallen in love with Annie?"
Jzon_P,SuperNerd6527,No
SuperNerd6527,Jzon_P,oh ok ty mate

Megren7,Spare-Naive,Wow they look so cool
Megren7,Death_Usagi,One thing I can tell for sure is that Eren may have gone dark much earlier in comparison to original if Erwin was chosen. No idea about Mikasa but we all know she'd try to follow.
Megren7,None,I don't understand why nobody shat on Levi for his decision
Megren7,None,My dearest commander...

My canon is that the Madagascar ending occured. 

Eren wiped out humanity, mind wiped everyone alive and used the Founder to turn them all into animals.

Eren is King Julian"

marskumu,wuh-mmgh-huh,"How on earth did she manage to cross the ocean and enter Paradis (where she’d be considered an enemy) all by herself? Even Kiyomi’s kindness can’t cover all that. 

Plus she’s carrying Eren’s head this entire time?? He would start decomposing before she even reached Shiganshina"
wuh-mmgh-huh,marskumu,"You are underestimating Kiyomi's kindness. Besides, Yelena the secret 10th whale titan was with them. She always swam forward even after the titan curse is gone. So it was all thanks to kiyomi who managed to convince Yelena to shift one more time so they could cross the ocean easily. And then Eren's head became a dove and guided them to the paradis then became a head again."
marskumu,None,[deleted]
marskumu,wuh-mmgh-huh,Ah yes of course. Thanks for clarifying! I’m truly sorry for underestimating Kiyomi’s kindness

wuh-mmgh-huh,punctualjohn,"Woooow this is actually getting embarassing, damn... even something so simple couldn't be made to be logical. I guess she sped all the way back to the boat so she would be there first, then hid the head, headed back with other people, and then all whilst carrying the head, she sneaked past everyone at the harbor and made it all the way back to the tree?! The harbor got wiped, but surely by then there were new folks that would have showed up to clean up the mess there and would have given the boat a very warm (not) welcome. Wouldn't put it past mikasa to manage all of that, but still that's a lotta fucking assumptions to be making.

gueeruhj,shibboleth2005,"This is actually my headcanon. If not the plane then a zeppelin or something. Basically she dramatically walks off into the smoke for a few minutes, stops and thinks about it, then awkwardly turns around back to the mesa to find Onyonkapon lol."

marskumu,ProfessionalCornToss,That head was probably decomposed by the time she got there.

SolracXD,Icy_Ad8122,Forget Code Geass. AOT literally got the School Days ending in terms of randomness. The difference is that the latter was kind of mid all the way through and then butchers the characters in the end.

marskumu,TheSurveyCorpses,Mikasa: If I keep walking the grief can't catch up with me.

Then again it's Mikasa so they probably are giving her a wide berth"

Remember Mike from S1 and S2 E1? The one who got brutally murdered by Zook? Then Zook took his 3DMG and gave it to Kiyomi so she could fuel her kindness with Icumeburst stone. But here comes the brilliant part, Mike San, sounds a lot like Mikasa.

Coincidence?

Absolutely not! Because how did Mikasa get back into Paradis? 3DMG!


Isayam you madlad, did it once again! Foreshadowed 139 from as early as S2 😳"
Abh1laShinigami,marskumu,Based analysis.
marskumu,bloodlmt,How does Mikasa returns to Shiganshina to give proper burial to Ellen? She needs to board a ship or fly a plane right?
bloodlmt,pootis64,Only Ymir knows.
marskumu,None,I was wondering this too. Did she really walk from Marley to Paradis on foot? Or did she just just board a plane/ship after the battle by somewhere with Eren's head so nobody especially Marleyan soldiers and Eldian civilians can found her?
marskumu,No-Seaweed-4456,Seriously tho. How did they get back?!
No-Seaweed-4456,None,[deleted]
None,No-Seaweed-4456,"Yeah but how did they get to said boat? Ends of train tracks destroyed, no shifters, no airships. They’d die before getting back to civilization, unless the escape trains had like unlimited quantities of food and water."
marskumu,None,This is giving me heavy kaneki vibes.

marskumu,YesterdaySuper5355,"When I realized this, as I was reading the chapter, all that went through my head was “you’re wierd. You’re really fucking wierd.”"
marskumu,None,She keeps moving forward until the head can be buried
marskumu,Pot_Loving_Chef,I actually laughed out loud when Mikasas said she would just walk back home
Pot_Loving_Chef,NaviFili,"I laughed out loud when Armin, freaking Armin thanked Eren for massacring 80% of humanity, so wholesome of him to become the devil for their sake!"
NaviFili,Pot_Loving_Chef,I understand what armin was trying to say but my god was some of the dialogue really bad.
marskumu,WokePlatypus,I assumed she buried the head or packed it away then rejoined the group. Then snuck off to Paradis more leisurely.
WokePlatypus,None,"She sneaked away to hide his head on a bag. 

That's at least what i believe."
None,punctualjohn,"That shit is gonna reek within a day, no one is coming within 3 meters of that bag without dry heaving from the stench. Just a few  days and it'd be so rotted her fingers would push into the bag like an old avocado when she goes to pick it up."
marskumu,yellowvanranoveraman,The memes and leaks thread made this chapter less disastrous 🤣🤣
marskumu,GodlyLobster,"She used one of the collosal titan's body as a ship, then used her Ackerman strength to propel her forward. How did she prevent Eren's head from rotting you ask? She put his head in her vagina and gave birth to Eren when she reached paradise for the burial. I can't believe you guys couldn't figure that out, it was clearly implied through the story smh."
GodlyLobster,None,"> She put his head in her vagina and gave birth to Eren when she reached paradise for the burial.

Maybe getting blown up by a Thunder Spear isn't such a bad fate after all."

marskumu,toptierAlpacaScout,"Omg, i was thinking of the same thing... Like how is she gonna go back to paradis by foot... Did she eat eren's head on her journey??? Cuz it will surely take her days if not weeks to go back, she will definitely starve..."

Cipheros06,marskumu,You are welcome my friend
marskumu,AbhilashBaruah,Lol the ending is bad in so many ways....and some people are laughing on us who claim it as a bad ending
AbhilashBaruah,bloodlmt,"Mikasa doesnt even have gps to know which direction is the way back to Paradis. 

My current headcannon is some yeagerist offer her trip to back home using boat in exchange for some informations. Probably will be covered in OVA in future releases."
bloodlmt,AbhilashBaruah,Still taking a decapitated head like some grocery from one place to another....Is kind of wild and hard to digest
AbhilashBaruah,mrBreadBird,There was definitely some bad/corny shit in there in the spirit of wrapping things up in one chapter. I like the ending but it's hard to deny.
marskumu,Marmot288,"imagine someone doing a bag search on her, boom there’s erens head, although who would stop a determined mikasa on her path?"
marskumu,shm0p,I never joined this subreddit. I am not in it. Yet still I see this post when I am casually looking through reddit and get spoiled massively...   .\_.

marskumu,shm0p,"Yeah well it happens, can't do anything about it now. I am just sad cuz this anime is in my top 3 and I was really excited to watch it without reading the manga or spoiling myself in anyway. Guess I need to be more careful"

marskumu,wendigo72,I will riot if the anime doesn’t give us a Tokyo Ghoul Root A style episode where Mikasa slow walks for 30 minutes while sad music plays

marskumu,ToapFN,Add spoiler to this post for people that haven’t read chapter 139
marskumu,DrFabulous0,I imagine she rejoined her comrades for the journey home. I doubt they had readily available transport at that point so the journey itself would have been long and hard.
DrFabulous0,kurlyhairedboi,I don't think she did because it took the rest of the alliance 3 years to get back to Shiganshina
kurlyhairedboi,NenBE4ST,"I dont think so lol, they were exiled and spent their time probably helping rebuild Marley or some other country. The timeskip showed them on their way back home as protected embassadors, protected by historia"

marskumu,Nohan97,"She leaving is really funny but It was just for dramatic effect, my headcannon is that she rejoined the group some some time later after armin calmed the things down and then she took a boat with refugees or something.

Skinn3y_Tortilla,YisusElPapuh,That Pepe punch image is based on a dragon ball scene where Vegeta punches into the screen perspective doing that exact pose. I'm sure Eren's pose is also based on that. All three images are identical.

Stoner420Eren,Nerdcuddles,"""Eren just wanted to protect his country""   


He just wanted to watch the world burn, but even in the ""protecting his country"" scenario, intentionally causing a mass extinction event after destroying his own country and making it a shell of its former self is NOT protecting it.   


The Jeagerists changed Paradi for the worse, objectively. They where basically terrorists with stolen nukes aimed at every single country, ignoring the nuclear winter that'd come after.   


Zeke and Eren where the two most untrustworthy people alive, and they made an ideology out of them."

ChloeWyvern,Stoner420Eren,Yeah but you gotta understand that Eren had no choice but to do the rumbling he wanted to save his people. Armin is a back-stabbing traitor also he nuked an entire military port

Nerdcuddles,Lucky_Roberts,"No, Armin is in the deepest pit of hell with the betrayers. Eren is in the 7th circle, reserved for those who commit violence against their fellow man."
Lucky_Roberts,Nerdcuddles,"Eren betrayed him tf you mean? Eren would be in the deepest layer for conspiring with Zeke to use his founding titan to commit genocide in the first place, than somehow being worse and betraying him to commit omnicide."
Lucky_Roberts,Naive_Age_3910,I didn’t think armin was that bad ? 😂 what the marlayns are innocent and armin just shouldn’t have become a colossal Titan to help his country?
Nerdcuddles,Annihilator4413,"Could be heaven for Mikasa, being reunited with the one she loved. Eren definitely goes to hell, his genocide only led to more violence and death. Extremely dumb move."

Nerdcuddles,blackstar_4801,Likely go to heaven for saving allot of people from Nazi Germany lead world alliance
blackstar_4801,Nerdcuddles,"Imagine if Oppenheimer lead a mass production of nukes at the end of WW2 and than carpet bombed every single country except the US with nuclear bombs, that would be a real life equivalent to what eren did. 

Killing everyone only causes peace because everyone is to dead to fight, that's not a GOOD thing. You killed every potential and existing ally in the crossfire because you where thinking in absolute black and white, either ""kill everyone that breathes or be killed"" which is utterly ridiculous. 

Literally everyone else on the island (except floch, because he's an imbecile) was working for a better solution, then Eren intentionally separated himself and the plot began. 

If anymore thought was put into the rumbling as well, it'd cause a massive storm that'd just wipe out paradi anyways and send humanity extinct along with most animals on land, it'd just be another Permian Mass Extinction event except instead of volcanism the world is being flattened and boiled by walking nukes."

Stoner420Eren,_b3rtooo_,"I imagine the people that say this say it because they understand the sentiment, not that they support it. It's immensely different. 

I can understand one's circumstances and the thinking that brought them to this point, without liking or agreeing with their actions. It's called empathy. 

Eren showed remorse, regret, and a certain amount of reluctance from once he saw the future to when he was living it. Regardless of those inhibitions though, he still acted out on it because after considering the situation, the only way still to protect his loved ones and his home was to sacrifice the other 80% of the world. 

It's impossible to make a clearly defined black&white yes/no on whether that was the right decision or not given the circumstances. If he didn't act, his world that he loved and cared for would have been annihilated. Is it moral to let your loved ones and their loved ones die when you had the power to prevent it? If he did act, an unfathomable amount (idk what the population of that world was, but even using ours of ~8billion, that's just too big a number for my brain, and probably most people's, to actually conceptualize)  of lives would have been lost. It was a lose/lose situation, so he chose the option that would have benefited his own people. 

In real life we see militants and rebels and freedom fighters of varied backgrounds and ideologies carrying out attacks on their oppressors. To the oppressors, that's terrorism, to the oppressed, it's self-defense. Israel vs Palestine, the American revolution, ""Manifest Destiny,"" the list goes on. Each side thinks the other side is the bad guy. 

TLDR; people ""supporting""/defending Eren (who aren't blinded by fandom) say so out of empathy for his impossibly difficult situation, not because they are genocidal maniacs. There is no simple right or wrong/ black and white answer."

Wild-Mushroom2404,Stoner420Eren,"So what you basically want to cut the last 20 chapters of the story? 

The 80% is the amount of people Eren killed before being stopped, if his friends didn't decide to make an alliance to stop him he would have gone fore 100%, it's not exactly a number Eren chose, he gave them free will and they were able to stop him at 80. Eren still wanted to do the rumbling, but he also couldn't bring himself to kill his friends, so he made the best possible compromise that also had the erasure of titan powers as an extra"
Stoner420Eren,Wild-Mushroom2404,"Well, it’s the number Isayama chose, and I don’t really understand the reasoning.

 were genuine literal 1939 German National Socialists and conquered most of the rest of the world and made them involved in fighting Paradis. The Paradis residents were actually peaceful for hundreds of years and still were being murdered brutally and subjugated.
If anything I would understand. Marley fanned the flames of a fire they didn’t start or provide the wood for in my eyes, but there is an argument for both being wrong."
Skeeter_Ing,Jazzlike_Stop_1362,"Paradise wasn't peaceful for hundreds of years, it was specifically one hundred, before that it was 1900 years of subjugation of the rest of the planet and even themselves, just wanted to point that out not necessarily make an argument for anything"

Stoner420Eren,cheecharon17,"Im mostly not on the “support genocide” side, but I understand in a sense that I’m okay with me dying if I were to support Eren’s ideology. I kinda hate the human race. A reset is probably a good idea. Being stomped on by a colossal is probably less painful than what the Marleyans have in store for me if they win."
cheecharon17,Stoner420Eren,This is an interesting perspective
cheecharon17,RedNUGGETLORD,"I mean, he is also killing all the animals and all the current plant life(it'll regrow in the volcanic like ash everywhere)"
RedNUGGETLORD,cheecharon17,"Yes. But the earth is earth. Even if it takes a zillion years it will undergo its cycle. If it doesn’t, so be it. It may be a bit too nihilistic, but this is exactly what Zeke’s talking about. What makes humans think they’re so special that they have to outlive everything else? Why do they have this constant need to reproduce? It’s no different from a cancer cell. Armin convinced him otherwise, but can’t you also “enjoy the little things” even if you go through with Zeke’s plan? I don’t know."
cheecharon17,Wild-Mushroom2404,"To be fair though, he chose a particular island to be a reset for humanity. Who said that they are superior or more worthy? Why won’t they fuck up the new human race?"
Wild-Mushroom2404,cheecharon17,"Well, it doesn’t matter. It still stands that both sides are horrible people. It just so happened that the Founding’s power was on the Eldian side. Just because they get to live doesn’t mean that they’re superior or more deserving. If you reverse it and have the Marleyans stomp out the Eldians, it’s the same. Eren probably spent the entire time thinking about this and just said fuck it, if everything eventually ends in shit then he’ll just do what he can for his happiness lol.

As for the “why won’t they fuck up the human race”, we don’t know if they will or they won’t. But what is known is that the current time is shit and there’s a higher chance of a better future in a reset than the current state.

Personally, I think Zeke’s plan was the “least” selfish."
cheecharon17,FreshPrinceOfIndia,"I've thought about this a lot. Eren wanted to wipe out humanity because freedom didn't lie on the other side of the sea, more suffering did. Not just towards his people, but countless instances of suffering against humanity across the world. If his pursuit was selfish, then isn't Armin and Hange's pursuit selfish too? 

In doing what they wanted for their idea of what is right, they successfully ensured a far higher death count than the 20% Eren stops at, only a hundred years later, which if we go by the anime, lasts hundreds and hundreds of years. 

Wasn't that selfish of them too?

I think if even *one* person suffers, thats too many. Somewhere out there, someone is being tortured, hurt, treated like a dog, robbed off their freedom despite being born into this world like any of us.

Eren wanted it all to go away and I can't blame him, the future of the world he would've brought would be full of an endless landscape free to wander, but I recognize that of course, humanity will keep fighting until there's one person left or less.

So I suppose I still don't know what's better, a world where suffering gets delayed a lot more, or a world that saw Eren being put down by his comrades despite having every reason not to, a world that resumed its old ways less than 200 years later anyway"
Stoner420Eren,Levisponge0,Well you know theres an 80% chance they would have died
Stoner420Eren,Mistovaa,"I support the rumbling not because it is good or right thing to do. Because it is one of the most expected move from someone like Eren. And if you start this you should go to the end like that so, your island wont perish."

Stoner420Eren,sarcastic-romantic,I don’t say Eren should have gone 100% because I want that to happen in real life. I say Eren should have gone 100% because I think it’s a more interesting and tonally consistent ending that is more true to his portrayal throughout the fictional story he resides in.

 This is why people sided with Eren,  we start the story with Paradisians being innocent/brainwashed and others wanting to wipe them out, not hard to understand   




Also no shit people wouldn't want to die, I'm pretty sure the Yeagerists make it clear the few of their own casualties are sacrifices that had to be made to ensure their survival, Armin the hypocrite defended Erwin's sacrifice methods, a guy who ended up putting civilians at risk, would I oppose not being caged inside an Island and learning the truth for that?"

Like-if you told an American prisoner to jump off the Eiffel Tower it wouldn’t work. As far as controlling behavior went, I think it mostly just was committing suicide that you could make someone do, because every person has the capacity for that by a shinigami’s point of view.

Take this with a grain of salt though-it’s been a minute since I read Death Note."

TheUsrTheUsr,Wene-12,She loved Eren but a good 90% of their lives were spent as children idk why these people have such a vendetta against someone moving on from a relationship that was portrayed as a tragedy
Wene-12,choclatewithnuts676,Idk why those degenerates think a women waiting 50+ years and not moving on is realistic 💀💀
choclatewithnuts676,bbbryce987,"I think the conflicting narratives being portrayed in the ending have a lot to do with it. On one hand, Mikasa “breaks free” of her obsession, killing Eren for the greater good of humanity, (implied to have) moved on and started a family. On the other, she is shown visiting his grave years after his death (understandable, it’s possible to do that while still moving on) and getting buried next to him while still wearing his scarf..? (that’s where it starts to get contradictory) 

And some people are just degenerate incels who don’t even care about anything I just wrote"
choclatewithnuts676,primal_nebula,50+ years?🤨🤨 What show were you watching?
choclatewithnuts676,Pretty_Print_8605,"Because Mikasa's entire character is around Eren, if you see. Yea of course she's the most badass character and cool as well (my favourite too) but her entire character was based around eren, so if she doesn't marry, that makes more sense than her marrying someone else. Also, who the hell would get married beside a guy they loved in their childhood rather than their husband? Mikasa did get buried beside Eren and If, even after all this, people think she has a husband or she moved on, then i must say, her husband must be a cuck to allow her grave to be made beside Eren."

TheUsrTheUsr,Jerry98x,"* The first AoT character created by Isayama
* Character design is based on a real life girl
* Enters AoT and becomes Isayama's signature
* Belongs to both Ackerman and Oriental clans, the two bloodlines that opposed the king's philosophy
* Her Ackerman clan is feared by the monarchy because the king can't control the Ackerman family
* Is referred as ""The girl worth a hundred soldiers"", ""Model cadet"" and ""A genius of historically unprecedented significance"" by her superiors
* Humanity's strongest female soldier; saves most of the AoT cast
* Is the personification of strength, love, pride, family, and home
* Uses her strength to protect the weak instead of becoming power drunk and feed on the weak
* Represents one of the main themesof AoT: ""Beauty in the cruel world""
* Is royalty, but refuses the offer of taking advantage of her rank to escape the war. Instead, fights for the cause she believes in
* Isn't a damsel in distress, can protect herself and others
* Doesn't join the Jaegerists (biggest cult dedicated to Eren) and refuses their offer to become their leader like a boss she is
* Is the centerpiece of AoT and the key to break the curse
* Becomes the epitome of selflessness, sacrificing her most important person
* Makes IRL Jaegerists cry for the rest of their lives, ""10 years at least""
* Lives a long and happy life, as Eren wanted for her
* Exposes the rotten within AoT fandom
* Leaves"
Jerry98x,CosmosFactor,"I like that mikasa started as an accessory to Eren. She was just there to appease him, she didn’t have her own opinions, just Eren. And then she became more while still holding that loyalty to him. She still loved him, but she didn’t love what he became.

But because she’s not a 100 percent simp and slave to Eren, she’s instantly a bad female character and is butchered.(apparently)

I can understand not liking a character because you don’t like them. I can understand not liking a character because they didn’t fit what you thought they should play in a story, but I don’t think her character was flawed in a way that like… ruins the anime. She’s as solid built character with subtle, yet distinct, character changes. I like mikasa."
TheUsrTheUsr,Goobsmoob,"Apparently what makes a bad female lead is who they give their virginity to?

Look, I think Mikasa could have had a lot more depth. Especially in the Clash of the Titans arc and the Uprising arc. Her arc predominantly lies in S1, a small moment in S2, and the latter half of S4. Would I call her the greatest female anime character? No. But I don’t think she’s a bad character by any means at all, and I like her and her arc quite a bit personally.

But to be so sex obsessed that a character eventually having kids after her 19 yo love interest dies that you immediately jump to calling it “cucking” and talk about her “giving her virginity” makes you look like an idiot. Saying “hey man, I think the ending didn’t hit its thesis home and relied on major plot moments that should have been developed more” or “man, Mikasa was not as developed as I wished” and then elaborating are takes that are just fine. 

Turning your post into a weirdly sex obsessed ramble isn’t respectable. Also I can name way worse female leads in an abundance of mediums."

3. The symbols of one and four roses she put by his grave all her life.
4. Her band wasn't removed in the manga. She did have her mark on during her death which means she didn't pass it to her children.
5. Mikasa's entire character was nothing but revolved around Eren. All her life she thought about Eren only so her marrying someone else actually doesn't make any sense cause she has no love for any other man.

3. It's only an assumption that Japanese flower language was even being used at all, and even if it was, that doesn't have to mean anything significant. Like, yeah, she loves him. So what? Is she not allowed to move on? 

4. She just might not have had any children, that happens.

5. *Another loud incorrect buzzer* yes but also no.

6. I have no point here, the Eren bird jokes are annoying as hell

7. Who even cares, at the end of the day it's a fictional anime girl. Is she the best anime girl to ever exist? Of course not, but I enjoy her, and her character arcs. A lot could have been done with AoT, a lot of the characters are bland and soulless at times, and yet the only one people hate on is Mikasa because she possibly moved on from Eren therefore she ""cucked"" him after death."

Madagascar003,None,...yet they all lead to an unavoidable loss
None,BomanSteel,"Yeah, at first I was thinking Mikasa fumbled the bag at that moment, but the idea that if she confessed,  they just abandon Armin and everyone and essentially force them to figure everything out without they’re 2 strongest weapons leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
BomanSteel,None,"Also cuz Eren stated that eventually he would have died while having left everyone they care about to also die, just leaving Mikasa all on her own."
None,O4urHaul,It was in one of the OVA’s that foreshadowed that Eren would die regardless
O4urHaul,SomeDudeYeah27,Which one would that be again?
Madagascar003,Affectionate-Wave6,"I think we all forget how little time Eren had left to spend with Mikasa because of the titan’s rules. By the time he would be gone, the paradise would be in danger. I don’t think that there was a specific way for him to ensure that Mikasa is safe by the time he would die than what he did."
Madagascar003,Madagascar003,"Perhaps things would have been different if Mikasa had been honest from the start and confessed her feelings to Eren. At the same time, Eren's fateful question caught her off guard, and she'd never considered the possibility that he might be interested in what she thought of him. Mikasa may have denied it, but deep down she'd never been able to suppress her feelings for Eren."
Madagascar003,Wild-Mushroom2404,"Hot take maybe but I always perceived the cabin thing as an alternate path that Eren created specifically for Mikasa. There is no way he would actually be willing to abandon everyone, including Armin, to fend for themselves. Eren isn't the kind of guy who would be able to live peacefully with a girl in a cabin away from the world, he could never give up his passion and drive like that. This is what Mikasa always wanted, not him, and he gave it to her as consolation and to further convince her to kill him. He shows her that it's a selfish, unattainable fantasy but at least she's allowed to have it outside of the real world."
Wild-Mushroom2404,TFYBneed_therapy,Neither would mikasa. This was an answer back to her question in ch123. This was ti show that despite both wanting to be together they couldn't with their friends at risk & eren still dying. The world was just too cruel to them.
Wild-Mushroom2404,NuuuDaBeast,"This is my interpretation too, there was no “fumbling” from Mikasa. The result would’ve been the same, Eren asking was just a final act for himself before he left them. Eren himself doesn’t understand love anyways so the question is very on brand too (this is supported by him saying Ymir “loved” King Fritz). 

There is absolutely ZERO chance Eren would’ve changed his mind based on her answer."
Wild-Mushroom2404,CelebrationVirtual17,"I agree with you that Eren wouldn’t abandon his friends but I think we can say Mikasa wouldn’t leave them either (at least not Armin). It’s not in character for her to tell him her true feelings either. It’s not in character for either of them to leave everyone to die. However, I do think you’re not factoring in the context that everyone in the cast is looking for a way out in this arc. Almost all of our characters say or do things to suggest it. I believe by this point, Reiner had contemplated suicide twice and almost just allowed himself to die bc he couldn’t take it anymore. Mikasa talks about wanting to go back home at several points since all of this chaos. Armin and Annie entertain the idea of a relationship before Armin comes to his senses and is disgusted with himself for having a moment like that while people are dying. In this scenario, Eren would have ran away bc when he asks her that, he wanted an escape from his own actions. The tragedy in it is that her response closes him off from that escape route he hoped for. Just like Reiner is denied death as his escape. Mikasa doesn’t get to go home. Armin has to come back to reality from his romcom confession lol. No one gets to escape. 🤷🏿‍♂️ that’s my take anyways"
CelebrationVirtual17,None,"Thank you for saying this. I’ve seen a lot of comments like OP’s where it comes off like Eren is essentially throwing Mikasa a bone as to her appease her “fantasies”. Mikasa is not a selfish person at all—I don’t understand why some commentors make it seem like she is. I also agree that Eren, deep down inside, WAS looking for a way out. Otherwise why show her this Paths vision at all? Mikasa isn’t some deluded bird, and it certainly isn’t in her character to run away. But I think for him, and only for him, she would. And for her, and only for her, he would’ve.

Ain’t no Mikasa slander on my watch. 🤷🏾‍♀️ "
Wild-Mushroom2404,Running_Gamer,Yeah this alternate timeline also disputes eren’s claim that he couldn’t change the future because no matter what the rumbling is something he’d always want to do. But apparently in this timeline that just never happened lmao
Wild-Mushroom2404,ErenMert21,"Exactly. Neither would be this selfish, he just showed her a lil what could have been"
Madagascar003,Sir_Toaster_9330,"Idea for another outcome: 

Eren and Mikasa brutally cripple the Marley military then force them into a treaty allowing for Paradis to get rich af and they can live their lives in peace."
Sir_Toaster_9330,ChiefsKingdom3288,"What about the other military from the other nations? 
It wasn’t just Marley that wanted them dead, it was the other great nations as well. Marley was just the greatest of the great nations as well as the one that had the most history with Eldians. 

Also… they kind of did that in part 1 of season 3. Armin destroyed their entire fleet and they did damage in land as well as taking their beast titans. Also if Erin and Mikasa were really going for blood they could have done more damage but it wouldn’t have mattered. 

The rest of the world would have retaliated and shit on them. They were just hysterically out numbered and out gunned due to them being behind in technology by about 100 years or so. 

Personally I still think peace could have been found but that’s one of the authors themes is that as long as humans are kicking, peace will never be truly achieved. If it is it will be short term because humans will always fight."
ChiefsKingdom3288,Sir_Toaster_9330,"I mean, if you defeated the greatest military in the world, then technically that would scare everyone out of conflict."
Madagascar003,None,This has got to be the most tragic love story in the history of anime. At least for me it is. 😔 
Madagascar003,General_Tart_9309,Yet they both lead to thousands if not millions of losses 😅
Madagascar003,Matthew_Winchester92,I wouldn't mind with this ending if they decided to run away together instead of eren plan that he had forgotten about that make no sense to me mikasa ending up with a random person and eren got nothing at the end

Cut to Eren kissing the back of Mikasa nape while she is cooking in her undies!




Would be um... interesting.
Eren fucking could have changed his fate!
That parallel timeline proves it
Eren dying in battle would have changed his fate!
Otherwise, there never was any stakes!

There was also a concept of him being ""locked in"" to the future as he has ""already done it and will do it"" at the same time. I like to think of it as all other outcomes would have been worse (for Eldians at least) and it was the only one that left Eldians with a Future."

Eren also wasn't raised to be an ethno masochistic, expendable child soldier.  He took no pride or joy out of killing people, his actions were all for the sake of his friends and homeland, he never thought himself better than any of them either."

FuzionGamr,None,I watched the series in full for the first time last year. Mikasa's feelings for him are obviously obvious. I think Eren was too preoccupied with finding and eliminating the enemy but subconsciously began to realize how he felt about her.
nan,Inform-All,"Playing devils advocate, Annie and Mikasa are much scarier than Gabi. She can shoot and all, but she doesn’t exactly seem super strong or skilled at martial arts. She certainly wasn’t an enemy shifter. Falco is still a chad for putting it out there. It just makes sense the others wouldn’t. Eren seemed to make his feelings clear when he knew death was imminent. Armin couldn’t confess to Annie before she unthawed."
Inform-All,None,"It's the fact that she's unhinged. One could easily approach Mikasa or Annie and try hold a conversation with them - worst they'd do is ignore you. Worst Gabi would do is verbally bite your head off.


And don't sell Gabi short either, she's an incredibly resourceful killer as shown by how she killed the prison guard, which is pictured here. Her unhinged side is highlighted by her repeatedly bashing his brains in with the brick after to make sure she finished the job.


If anything the fact she's younger than Mikasa and Annie were in S1 and lacks their Ackerman strength and martial arts respectively yet is still competently deadly makes her even more terrifying."
None,Inform-All,"I guess. To me, her “unhinged” side is only for “devils”. 100% killing the guard was resourceful, but not as terrifying to me as Annie and Mikasa being able to outright steamroll you, no stealth needed if you say the wrong thing."

As for Annie and Armin. Are we gonna ignore the fact that, she was considered an enemy to humanity inside the wall, killed a lot of the Scout Regiment, then fucked off and imprisoned herself in a crystal for 4 years. Probably would have been permanent if Eren didn't start the Rumbling.

Apparently mikasa married with Juan (or farmer kun another parent ) then eren is not only a pussy but also a pseudo-cuck

Reiner lived by plot armor lucky, fought a random worm (who disappeared in the end and the fight was pointless, ended sniffing a married woman letters)

Annie become armin waifu and trophy wife

Pieck said that she wanted to talk with eren after all the bad things that he did to her people 

Levi lived cuz editor-kun (aka kawakubo) wanted cuz he was planned to die, most useless char in all season 4


Mikasa cried over the genocidal eren for year after his death and visited his grave with her children.

Armin did barely nothing in the last fight and became new helos (a fake hero since mikasa was the one who killed eren not him)

Connie almost died to a random snake beast titan and got saved by levi (who got his legs bite by it) did nothing whole time.



While falco got the first canon flying titan, controled it in  few hours and without him the rumbling would've completed and the alliance would ve died and they wouldn't be able to kill eren, could confess his love unlike eren

If it’s not necrophilia it’s still definitely some form of SA.

- Eren no longer kills the people smugglers in the cabin. Huge part of his early characterization vaporised.

- Annie may well succeed in taking Eren without Mikasa slowing her down.
- Annie also likely escapes the battle in wall Sina without Mikasa's intervention.
- Louise (VALUABLE FUTURE JAEGERIST!!!) is dead. Mikasa was the only soldier able to kill the abnormal titan that nearly killed her.
- Historia (EPIC TRAD WIFE) is killed after the castle battle by a random titan.
- The battle in the cave has one less Ackerman killing the secret police.
- Serumbowl is over because Mikasa doesnt fight Levi so Erwin is revived (whether you like this or not SOMETHING HAS CHANGED)
- also Reiner may have defeated the cadets without Mikasa dealing the finishing blow at RTS
- Hizuru are less likely to make so many allowances to Paradis to reach Mikasa

BioLizard18,liquidheliumgrey,"Lmao this coming from the same people who overrate the hell out of Historia as a whole and still can't get over her destiny to be irrelevant at the end of the story. They say at least Armin made himself useful because he's smart, but how the fuck were they expecting their damsel in distress and selfish puppet queen to suddenly be at the forefront of a story that focuses on the military scouts? She was never written to be some clever political mind either. She's excused for doing absolutely nothing while knowing before anyone else that the rumbling would happen because it's all Isayamas fault as a writer that he failed their queen. But the utter hatred they have for Mikasa personally and not Isayama as a writer for not making her character the way they wanted her, is just so weird. 


I just finally watched Attack on Titan just this month and have never interacted with the fandom before. Learning that there was even the whole baby daddy drama was so hilarious and out of left field for me, and Titanfolkers as a whole. I had no idea there was such a strong hater boner for Mikasa either and that they merged with the same Historia simps. Binging the series, she was the least interesting and borderline annoying character and couldn't wait for her arc to be over. I was indifferent to Mikasa and indifferent to the ending. But I enjoyed watching the journey to get there and that makes up for it. 


Anyways: Erwin, Levi, Hange Supremacy 🙏"

Parking-Ad-6137,BioLizard18,I don't think they think through much at all.
BioLizard18,I_am_a_pan_fear_me,"Visited that sub and dear God they're a bunch of whiney morons. Saw a guy who called Isayama a cowardice because he made the Marleyans seem like people. Y'know instead of doing the **obviously realistic thing and make the enemy a bunch of nameless, faceless goons with no motive** (SARCASM)"
I_am_a_pan_fear_me,BioLizard18,"It's almost like as the series grew from fighting monsters you cant communicate with, so an essence of ""pride"" and triumph over a clear evil feels righteous, slowly turns morally grey as they come to understand the world is more complicated than they thought because their enemies are people just like them.

Its literally the clearest and most satisfying arc to show the growth of the characters, yet Titanfolkers would rather just fight evil baddies they can feel good about killing for their nationalistic tendencies."
BioLizard18,I_am_a_pan_fear_me,"They're a bunch of brats who want this complex and morally grey series about the horrors of war, prejudice and occupation. To be turned into another shitty wish fulfillment power fantasy Shonen where nameless baddies all get what they deserve.  

I dread the day any of them try to read something more complex than AOT. I would weep if they tried to bring their idiocy to the Berserk, Vagabond, Vinland Saga, or even the Tokyo Ghoul community."
BioLizard18,Recent_One_7983,Why do people act like mikasa is useless?? Most of her lines in the anime got changed too lines about eren and even THEN she’s still not useless maybe a bit annoying at best😭
Recent_One_7983,None,"I think people just dislike how bland, boring and undeveloped she was as a character,"
None,Recent_One_7983,I personally like mikasa so I’m probably biased in saying her character isn’t bland but I genuinely don’t think her character was underdeveloped I thought it represented what it was meant to though I’m speaking from a biased standpoint 😭
BioLizard18,None,Why would the want to take mi casa out
None,BioLizard18,They hate her because they ain't her.
BioLizard18,TxchnxnXD,Eren would’ve died multiple times
BioLizard18,bean_boy39,This post is literally attacking on retards lmao
BioLizard18,HangeTwo,Armin and Eren would both be dead
BioLizard18,miulumine,it's so aggravating i can't even form an actual thought 😭😭
BioLizard18,DucktorQuack,"Based on the post I think they were talking about Mikasa not being that much value adding to the trio specifically, not the story.  
  
To which I would say… how is that really all that relevant? Even if it wasn’t plot and just group dynamics, what’s wrong with someone taking a backseat and observing?  
  
But even then, the first time we see their dynamic as kids it’s obvious: Armin is smart but can’t defend himself, Eren jumps in without a second thought, and Mikasa is the one with the skills to make things happen.  
  
Edit: spacing"
DucktorQuack,BioLizard18,"I think even with that interpretation it just doesn't make much sense as a criticism. Its the same as saying nothing changes about the dynamic if we remove Armin because Mikasa and Eren would likely act the same to each other. Its a non-criticism.

If they wanted to say that Armin and Mikasa's dynamic was a bit weak, I'd agree with that. One more meaningful moment between them pre-timeskip would've been nice, but you can tell how much they care for each other."
BioLizard18,DucktorQuack,Definitely the former. There’s nothing of substance from the statement other than to dunk on Mikasa for no real reason aside from easy upvotes.
BioLizard18,Diavolo_79,"Okay, so the series ended and now the community is full of dumbasses. The first sub to unironically turn into the Anime equivalent of BatmanArkham 💀"
BioLizard18,chasm89,People really create entire subs to hate-read the coldest takes about their favorite shows huh
BioLizard18,Kani4life,"The point they are trying to make is that Eren wanted to kill Titans with or without Mikasa. She had nothing to do with his Titan hatred or love for the soldiers and wings of freedom. He would have found his way into the army regardless and all she was doing was doting over him and focused on his interests and what he wanted to achieve. Her whole purpose was to serve him(probably changed at the end). So em basically there still would have been a story to tell without her. 

However, Mikasa did play an important role and a likeable role in being the sexy female protector. She is second to Levi in Badass rating and arguable the strongest female anime character of all time(physically)"
BioLizard18,MemeMansGrandson,All the people in r/titanfolk do is whine and complain about the ending. They’re just like db fans they don’t read/watch the fucking series or they’re just stupid.
BioLizard18,ReddPwnage,Eren would be dead several times over
BioLizard18,SlothThoughts,"In the first one if you remove Eren and move Mikasa and Armin closer it looks like it could still be a title picture.

Edit. I thought I remembered a scene when Mikasa , Levi, Eren are having a lil rumble on the rooftops over who gets the spinal fluid and Levi only really got tense or serious when Mikasa started to go hands on or something. I just remember one of my take aways from the scene being "" Levi thinks he can no diff Eren at any situation and let's him get up in his face but when Mikasa starts to turn violent he gets a slight guard raised """
BioLizard18,ChainsawEnthusiast,Actually even though this is a stupid take someone should make a videos out of it and do a WHAT IF

BioLizard18,That-guy200,Yeahhh just erase Eren from that picture
BioLizard18,Gmz7601,Did they not watch the end or something? Mikasa was the key the entire time.
BioLizard18,None,"So basically they want to remove Erens insecurities, his longing for home and embodiment of his regrets throughout the story and especially at climax lol."
BioLizard18,mr-harajuku,That’s what makes AOT such a strong story. Every character’s small actions  have a large impact on the path of the linear story. When the story starts to become circular then you can make the argument of otherwise
BioLizard18,None,What a gaggle of incels
BioLizard18,Qprah,"I found that post pretty funny just because Armin and Eren actually are looking at each other in every picture and Mikasa is just there.

But also like... If you are out playing with your bestie and you have your sister tagging along, and she doesnt say much but just likes to be there, then yeah of course.

But like obviously there is no deeper meaning to the 3 kids being depicted that way when they were literally children.  
Its cope when they convince themselves it means something more.

BioLizard18,hyperhyperproto,"I dont like mikasa, she's not a character, she's a cardboard cutout of a character, watching the show is painful whenever she's on screen. I could say the same about eren."
BioLizard18,AnimeTutilage,"Imma be honest, without rewatching the anime I don’t even remember Mikasa’s character. She just all the sudden became important in like the last season of the anime and I just did not care about her or her relationship with Eren. I would sooner believe Armin and Erin would be a thing than them two. 

Can someone explain why they like Mikasa? Because she seems rather bland. It’s like she technically did things, but just replace a lot of her actions with just another character and not much changes."
AnimeTutilage,BioLizard18,"I like Mikasa because her arc of learning to care for others and putting the greater good above her own desires and feelings is admirable and endearing.

People on TF dislike her cause she got in the way of their made up ship."
BioLizard18,AnimeTutilage,Who did she learn to care about? I don’t remember her having a meaningful conversation with any character. Also her putting the greater good of many over her feelings for a guy who doesn’t talk to her or care about her much on screen is like the bare minimum. It’s not really admirable or impressive in my opinion.

Khaled-oti,BioLizard18,Hot take: Sakura is actually a pretty good character. She only suffers because she's the third wheel to Naruto and Sasuke's S+++++ dynamic.

Stoner420Eren,Memo544,MAPPA handled the larger titans in an amazing way. I'm really happy with it. There were definite flaws with WIT's animation that MAPPA improved off of.

Eliteslayer1775,Limp-Day-97,"Disagree honestly, I prefer Mappas 2D, feels a lot more detailed and I like the more gritty look as well. For 3D I also prefer Mappa however I don't like that they almost always used CGI for titans, especially in S4p1"

SafeStaff7671,Stoner420Eren,My honest reaction
Stoner420Eren,Dr-Oktavius,"Why was the colossal of all things cg in s3? I get that making characters CGI saves up money because you don't gotta draw them in every frame anymore, but with how little screen time the colossal has in s3, I don't see how making a whole character model for him was cheaper than just drawing him in."
Dr-Oktavius,Barbiefan79,"time contsraints, cg is easier to work with than 2d (still hard tho to get it right as we saw in the season)"
Barbiefan79,Dr-Oktavius,"Yeah but how? He barely has any screen time in s3, how is it more time efficient to create a whole model just for a few scenes?"
Dr-Oktavius,battleooze1615,"It’s more that using 3D is WAY easier for such a big character. Same thing goes for complex machinery. It’s why most cars, planes, military equipment, mechs, etc are all CG. It’s either really big or complex. The colossal is somewhat both as he’s not only massive but has a lot of detail with the muscles and such."

Brave_Branch2619,manboise,Nobody truly knows if an afterlife exists in Aot besides Yams.
manboise,Configuringsausage,I mean ymir’s alive after dying.  She’s a unique case but she is in the afterlife
Configuringsausage,ObeyeablePage,I don't think it was so much Ymir herself as it was an imprint of her passed on through the Titan powers.
Configuringsausage,Electronic_Issue_978,"Ymir is the founder. As Birdren showed us, the founder can pretty much do whatever they want. They can make whatever they put their mind to, shape themselves(and others) however they please, and they never truly die."
manboise,SpaceMan026,Only ymir knows
manboise,None,The scouts ghosts:
Brave_Branch2619,alkasdala,Mfw AoT's world is parallel to ours and the concept of an afterlife is just as murky and unknowable:
alkasdala,Puzzleheaded_Sky9724,There is large supernatural essence in AOT especially with the little centipede thing(forgot its name) who is kind of like God.
Puzzleheaded_Sky9724,alkasdala,"I disagree. Like, yeah, there are supernatural elements, but Isayama never went for a fully fantasy route. The hallucigenia is ""the origin of life"", but, at the end of the day, it's still just a parasitic creature.
We don't know why it has the powers it has, and no explanation has been given, which means anything is possible just like in real life."
Puzzleheaded_Sky9724,labree0,"the centiped linked everyone together by a single race, it wasn't an ""afterlife"".

it contained the consciousnesses of those people, but after the titan powers were turned off, so was the linking. the racial afterlife went with it, afaik."
Puzzleheaded_Sky9724,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"""God"" is just a name we put on the unknowable. AOT's universe isn't incompatible with the Christian God, he'd just have worked in even more mysterious ways"
Puzzleheaded_Sky9724,Tobias_Mercury,I saw the centipede more like a force of nature than a god
Brave_Branch2619,oostie,Who says there is?
oostie,throwawayhelp32414,"There are only 2 scenes where one could really argue this

and both scenes are \**chefs kiss*\* 

The show would lose something without that Hange scene, and the final Levi salute."
throwawayhelp32414,ianman729,also both can easily be interpreted as abstract visions
throwawayhelp32414,KickofGum,It’s not the afterlife or a vision. It’s the world of the paths. It seems the world of the paths is another plane of existence and only “the source of all life” can bridge them. So whether or not there is an after life after Ymir let’s go is totally unknown.
throwawayhelp32414,King_mf_Brandor,"I saw them as their versions of Eren’s final visit. I believe Eren brought Erwin and co to talk to Hange at her death, the same way he used the paths to communicate with everyone else. Levi’s is a little more murky since Eren is technically dead by that point, but I figure it’s probably just what he did with the last of his power"
throwawayhelp32414,None,"I'm no expert, but I think it's explained to some degree. There WAS an afterlife, but only for Eldians. Ymir made it so. There's a line in the finale about it in the finale. Even if an Eldian died, they still existed in some form in paths. That's why she was able to summon the titans of past users to protect Eren. Those titans were genuinely the dead coming back to fight the scouts. They were mostly under Ymir's control, but clearly had some sort of autonomy. 


We can assume the dead are always lingering throughout the series. When Erwin says he feels his dead comrades watching, he's right. In a first watch through you can assume it's more a figure of speech, but on rewatch it becomes likely that paths are allowing him to subconsciously feel them. It's likely those shots we see of the dead behind him are based in reality.


Levi actually got to see his friends in the end. Hange actually got to join her comrades in death.


This is purely a construct of titan powers though. Once titan powers cease the dead dissappear soon after. 


So yes Attack on Titan does confirm the existence of the afterlife, but it's only for Eldians and entirely reliant on Titan powers. That afterlife no longer exists at the end of the show. "
oostie,Odd_Appearance7123,I think what happened to Hange after she died is pretty telling of an afterlife.
Odd_Appearance7123,Lesterberne,It sounds like paths to me
Odd_Appearance7123,atlas_island,does everyone just stand around on earth in the afterlife?
Odd_Appearance7123,oostie,You don’t think that could’ve been symbolic or something along those lines? I’m not gonna say that’s not a valid interpretation of that scene. It definitely is bud. You could read into that in a lot of ways.
Odd_Appearance7123,548662,"It could be interpreted that way but it could be anything. They could’ve been hallucinating in their last moments or it could’ve been entirely metaphorical. Same thing with Levi seeing his deceased comrades, or Jean and Connie seeing Sasha. No confirmation either way."
Odd_Appearance7123,iyav,"It's just a cliché as old as time that was uncritically regurgitated by Yams, there's not much to it.

Levi's scene is also the same but if you did want to analyze it, I'd argue that it is communicating that they're dead for real now given how they fade away in the distance now that the paths have collapsed.  
The paths realm *was* the limbo dimension keeping their souls around.  
Now they've disintegrated into nothingness."
oostie,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"There's a motte-and-bailey or miscommunication that might be in play here

On one hand -- the explicit text of the story is that the Founder (or hallu-chan or whatever) keeps people's souls around after their deaths. Ymir dies. Bertholdt dies. And yet they still have agency and affect the story after their lives ended. (Come to think of it -- there's some commentary here about how Sasha affects the story after her life ended, too, but that's clearly another topic)

But on the other, there's the question of how Hange tells her story to Erwin after her death. And there's the question of what happens to Ymir and everyone after 138, to what extend that Armin is being literal about reuniting with Eren in hell"
Brave_Branch2619,Sir_Toaster_9330,One could argue that Paths is the Eldian Afterlife
Sir_Toaster_9330,clowncarl,Lol eren deleted afterlife so his friends can live a few more years.
clowncarl,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,ngl I'm pretty sure that I'd rather cease to exist than linger in the half-conscious purgatory that was how Ymir described being a pure Titan. And that's probably how Bertholdt and the others persisted in PATHS
clowncarl,VoidUnity,What an asshole
Sir_Toaster_9330,Puzzleheaded_Sky9724,That’s a good take
Sir_Toaster_9330,spiderknight616,Paths don't exist anymore after the ending though
spiderknight616,Nenanda,I mean didnt ending imply it is coming back in some capacity?
spiderknight616,Configuringsausage,Didn’t they exist again after the loop thing
Sir_Toaster_9330,ConnorTheCorn23,I like to imagine it’s like Valhalla from Norse mythology
ConnorTheCorn23,Sir_Toaster_9330,"I had a similar idea too, but I assumed the Paths made more sense"
Brave_Branch2619,Lxnaspiral,is this a bojack horseman spoiler
Lxnaspiral,None,"Yes,but without context this is kinda ambiguous. So someone who hasn't seen it wouldn't really learn anything"
Lxnaspiral,A_Big_Rat,"Yes, but also no"
Brave_Branch2619,Sir_Toaster_9330,Personal headcanon: Hanji and most of the dead Survey Corps characters are in Valhalla
Brave_Branch2619,kazsvk,Well Yams did bring up God when Sasha asked why Onyanpokon had different colored skin. It's kinda baked into the story but removing the aspect of the afterlife does offer an interesting perspective contrary to what I personally believe.
Brave_Branch2619,ravatos626,"Its ambigous just like real life, if we see it from an atheistic view paths could be nothing more but a memory bank of the eldian race, the beings in there being simple hollow recreations from their memory, while if he see it from a religious view paths is a sort of purgatory, it can be seen both ways"
Brave_Branch2619,1-Canadian-Boy,is there a definitive example of the afterlife in AOT?
1-Canadian-Boy,Shadow_Wolf_X871,Technically the paths-
Shadow_Wolf_X871,InterestingLab5216,Meh the paths connect people but no one is like dead chilling in the paths.
Shadow_Wolf_X871,1-Canadian-Boy,paths only apply to Eldians
Brave_Branch2619,MarinemainEtG,"What is this, a crossover episode?"
Brave_Branch2619,Iokyt,Personally I find The Paths being this giant Eldian Discord server much worse than the 2 scenes implying heaven.

Brave_Branch2619,None,This episode of Bojack Horseman was nightmare material
Brave_Branch2619,Goobsmoob,"The story never directly confirms an afterlife. Hange’s is the closest we get but that also could just be a death hallucination.

I know several stories that have characters hallucinate/talk with dead characters despite the fact an afterlife doesn’t exist in that universe."

Brave_Branch2619,CumFilledAntNest,"I find those ""afterlife"" scenes to be mostly metaphoric, it's not that clear whether they are actually real or not"

Brave_Branch2619,Jerry98x,"It was Paths-related, not an afterlife how people are used to imagine"
Brave_Branch2619,goodguyScratch1,"Well tbh it seemed like their after life was due to being descendents of Ymir, and once the power of the titans were wiped from the earth the afterlife also faded (Ymir was keeping them all alive so she could have people close to her) (my take)"
Brave_Branch2619,None,It's not so much that there's a heaven or something. More like all their energies are connected forever.  They live on through the living.
Brave_Branch2619,Victurix1,"Originally I was gonna say that Hange's scene is the paths and Levi is hallucinating, but after rewatching the Levi scene and realizing that Jean and Conny also saw Sasha in it, I think I will say that both instances are the paths.

The dead scouts are giving them a final farewell, before the paths disappear."
Brave_Branch2619,LonelyCareer,The only afterlife we've seen is the paths
Brave_Branch2619,QueenHistoria1990,"I don’t think there’s anything particularly religious about the AoT afterlife, it’s more generic like an alternate reality/parallel world.

I thought that’s why the Scouts could see their fallen comrades in the end, including Hange’s death and subsequent reunion with Erwin & the gang. Plus the final ED implying Mikasa found Eren again upon her death."
Brave_Branch2619,ErenMert21,Well we dont know
Brave_Branch2619,McBaws21,"i interpreted that as just titan power paths fuclery, not an actual afterlife. after eren ends the curse there is no more “afterlife”"

Brave_Branch2619,whatsreal45,"Also, there wouldn’t be an attack on Titan if it wasn’t for the afterlife. it will be impossible for him to write the same story if he didn’t have an afterlife involved …its part of the plot"
Brave_Branch2619,Puzzleheaded_Sky9724,Idk. I think I’d prefer it if there was so characters could reunite and be together again. I’m a sucker for happy shit like that. I also feel like it’s not reaching if there is one with all the supernatural stuff we’ve seen like the paths which someone mentioned were like an afterlife for Eldians.
Brave_Branch2619,Stoner420Eren,"I don't think it exists. I always thought the scene after Hange's death was more symbolic than anything. Also Eren and Armin talking about hell in the anime, they aren't confirmation of an afterlife imho"
Brave_Branch2619,TobbyTukaywan,"The only confirmed ""afterlife"" in AoT is the paths, and those probably cease to exist with the ending of the titan curse. Other than that, there is no evidence or hints either way."
Brave_Branch2619,SelectionMuted3160,I don’t think there is an afterlife in AOT
Brave_Branch2619,ErenYeager854835,"I mean Ymir was still shown to have consciousness, and be alive again after being dead, so Ymir must have transcended to somewhere else right? 

Hange met all the dead scouts again after she died, and there was Floch too, it was clear and wasn't any symbolism.

Levi could see the dead scouts again, and Connie could see Sasha once more.

And the ed 9 (if you take it as canon), shows Eren again in the afterlife,

So from all this, we can actually conclude that afterlife is canon in AoT, and it's a common place (there's no division like Hell or Heaven)."
Brave_Branch2619,Dhaubbu,There isn't.
Brave_Branch2619,lakers_nation24,"I mean all eldians are one with the coordinate, where life and death don’t exist and time isn’t a concept. It sort of is an eternal state of being for all eldians, and was wiped away after eren freed Ymir and the power of the titans and paths were ended by Ymir."
Brave_Branch2619,ghosteonpai,Bojack horseman was in attack on titans? Man I need to watch this now. What episode did he appear in?
Brave_Branch2619,Yukitze,"I’d prefer if eldians get their own place when they die, and Eren along with the others who’ve died have been building such place ever since he died, like Ymir was building titans except more wholesome."

Hollow_Blue,gratitudeisbs,She literally killed Eren the guy that saved her pathetic life and took her in. There’s nothing she wouldn’t do to save some racist bigots who happily tortured innocents for years and if they could would kill her and everyone she knows.
gratitudeisbs,Hollow_Blue,Any choice Mikasa makes will never be enough for you because you hate her character. So it makes sense that you exaggerate and twist everything she does to fit your own narrative. She loves Historia and would never slice an unborn child out of her. That’s ridiculous.
gratitudeisbs,someonesgranpa,She had to be literally talk no jutsu into killing him. It wasn’t like she killed him in cold blood. It was her destiny to do so. She merely acted upon a prophetic stroke of tragedy.

But not in a sigma freedom warrior way, rather an Ancient Greek tragedy way. His blind desire to protect his friends is what directly leads to their death, a self-fulfilling prophecy. Eren becomes truly free… by being the last person on Earth. No one is there to restrain anymore. No walls, no nothing. A blank slate. He’s become Death, the destroyer of worlds.

The_Kyojuro_Rengoku,rephosolif,"The avengers getting together to beat the bad guy ( but the bad guy wanted to lose so there was no tension) and the series turning from what it was into a complete romance was pretty ass. Multiple times in the ending did they do something for pure shock value, like turning the humans into titans just for them to turn back to normal. Like the worm thing showing up out of nowhere and then saying it'll "" start the rumbling again"" even though the rumbling already ended. Everyone's dads moms sister brothers conveniently survived and in the final battle of the series midway through they go to hang out with them. Not being able to name a single thing Armin did this entire season that was true to him, he could literally just be anyone else with how bland he became. Do people actually think Mikasa is a well written character? She's in love with the MC (who's like her brother but whatever) and that's it, it's just so hard to care about the romance in this show"

Forgot Ymir and that it was her that wanted to do that. If they got killed what was the point of eren saving his friends? 

Imagine having such a one digit iq that you think series turns into ""romance"".yeah final chapter was all about eremika and ymir and king fingering each other with love talks. It was about love death and duty you dumbfuck. 

What did any of the main cast do? This is a plot driven fiction not character driven. Idk tf you expecting.

Shattered_Sans,RubyWubs,What is ANR??
RubyWubs,Hufflepuff173,"There was a music video that showed Eren returning to the island after killing the entirety of the outside world and all of his friends. Then he mourns for the rest of his life but it was necessary yada yada yada. Some people thought it was a hint at the real ending, and people still delude themselves into thinking that it was the REAL ending, and the actual ending is somehow invalid."
RubyWubs,Shattered_Sans,"A bad theory based on (and named after) the music video for Akatsuki no Requiem. Essentially, some people thought the story was going to end with Eren killing all of his friends, completing the Rumbling, returning to the island to live with Historia and their child, and showing his younger self through future memories what he did, and why he had to do it."
Shattered_Sans,Cygus_Lorman,Wasn't there an *actual* first ending where Eren and co. were supposed to die after killing Reiner and Bertholdt in a pyrrhic victory?
Cygus_Lorman,DrJankTWD,"As I understand it, ""everyone dies"" was the contingency plan early on if the series ends up getting cancelled quickly. It was never how the story was 'supposed' to go, but it was the alternative if the story couldn't go that was.

We all know AoT as a best-seller, but that was far from guaranteed. It had questionable art and was created by a debuting author in a newly established magazine with no established audience. There was a good chance that the series would not have been successful in the magazine, and even if it did moderately ok, there was a chance that the magazine doesn't find an audience and stops publication (Sometimes series from failing magazines get serialized somewhere else if they're popular enough, but mid-list titles may just end up getting cancelled in this situation)."
Shattered_Sans,Pengoui,"As far as I heard it wasn't always the planned ending, in an old interview he said he was planning on nearly every character dying in the end, but after the show got so popular, he felt his larger audience would be angry with that ending so he thought of a new one."
Pengoui,Shattered_Sans,He never said that.
Shattered_Sans,Deep-Handle9955,"In my head Ymir was Iseyama's self insert character. The god who had the power to create and take away titans. And the one who wanted to end the story with Mikasa chopping Eren. Ymir represents all the hatred he felt when he started AOT and the twisted sense of love he had back then. And in a way he was honestly showing us how the show helped him get rid of that hate.

To the point where you have to make up conspiracy theories and delusions to cope? The fragility of the ego, man…  

Also, that side of the fandom’s obsession with Mikasa NOT being able to be loved back is just….sad. I don’t even think it’s about some naysayers thinking that “there should have been more signs from Eren” at this point. They just hate that she was loved back. Just like they hate that Eren was always a deeply flawed, imperfect person who fucked up and lacked a lot of maturity despite his thoughts and feelings.  I’m starting to think that Mikasa has always just been  “in the way” of people in the fandom’s parasocial relationship with Eren. It’s so fucking bizarre. "

If someone is that disturbed in that type of wish, why would I take any of their opinions on what “should” have happened seriously? Especially to the girl who is literally Isayama’s signature? Lol"
None,rephosolif,"Is it cope to say that Eren loving Mikasa should have been foreshadowed at least a little bit? And what is Eren crying about? Is it the fact that he's about to die? That he's ashamed of what he's done? No it's cause Armin brought up Mikasa possibly loving another guy, someone who he's never shown any feelings for. The entire convo Eren is talking in a very assertive way, he's known everything that's happened so far and be knows it has to be this way, until it gets to Mikasa. Either way they shoehorned the crappy love story in. Attack on Titan should have NEVER been resolved through romance. I only like the Ymir stuff cause it's seemingly the only part of the last few chapters that was foreshadowed/ planned for a long time, but even that's still weird. And Eren can show emotion, my 3rd favorite scene in the series is when Eren is crying to the little kid he knows he's gonna kill, iirc he mentions Hange and Sashas death, that's when he should have cried for sure."
rephosolif,None,"It's not a cope to say that it could have been better if his feelings for Mikasa were shown \*more.\* That's understandable, sure. But it is a cope to say that there was nothing \*at all\*, that he \*never\* showed any feelings for her.  And when people point out these scenes that show this, even scenes some may seem explicit,  they get rejected and dismissed as not being legitimate.  So what's the point in arguing about this? If it's not enough or convincing for you, just say that. But that's a completely different statement then saying there's nothing at all. That's my point. And we see things very different about how Eren was communicating to Armin, so I can't even agree that he was speaking ""assertively"" but if that's how you interpret it then okay!

It's not shoehorned in, it's just a tragedy because they were never going to be together. and besides, romance is not even how AOT was ""resolved."""

TheUsrTheUsr,Lobsters4Dinner,It takes a lot of character to admit when you're wrong and these people got *everything* wrong. No one wants to admit they misread a comic book for years. They *need* to believe the story was retconned. All this noise regarding alternative endings only exists to reconcile the fact they never understood their supposed favorite story.
Lobsters4Dinner,None,This. All of this. 
TheUsrTheUsr,None,"hold on, wasn’t it isayamas statement that he had the ending planned out from the beginning? i get not liking the ending but making up lies over it is just crybaby behavior"
TheUsrTheUsr,Usual_Court_8859,Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who thought from the beginning that Eren would end up with Mikasa.
Usual_Court_8859,None,"Same (in the sense that he returned her feelings, not necessarily ending up together as Eren’s behavior was always wild card for me and I wasn’t sure if him and a couple other characters would make it). It was so obvious to me the story was going in that direction, I never once questioned it. There’s way too many other important and interesting shit going on and unexpected in AOT, and for me Eremika isn’t one of them or isn’t worth wasting time on trying to figure out because it’s just simply there. But then again, I’ve gone through this same exact thought process with other canon relationships from other fandoms  I thought were obvious but the fandoms discourse think otherwise….🙃😵‍💫"
None,None,"Its like people forget that whole scene where Eren punches the titan of Dina Fritz and theres a romantic scene with Mikasa that is not subtle at all. Sure i think maybe there should have been more interaction between them overall, but it was setup from the start"

TheUsrTheUsr,THE_WRAITHLORD,"If this ending was so controversial, Yams obviously made the ending he wanted to make.

Eren definitely initiated the Rumbling and prevented Mikasa from becoming the Attack Titan because he didn’t care about her.

He probably actually was pressured, considering the Levi death asspulls, but he legit admitted for the start that he had attempted to make it as popular as possible, even compromising his dream for that end.

We don’t have a Disney ending; Armin’s goodbye alone is more than enough for that point to stand."

Eren’s dead, he and Mikasa never got together, 1,6 billion people died and fascism is on the rise in Paradis Island.

TheUsrTheUsr,floormopper,Japanese fans literally pressured the editors because most people in Japan were massive eren x Mikasa supporters.
floormopper,TheUsrTheUsr,"Give me one valid source that proves this is true. 

Because whether it be with Isayama’s interview with NYT or in the AOT guidebook, he’s always explained that he had to stick to this ending, he stuck to it so much that he said that he felt like he was limiting his own creative freedom."
TheUsrTheUsr,floormopper,I never talked about isayama I specifically said his editor. Basically the entire editors were pressured by the public because in Japan eren x Mikasa is a big thing.

Reasonable_Carob2534,digbick_42069,Nah I wholeheartedly agree with you. I also wished there was much more of Eren's perspective throughout the final season.
digbick_42069,Fallofmen10,Yah it was kind of a whiplash. First 3 seasons he was your typical shonen type beat with a bit more bloodlust. Cool character but not the best. Post time skip Eren is so engaging and interesting on so many levels. I get why his perspective was basically cut off.... but man did I miss it. He was the best part of all of s4
Fallofmen10,Krawlin91,"Part of the intrigue is the mystery, he is almost a completely different character and it is apparent from the get go, if we knew what he knew not only would it spoil the rest of the story (he literally knew everything that was going to happen) it would just make his character depressing AF"
digbick_42069,Reasonable_Carob2534,"Thank you for responding :) I think limiting the amount of his mindset we see creates a lot of intrigue and really makes us feel as lost as the other characters do when it comes to Eren, but still I would get on my knees for some Eren POV crumbs."
digbick_42069,Rasnall,But Eren died when Gabby removed his head. That's why there was nothing else from his POV until the very end. Also to have his POV during the invasion ark would have just given the story away
Rasnall,None,He didn't die after Gabby shot him. He's whole again when Mikasa kills him. Also we get Eren focus right after Gabby shoots him.
Rasnall,digbick_42069,You do realize Season 4 didn't start with Eren getting decapitated right?? I'm talking about all the way back to the 1st episode of season 4.
digbick_42069,brogrammer1992,"As much as I hate the “twist”, I agree with you.

Some simple character development with his power ups showcasing how power just takes away more of us freedom post Return would have been great.

It was a clear theme up to then:
1.Threatened by the garrison.
2. Imprisoned 
3. Subordinate to Levi.
4. Babysat until he is kidnapped.
5. Literally at Historias mercy.

Hell it starts before he gets his titan powers.

Instead, he gets nearly unlimited forsight, immense power, and apparently bootstrap paradox’s his way into genocide.

We get his constipated face after kissing historia, and he actively fucks with the timeline.

They don’t earn his mental breakdown.

His time as founder we could’ve seen him seeing every other future where is loved ones die.

Something."
brogrammer1992,ErenMert21,Wait what twist? Also there was not really time to explore  his psyche and no reason too. We alr had 131 for that
digbick_42069,Dry-Introduction-491,"Ehhhhh, I think that’s part of what makes S4 so special, Final Chapters should’ve been mostly from Eren’s perspective tho"
Reasonable_Carob2534,Clean-Sector-1085,"The psychology is quite mad, Nietzsche and Freud would love this guy"
Clean-Sector-1085,Reasonable_Carob2534,You get it
Reasonable_Carob2534,Icaro04,They did in the last episode with armin
Icaro04,Reasonable_Carob2534,"i meant more in a show, don’t tell way."
Reasonable_Carob2534,wagshockey,"I think the convo with Armin was for in case anyone missed that Eren’s (villainous) mindset while self loathing is also extremely selfish, we saw there was a timeline where he runs away with Mikasa, but he chose the rumbling. Yes war continued as is in that timeline, but it also in the rumbling timeline. Eren throughout S4 and the final seasons exhibits is convincing himself the rumbling is for the greater good, it’s not Eren wanted a sandbox of a world to play in and took it personally when that wasn’t the case and blamed the world because it made him so it deserves him. Hilariously kinda close to Batman’s quote “I am the hero Gotham deserves” it’s just Eren is no hero."
Icaro04,someloserontheground,Literally just writing dialogue explaining everything is awful writing and not satisfying for the viewer in any way
someloserontheground,Icaro04,"Totally true, but some people need the exact transcription in words of what the character want"
someloserontheground,Lesterberne,Can you give an example of that in the final chapter? Cauz i felt a lot of it was more show don’t tell
Reasonable_Carob2534,YoManWTFIsThisShit,"I think his character post-time-skip is subtly sprinkled throughout the first three seasons. Take for example his motivation to save Mikasa and Armin was revealed when Eren Kruger asked Grisha that if he wanted to save Mikasa and Armin, which Grisha didn’t know who they were, and Eren asking himself who’s memories he’s seeing."
Reasonable_Carob2534,One_Somewhere_4112,This was one of the main complaints while the series ongoing monthly updates until the end of
One_Somewhere_4112,brogrammer1992,"Yep, it’s why so much coping occurred until the end, we couldn’t see inside his gead"
One_Somewhere_4112,Reasonable_Carob2534,That’s interesting! I’ve only recently gotten into this fandom so I’m not too familiar.
Reasonable_Carob2534,YardOk5005,"I always saw Eren’s change as him trying ‘something new’ since it follows a theory I love that Eren’s future self is constantly manipulating his past self via how the Attack Titan inheritors can receive memories from the future as well as the past. 

This is linked to the first chapter in the manga and the anime (I think it’s been a long while) where Eren talks to Mikasa about the future, like her hair being short. 

So theory goes that Eren is trying to find a ‘perfect’ timeline where everything goes according to plan and the people he loves gets a happy ending. Ofc, it’s not perfect perfect, since Sasha dies and he was expecting it but I’d say 8/10 is better than 0/10.

I saw the part where Mikasa and Eren run away as a previous timeline where Eren did what he wanted and I see the current timeline where he starts the rumbling as him sacrificing himself for his friends even though he wants to live with them.

So he does things like guiding the smiling titan to eat his mother in order to keep Berthold alive, and in the same way he forced his own father to kill the royal family in order to steal the Progenitor Titan; he’s been manipulating the past to get a ‘good ending’ for his friends. 

One where War ends. 

This can also be seen when Eren’s dad meets the Owl and the Owl says,

“If you want to save them all… Mikasa, Armin and the others… Carry out your mission until the end.”

I always saw this as Eren’s desires leaking even the past users because he wishes to keep all of them safe. 

I’d even go as far as to say, Eren was the reason Grisha lead his sister to go outside therefore ensuring he met Diana, Zeke was born and Eren afterwards.

He’s definitely capable of it since he got the smiling titan to eat his own mother, therefore ensuring Armin became the future Colossal Titan and that his younger self would hate titans: creating the plot we read/watched in order to take revenge. 

As well as forcing his dad to massacre a family. 

So yeah, at least in my head canon, the moment after ‘The End’ Eren wakes up underneath that tree on a hill, confused about his dream and ready to repeat the story; albeit with a few changes in order to get that happy ending he’s been looking for.

Saying that, I’m definitely a little biased since I really like time stuff like regression (when done right)

Anyways, I saw the post and got reminded of all this so thanks for the blast from the past.

Also it does suck Fr that we barely see Eren in the latter half, granted it makes sense from a narrative standpoint since there’s supposed to be that whole ‘he becomes a villain’ thing while his friends try to stop him but as you said it would’ve been nicer to see what Eren was thinking before he straight up told us. 

Felt like his main character status got switched to antagonist for plot reasons.

Edit: should’ve reread through my comment, and sorry for posting an essay I just really like the theory"
YardOk5005,Gabryblynd,"so, if i undertand you. You're saying that, at least in your headcanon, Eren sends messages to his past self so that he may one day achieve an 'happy ending' for him and friends?"
Gabryblynd,YardOk5005,"I wouldn’t say ‘sends messages’ more manipulates situations, including those involving his younger self in order to get what he wants out of a situation.

Eg: he ensures Armin becomes the Colossal Titan by keeping Bert alive until X in the story.

It might be cope that he continuously tries again and again but I’d say there’s enough evidence, like the beginning where young Eren wakes up from a dream about the future, to say that it’s possible. 

It would explain a lot of things, like how Eren as a nine- year old child was able to murder 2 full grown adults. 

His future self filled him with hatred for the kidnappers, made him give his speech about ‘If you don’t fight, we can’t win’ to Mikasa which led to them becoming close and her awakening her Ackerman blood. 

Just to say, what I mean by him manipulating is the way he uses both the Founding Titan and the Attack Titan. 

For example, he selectively feeds his father information about the future and practically coheres him into stealing the FT which he later gives to himself. 

He used the speech Kruger gave Grisha in order to reignite his anger.

‘Stand’ ‘Even if we die’ and ‘This is the story you started’ 

This made Grisha remember his lost loved ones, fallen comrades and the oppression the Eldians faced: leading him to following Eren’s version of the future. 

He uses the FT to guide the Smiling Titan away from Bert so what’s to say he hasn’t used it in other instances. 

The tries again and again part is his future self changing his actions. In other words, using the future to change the past. 

As a result the future changes and since X didn’t happen, Y didn’t either.

Let’s say, Eren used his Founding Titan powers to save his mother, instead of the smiling titan eating her, she ate Berthold.

- The Colossal Titan wouldn’t be available to the Eldians, changing what they can do strategically when fighting against the world 

- Eren’s mother survives, meaning that Eren wouldn’t swear endless revenge against the Titans, destroying the plot of AoT

Because he kept Bertholdt alive: his mother died and his younger self swore revenge on the titans, the Eldians eventually got the Colossal Titan as theirs and it was given to Armin then used to fight the world. 

In the next ‘beginning’ once Eren opens his eyes and awakes from his ‘dream, his future self may change certain actions.

For example, maybe he doesn’t see memories of his future leading him down the path of nihilism and destruction (The Rumbling).

Of course, this is all a theory but I like it at least. 

Maybe Eren was just born a little crazy, which allowed him to kill.

Maybe his older self didn’t use his powers beyond what we were shown, where he manipulated Grisha.

Maybe, the beginning about future events was just a ‘fun reference’ Isayama put in. 

Again it might be I’m huffing copeium but it’s what I choose to believe because I find it more interesting.

Edit: sorry for making another essay xD

Time travel is really cool to me, a fun video to watch is a short movie called ‘Stalled’. The time travel in their is done really well"
Reasonable_Carob2534,ItalianStallion9069,I agree
Reasonable_Carob2534,__Raxy__,fr we got 3 seasons with him and his perspective to get nothing for the 4th until the last ep
Reasonable_Carob2534,stronged_cheese,The best way I view how Eren viewed the rumbling is if you watch the first few episodes of AoT right before watching the final chapters
Reasonable_Carob2534,Retrac752,"All I want is one shot of him looking down, and he's walking on the beach and feeling the sand between his toes

Then it cuts to him looking down while stepping on cities and buildings and women and children during the rumbling

He's experiencing all of time at once, so from his perspective this would all be blending together"
Retrac752,Madmandusa,You’re a genius. You should absolutely write stories
Reasonable_Carob2534,Living-Try-9908,"I feel like the anime covered his perspective in a great creative way with the openings and endings. The Rumbling song is basically giving you his internal thoughts in metal form. It was enough for me. Besides, the audience can conclude what he is thinking from what we already know about the character. Not every part of the story should be spoon fed to us."
Reasonable_Carob2534,monisharif33,"This one singular thing would perfect AOT. I truly believe this is the one reason behind why the fandom is so split when it comes to the ending. Never seeing Eren's POV made people think he had some Light Yagami/Lelouch level plan that would blow all of our minds when revealed. It caused the expectations to be high. We always saw Light Yagami's mental descent into madness but with Eren, we had nothing."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Optimal_Bit_5600,"I'm a bit split on it. On one hand, the fact that we *were* so distant from Eren was what made him so fascinating to watch for most of the final season. He went from a hotheaded but still fairly typical anime protagonist, to this cold hearted and focused terrorist who was making enemies out of everyone around him. He felt like a force of nature and his motivation was probably the biggest mystery of S4. Then when it was revealed that he was out to destroy the entire world for the sake of his loved ones, it made so much so sense and felt like a gut punch.

It was after this point though where I do wish we got more from him. I do get Isayama's desire to focus on the supporting characters and the innocent civilians. The rumbling is a harrowing scenario and getting the POV of everyone impacted by it is crucial. But Eren's time during the final stretch of the story is so goddamn tragic. He basically becomes god with access to knowledge from all of history, having no concept of time or place anymore. There is still that childish part of him that is over the moon because he's finally achieving his dream of exploring a barren landscape, but that fantasy doesn't last forever. He is a depressed and burdened person, knowing he is responsible for so much misery and there is no happy future awaiting him with his friends."
Reasonable_Carob2534,bluedancepants,"Well I mean they do show bits and pieces here and there. Like when he met the boy he was going to crush and when Mikasa told Eren he was family. 

And then the final conversation he had with Armin and Mikasa. 

I think what they showed was enough. And there's enough mystery still left open to a possible sequel. Some have speculated that Eren isn't really dead. Who knows maybe it's all part of his plan."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Jerry98x,"I mean... it is not that we don't have info on his mental state, both before and after obtaining the full powers of the Founding Titan. Tha manga subtly tells you about it the whole time.

But yeah, I wish it was shown even more as well"
Reasonable_Carob2534,Strider_JRR,Facts!!! Real shit!!! Spit yo shit brother !!! 🗣️‼️‼️🔥💯💯
Reasonable_Carob2534,Virtual-Strike-1764,"In the same vein, I really wish season 4 began directly after s3 instead of starting 4 years in the future and showing us everything else later on in flashbacks"
Reasonable_Carob2534,Erenjaeger666_,"I agree, it would’ve been amazing to see his pov and feelings during the time skip, I think eren felt that hopelessness and turned himself away from everyone but was also desperate to find a solution to fix everything and also live to be with his friends and when he finally realizes that the outcome will always be the same no matter the thousands of solutions and end with his inevitable death so he’s like “fuck it I’ll just kill everyone at this point”"
Reasonable_Carob2534,A_LiftedLowRider,"If this type of concept fascinates you as much as it does me, you should read Dune.  Paul has a tremendous amount of similarity to timeskip Eren, especially after the first book.  And unlike AoT, that point of view and the psychology behind knowing such a thing at such a young age, is highly elaborated on.  For me, it really helped me see Eren’s point of view a lot better."
A_LiftedLowRider,Reasonable_Carob2534,I started it a year ago but dropped it. This comment makes me want to pick it up again though! I’m really interested in this type of psyche so I’m gonna go find my copy right now.
Reasonable_Carob2534,A_LiftedLowRider,"You definitely should.  I think you’ll find you have a new appreciation for it and its themes.  The whole of the first book is essentially everything Eren would have felt and thought during the time-skip.  I’ve been describing Eren’s situation as a “Paul dilemma” ever since the finale lol.  If you can get to God Emperor of Dune, it’s essentially Eren as The Founder from his point of view."
A_LiftedLowRider,cursed_melon,"While similar in a lot of cases, it's also very different. 

Personally I am not a fan of the ""I saw the future and couldn't change it"" troupe because it feels like a cop out, but in Eren's case it actually makes sense. He says he couldn't change the future, but that's only because he himself won't change or deviate from his own personal desires. In Paul's case, it is quite different but not in a good way in my opinion."
Reasonable_Carob2534,TruthSeekerHuey,Could have had a separate flashback showing his character before he reveals the truth of his plans to Armin in the last chapter
Reasonable_Carob2534,ErenMert21,Yup but the mystery was so good man. Thats why i also dont get why people wanted places outside of marley and paradies to be explored
Reasonable_Carob2534,KhadaJhIn12,I agree with everything you said exactly how you said it.
Reasonable_Carob2534,endar88,i would have at least been ok with a whole episode before the final episode (if it wasn't split as a movie) being a wrap up almost of the whole show through his eyes with the founding titan. seeing him first person trying to change things/calculate the decisions he made. or whether time was focused to always end this way or not. then the final episode he gets killed and all the post rumbling stuff.
Reasonable_Carob2534,None,You should read the first two Dune books
Reasonable_Carob2534,Greek-Ra,Yeah the reason you never saw it is because Isayama obviously didn’t know how to write it lol.
Greek-Ra,Reasonable_Carob2534,I will always have AO3 at least.
Reasonable_Carob2534,None,"Idk looking back in the series, and my own mental health, those jabs about him being a suicidal maniac seem more poignant

Exploring his mental health would’ve deterred what the story does imo."
None,Reasonable_Carob2534,I feel that myself. How would it have deterred what the story does though?
Reasonable_Carob2534,None,"Hmm maybe not deter, but I feel exploring his mental health would’ve dragged the story down (a bit)

He knows what has to be done, and is aware of all the pain and suffering he’s going to witness. So by the end we see him and we understand why he acts that way.

The mental aspect, would take away from that I feel"
Reasonable_Carob2534,joesica7,"I can appreciate ur opinion, but I have to disagree. I think that one of the most interesting aspects of (for me) watching the final moments of aot was trying to put myself in Eren’s shoes.

Coming to my own conclusions about his mental state rather than it being explained to me encouraged me to observe the series through a different lens.

Sometimes not showing/explaining something is better than doing so, think the ending of Rosemary’s Baby (if you’ve seen it)

Just my opinion tho, I can see why someone would want to know the inner working of Eren’s thoughts now that he was (essentially) omnipotent"
joesica7,Reasonable_Carob2534,"That’s fair. Thank you for responding! I’m split because I like that his mental state is hidden because it allows for more discussion and interpretations, but also I’m so curious, I wanna know!"
Reasonable_Carob2534,joesica7,"Tooooootally feel u in terms of being curious about what’s going on in his head. Just goes to show how insanely well put together this show is: there is no “right” answer concerning Eren’s mental state, which is both cool and infuriating lol"
Reasonable_Carob2534,ComfortableReason796,Just search NHK Eren interview
Reasonable_Carob2534,Reasonable_Carob2534,I feel like it could’ve contrasted the Alliance’s POV really well too. A group of humans POV and then an eldritch abomination with a human’s mind POV.
Reasonable_Carob2534,ForeverGray,Move forward. Kill them all. More death bring more freedom.
Reasonable_Carob2534,K-J-C,Dunno what do you think of Eren's goals and desires pre-founder if you think he died only because he chose to commit horrible atrocities in time skip?
K-J-C,Reasonable_Carob2534,idk i can only dedicate my head to one aspect of him at a time but what are your thoughts on it? i’ll probably have an answer in a week when i hyperfixate on a different aspect of him.
Reasonable_Carob2534,K-J-C,"I thought his goal, or at least one of it (as Eren has other wants like wanting to end the cycle in time skip), is just similar, Eren wants to experience the outside world he saw on the book. In the time skip, he's disappointed and wants to turn the world like what he saw on the book.

The action is the different one, pre-time skip he slaughters all Titans (his main obstacle to the outside world), in post-time skip he slaughters all living beings outside Paradis. Difference is that he now knows how's the outside world after time skip, thought he just wants to slaughter anything he deems an enemy, just that the target in pre-time skip is a deserving one of pure monsters."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Clean-Eagle-9002,He was the founder at 10 years old
Clean-Eagle-9002,Reasonable_Carob2534,"I meant when he gains the full powers of it during the Paths arc. I could’ve made it more clear, sorry."
Reasonable_Carob2534,bluedancepants,"Well I mean they do show bits and pieces here and there. Like when he met the boy he was going to crush and when Mikasa told Eren he was family. 

And then the final conversation he had with Armin and Mikasa. 

I think what they showed was enough. And there's enough mystery still left open to a possible sequel. Some have speculated that Eren isn't really dead. Who knows maybe it's all part of his plan."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Jurgrady,"I understand the perspective but the thing with this sort of stuff is that it usually isn't as interesting as it sounds. That kind of insight is how you end up with whiney characters that are annoying because we got two seasons of exposition on their feelings.


Way more impactful the way it was. It would change all kinds of stuff as well because a good amount of the plot for what we did get was giving us insight into those things. 


It's much better to question wtf he was doing, and then understand at the end, then to know the whole time and just be waiting for the other characters to get it. "
Reasonable_Carob2534,Jengasa,"When you have a very compelling character with an ominous vibe that gives you shivers down your spine every time they're on screen, it's always best to use them in moderation. 
Too much screen time can ruin the magic."

Reasonable_Carob2534,someloserontheground,Yeah it was a weird decision to timeskip and then take focus away from Eren to just watch the scouts keep doing the same thing they've been doing all show. They missed a big chance to *actually* shift direction in the show and do something new and interesting
Reasonable_Carob2534,Dry-Introduction-491,"Yah and this is exactly what I expected Final Chapters Pt 2 to address, which they did a little bit, but spent way more time on the romance of two characters whose interactions are closer to siblings than romantic partners 99% of the time."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Annihilator4413,"Idk I found him to be extremely boring after he turned into a maniac. I know part of it was to get his friends to hate him, knowing what he was going to do and being unable to change it for some weird fucking reason, but he just became completely uninteresting to me and I hate his entire character arc now."
Annihilator4413,Reasonable_Carob2534,"and that’s ok too! did you find him more interesting pre-s4? 
ironically I personally fell in love with the character in s4 for more reasons than I can list."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Annihilator4413,"I did find him more interesting pre-S4. Overall still love the show, just find how Erens story ended quite bitter."

What’s weird is when you can’t control your thoughts/instincts and act like rape is ok. It’s fine to think someone is sexy. The second you make them uncomfortable it’s weird. Any normal person can hold back their “urges” in order to be a properly functioning member of society.

Sapphocfem,GrooveMetalBruh,the projection's insane in the reply lol
Sapphocfem,GamerGuyThai,"I've actually been raped by two different women on the same day when I was 20 lol. I didn't know at the time it was rape, but I said no repeatedly to both. 

I don't have mental trauma over it, but guys have a hard time believing I was any kind of victim. It was a girl who crushed on me when we were kids. She was 18, I was 20. She actually molested me by trying to kiss me against my will when she was like 9 and I was 11. 

Our parents got into an unrelated argument and I wouldn't see them for nearly 10 years. Ran into her brother who used to be my best friend, caught up, and he invited me to her graduation, she stole my number from his phone and we had talked. She was really cute, I wanted to take things slow, but she wanted to fuck immediately. 

I said no, she questioned my sexuality and eventually coerced me after I declined 3x. I jokingly say a man can only say no to something he actually wants so many times, but I was just a kid. This is about a week after my breakup of a 5 year relationship and just exploring my 2nd relationship. I was weak there but when a beautiful 18 yo vietnamese girl begs to suck your dick for just 5 minutes, its incredibly hard to resist...and I did say no to that. I fell for the trap when she asked if I was gay. I let her feel over my jeans because obviously I was hard and that only empowered her. 

The second time happened after my ex called me that night saying she was going to kill herself. I still loved her at the time, we broke up and I made sure that we were going to go through with it prior, she immediately 180'd when she realized another girl was interested in me a week later. 

I show up at her house, no one is home, she greets me in her grandmothers wedding dress wreaking of cigarettes and preys on my feelings for her. Again I said no several times, she had said we were done and I had met with someone else, but my feelings for her hadn't changed, just included the sadness of us being over mixed with a new girl who was interested in me and hadn't wronged me yet. (At the time I didn't consider it rape, I wasn't educated on the subject). She was aware I came from the girl she worried about because my dumbass showed up with hickies, didn't think about it, didn't know I had them, let alone was going to get naked. I just didn't want her to kill herself.  

I asked her repeatedly if she was sure when we originally met to break up and I cried sitting at a picnic table and told her this would be a mistake, that we loved each other, but she made her choice and I went home. Now she was trying to win me back. Anyway, we did smash all night in her parent's bedroom, I was still in love with her at the time, regretfully, I was weak and not over her yet. 

All this to say, women 100% have urges just as unsightly as men, they just hide it better and are less able to enforce, but are often experts at coercion. Other than that, chick's grab at my crotch randomly in my bar scene days, way more bold than what most guys are doing in their early 20s. I chalk that up to western women being curious about Asian dick size but still majorly inappropriate. Never did anything about it. 

For the record, I'm not some Greek God or something, I'm legit 5'5(6 on a good day lol) Viet Amerasian dude from Western NY but I have been told I'm handsome...and I was pretty active and fit."

as much as I don't like Mikasa, she deserved so much better then eren."
Osaka-enjoyer,Useful-Activity-4295,"That's the entire point though. Eren is a reckless and selfish person who should not have had such power in the first place he used everyone in the prusuit of his dream while telling himself it was all for there sake, the yeagarists not only showcase the dangers of extreamism but also the dangers of what is called the ""cult of name"". They worshiped eren as their god and savior while he didn't care and had his own agenda, as long as armin and mikasa were safe that's all that matters and when he gained the power of the founder he saw the entire futur and knew thoses two would survive, paradis can burn for all he cares"
Osaka-enjoyer,FlowerFaerie13,Mate he was on his way to murder 80% of the goddamn planet do you really think he gave a fuck about what Floch was doing.
FlowerFaerie13,Osaka-enjoyer,"but the problem with that, is that his ""worshipers"" were fighting his friends including mikasa to the DEATH, him not caring put his friends in more danger and all for no reason, since he never cared, and even worse, is that his people ARE NEVER going to even attempt peace with the rest of the world, since HE is the one who galvanized them, and instead of using his powers to take their nationalistic memories away, he left them rabid fascists.

its shown in the final chapter, that the eldians don't even want peace themselves, and this is all of because eren NOT CARING , and yet he apparently cared enough to wipe out MILLIONS of innocent people, ngl it seems like eren can't decide if he cares or not"

Osaka-enjoyer,brogrammer1992,"Does it annoy me? Sure the whole rumbling motivation does.

Osaka-enjoyer,ErenMert21,But didnt Floch do his own thing and Eren was already on his way to get founder powers? Did he even know?
ErenMert21,Osaka-enjoyer,"eren could tell where all eldians were and communicate to them, eren should have told his followers to stand down, so his friends wouldn't be in more danger fighting them to the death.

of course its more than possible that they don't listen, but eren could have at least tried."

baddreemurr,TotalBlueXL,like a 99% thats a shitpost
baddreemurr,SonnySunshiny,people will see parallels and metaphor and take it extremely literally
Odd_Appearance7123,Rainy_Wavey,"Eren and King Fritz shares similarities (mad king who lost their mind and has ultimate power who wanna impose their will) but also dissimilarities (Eren is actually a good person that ultimately crumbled beneath his own absolute power, at the very least, he still harbored humane feelings up until his demise, can't say the same about Fritz)"
Rainy_Wavey,GigarandomNoodle,Not to mention the whole ymir and mikasa parallels…
GigarandomNoodle,Lucky_Roberts,Not sure how well that particular comparison holds up to scrutiny
GigarandomNoodle,Rainy_Wavey,"Ymir/Mikasa parallel is imo pretty weak and reeks of late-run course correction, the two characters are completely opposite, Mikasa is supposedly a slave to her love to Eren but the manga sure only makes that a thing in the later chapters to ""force"" that parallel, the only parallel both have is being in love with a mad king BUT.

Ymir was, for lack of a better word, broken and abused by a shit piece of shit who exploited her for her entire life, giving her no time of respise, and yes i know she ends up dying for King Fritz, but it was out of her love for her children, even if conceived non-consensually and by a piece of shit (i am uncomfortable with this tbh)

Mikasa's only mistake is being in love with a guy who never reciprocated, but at no point is she being shown being exploited by Eren, not only is Mikasa one of the, if not the strongest soldier of humanity, she takes on game-ending threats and actually powers through it, she is strong, resolute, has a sensible head on her shoulders, motivates Eren after the death of their parents....etc Eren never ever physically abused of Mikasa, except if you count the time he accidentally hurt her in the first season (and he deeply regretted that). This parallel imo is the weakest part of an otherwise pretty good ending, it being Canon doesn't forgive bad writing."
Rainy_Wavey,TYNAMITE14,"Wait wait hold on, the parallel might be intentional. Like maybe isayama was saying that regardless of erens good intentions, he's still as bad if not worse than king fritz, whome we'd all agree is pretty bad."
TYNAMITE14,Rainy_Wavey,"Yes that's the parallel, they both are mad kings who commit genocides, a parallel does not mean that both characters are carbon copy, it means that both characters share some elements that can be put in parallel."
Rainy_Wavey,Snarpkingguy,"Eren is not a “good person”, he’s sympathetic."
Snarpkingguy,Rainy_Wavey,"At some point of his life he was, he selflessly gave up his life to save Armin (he didn't know he was a Titan), and didn't hesitate to defend his friends, him being consumed by hatred is sad but that doesn't cancel the moments he was geniunely good."
Odd_Appearance7123,TheUsrTheUsr,"I like how this can actually be a good parallel to analyze but they take it to the most unhinged interpretation lol 

Like you can see it as how one’s rampant selfish desires enslave them so much that their drive hurts the one’s they “love” around them. 
- Eren drive for freedom hurts Grisha and his friends that want to reel him back from insanity 
- Fritz drive for domination hurts Ymir and their kids"

So basically in the end the rumbling does happen as planned and our gang does stop but Eren doesn’t die (everyone thinks he does tho), Eren somehow ends up obtaining all of the titan shifters' powers due to which he breaks the 13-year titan shifter curse. Instead he cannot technically die though ages veryyyy slowly. As a result, he lives for another 2000 plus years in hiding (doesn’t wanna deal w the drama of committing genocide and what not) during which he sees the world develop and get destroyed (etc. apocalypse then redevelopment which is shown in the extra chapters and the end of the anime) and 2000 YEARS LATER…Erens loses all hold of what remaining sanity he had to the point where he becomes the original king Fritz that Ymir falls in love with. Basically history then repeats itself literally which means that Eren has always been in this time loop from the very beginning. This also explains the episode titles TO YOU, 2000 YEARS AGO and FROM YOU, 2000 YEARS LATER and why Ymir falls in love with Fritz and breaks the curse ONLY for Eren (she subconsciously knew it was the same person or something)."

If so i never caught it, I just thought Ymir tried running away, fell in a tree that gave her powers and the king seen that and wanted to use her to fight his battles. In doing so he will be her love and give Ymir a family. Something that a lot of the slaves around her could never have."
EZ4SLEEZY,Aromatic_Building_76,"You can’t give love to a little girl that way and since she died as a child that means he did in fact rape her, and when she died he did have his daughters eat her fresh corpse in order to ensure that they inherited her power."

So they must also thing that king Fritz wrapped the scarf around Mikasa, since they surely think Eren got reincarnated into a bird"
Jerry98x,czareena,"Idk I used to hate the bird thing but after the last song was released called to you in 2000 or 20,000 years, I feel like eren might be stuck in paths instead of Ymir now, so he can see out of all eyes of life- if that makes any sense? 

Or maybe I’m reading too much into it???"
czareena,Jerry98x,The Paths have crumbled as soon as Ymir was conpletely freed and she could rest in peace. Patgs don't exist anymore
Odd_Appearance7123,muskian,"All it'd take to not invite the comparison would be for Eren to not become trash. There's aleady a huge problem in even approaching the same ballpark as the First King, and Eren dives right into it with his stoking of supremacist militias alone."

Megashark101,PhunkOperator,Same people that were wondering why private businesses were allowed to refuse them service for not wearing a mask during the pandemic.
Megashark101,Acceptable_Oven_9881,"'Free speech' bitches don't know what that means.

Sure the constitution gives you the right to say your thoughts. BUT it doesn't protect you from potential consequences. I can hop on a phone call with Putin and sell him some military secrets. That is free speech. It's my right. But it's also fucking treason.

Those anti-maskers made no sense because choosing to not wear a mask has nothing to do with free speech. They just chose to disobey laws that even though they were uncomfortable, still helped people. And when they were called out for it, they ran to 'free speech.'

Same thing here. By creating an account with Reddit, you agreed with the terms and conditions even though most of them never read it. Criticizing the ending is fine. Spreading misinformation about how Isayama is being brainwashed by liberals or people from Israel isn't.

They just want to claim a non-existent high ground."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,Jin_Bong_Kyo,"Free speech does not allow hate speech.

Also, Reddit servers are technically private property. One cannot go onto someone's property and start shouting racist slurs. The owner of that property has the right to kick them off."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,None,"I guess they complain about it because Reddit was founded on free speech principles, you could say the most depraved shit and they wouldn't ban you (unless you broke laws) because they believed in free speech. Of course once they started getting corporate they limited it. And it's just a sad reminder seeing subs like this getting banned (even though Yeagerbomb had it coming because of the TOS breaks)"
Acceptable_Oven_9881,Samvel_2015,"What is the meaning of free speech then? You can say what you want and face consequences even if there is not officially any freedom of speech.

Now i don't say this retards should be let to say shit like in the post, but whatsoever where is the free speech part then?"

I don't mind the people who are actually understanding and give constructive critisism about the ending. I like reading those and realising the mistakes in the ending."
TheZynec,Big_Yase,"I was thinking the same thing myself, if you dont like the ending cos it felt rushed and clumsy I can understand (hopefully yams can iron out the wrinkles in the anime), but if someone thinks the ending ruins the rest of the impeccable story, I think they just lacks the maturity or emotional intelligence to think empathetically, and determine the better of two evils.

This is just using anecdotes, but everyone I’ve met irl that said they hated the ending of AoT has either had a room temperature iq, been immature to the point of naïveté or just been a straight up racist, authoritarian Floch stan. Someone who can’t forgive Reiner and Annie, calls Mikasa ‘Dogkasa’, and think that Erens confession of his feelings for Mikasa to Armin in the paths was a betrayal of his character, when he’s always been like that from the start, they’ve  just been to thick to see through his front. 

People like this only get any kind of validation online and in real life they are the scum of the earth, which is a good thing. The way I see it all of the yeagerbomb guys are just incels going through a phase, and ideally they’ll break out when they meet more people and experience the real world outside of their school (cos of course they’re all in high school), and cringe at how they were. When you take the core message from AoT, you understand these guys are obviously just hurting from something to be able to spread hatred like they do, and they have room to get better"

""But Mikasa could have been happy alone"". Yeah I don't buy it. No sane person wants to spend their entire life alone. Especially not a 19 year old girl who has her whole life ahead of her."
reasonable00,None,"Well no, it’s possible to have people not wanting romantic relationships, but that’s just not Mikasa’s character. Her whole thing is wanting a family."
None,QueenHistoria1990,"But not just with anyone. What she wanted more than anything was to have a family with Eren, the one she showed her clan tattoo (supposed to pass it on to her kids) and upon whose tombstone she wrote the words “my most beloved, my dear” (anata in Japanese is used by wives for their husbands).

She sacrificed what she wanted most, mourned him for years, and then moved on - one way or another - but not completely. We still see her continuously visiting his grave even with her NPC man/child. 

Anyway, the point of her epilogue is to show she never stopped loving Eren but still managed to live a good life. She died an old lady, still wearing his scarf. He was her “family” (home to return to). She told Armin in S2 “all I want is to be by his side”. 

Luckily, she has me so she’ll never be lonely. 😚"

Godi22kam,MorningMaterial1143,At that point in the story what is there for a fan to gain from her not being married

Godi22kam,QueenHistoria1990,"Or just wanted to share her personal opinion/interpretation of an ambiguous ending.

Read the first part, she makes it clear and is very respectful. And people are responding horribly like immature weirdos harassing her rather just ignoring, respectfully disagreeing, or arguing the points made. Sheesh why are so many triggered by this topic?

If you believe Mikasa married someone (she did, me btw) you’re not bad for thinking that. And if you believe Mikasa stayed single and adopted a child, that’s fine too.

Let people have their own opinions, it’s not that difficult lol"
QueenHistoria1990,himank957,if only people could understand that neither interpretation is canon. you believe what you want to that's why its left ambiguous
himank957,QueenHistoria1990,Exactly!!
QueenHistoria1990,No-Trash-6356,EXACTLYYY!! That’s why some people in the AOT fandom is so annoying. They can’t take opinions for the life of them😭
Godi22kam,sunset-cloud12,"Idk, I personally buy the idea that Mikasa married neither Armin or Jean, they were with her during all the journey and will be understanding of her feelings and truly care for her, also for the best friendships it develops the deepest of love, also trauma bond.

Godi22kam,None,Funniest thing is when people start bringing up the storyboards or some lyrics from an ED. You already lost the argument if you gotta bring up something external to the actual anime
Godi22kam,brownguy0_0,"Just like yall deluded over the fact she’s married there are some deluded over the fact she isn’t. The fact isn’t confirmed so none of yall are right.

Stop acting like you guys are better than those people. This fact is left open to interpretation and if you think she does get married based on your logic then good.
Doesn’t make the opposite side wrong.

ErenMert21,Responsible-Pin7827,Don't worry story board already debunked all this husband theorys🤣🤣🤣
Godi22kam,Responsible-Pin7827,Don't worry there is no need of clue anymore . Story board of extra pages released with blue ray already has given us enough clues. She remained loyal to eren. Plus these two were just random couples not mikasa or her husband. If this women would be mikasa then story board would've stated it just like other sscenes. This couple was just reffered as random people.
Godi22kam,None,"No other dude can gain the respect and love from mikasa like eren could. The white flowers, the engraved markings on the tombstone. Too much for her to just pick a random bozo in the verse. She died a virgin and single. She wanted a family but only with eren. Yall can stop coping. That’s a purity ring. Yall are deluded"
Godi22kam,UsoppKing100,I just know it wasn't Jean. I could not care less otherwise
Sapphocfem,average_throwaway12,I think the op meant that he didn’t flirt or try and pursue a relationship with her but worded it VERY wrongly. “Force himself” was not the choice of words to use for what he meant.
average_throwaway12,average_throwaway12,Nvm read the bottom text.
average_throwaway12,Sapphocfem,Yeah OP doubled down on that aspect
average_throwaway12,turtleProphet,"Even the bottom text just reads like ESL lol

""Control themselves"" is a weird choice of words but they're pretty transparently saying it's hard to have a crush and choose not to pursue a relationship/get their attention.

Low bar yeah but you really have to reach to think this is implying SA."
average_throwaway12,tallllywacker,No he didn’t. Stop being fuckinf stupid.
Sapphocfem,ChaosKeeshond,God I hope that's a language barrier
ChaosKeeshond,TheOneWasTaken,It's not ☹️
Sapphocfem,Wild-Mushroom2404,"I mean, if we’re talking about anime, the bar is VERY low. The fact that Jean only complimented Mikasa’s hair in a very innocent manner once and never made even the slightest of moves later because he respected Eren and Mikasa is still important. He didn’t need to SA anyone, he could’ve just tried asking her out or trying to always insert himself into interactions with her but we don’t see that. He just admires Mikasa and cares about her from afar. 

And yet some people still say that he’s a simp and a stalker💀💀💀"
Wild-Mushroom2404,Dr-Oktavius,How can anyone watch the show or read the manga and come to the conclusion that Jean was a simp dawg I legitimately can't with these people like can you actually just not even like people anymore?
Dr-Oktavius,IngotSilverS550,Bro because a lot of anime mfs have no social skills lmao
Dr-Oktavius,K-J-C,"Liking someone but not being reciprocated seems to be just easy harassing target like Jean.

Cuz ""loser"" for being one-sided or such."
Wild-Mushroom2404,alexeiij,"in the terms of the grand scheme of anime, he's very much out of the ordinary. another reason why he's one of my favorites"
Wild-Mushroom2404,awesomlyawesome,"Which is wild. Bro handles his attraction in a way that would've had me oblivious myself if he was attracted to me 😂 there is no simping involved. Hell if I recall correctly in all that time we've seen him he really only complimented her hair, and later on dreamed about a life with a family including her. Compared to Reiner who literally reveres Historia as a goddess simply if the light hits her right, even after aiding in the destruction of Paradis, and sniffs the paper she writes on (the likes of which *Jean* even commented on lol!)"
awesomlyawesome,Wild-Mushroom2404,"I'm pretty sure Mikasa isn't aware of his feelings at all. Tbf, Reiner revered Historia only in his head, so thinking ""gotta marry her"" is about as same as Jean imagining his future life with Mikasa. But bro would NEVER sniff a letter like that, he has dignity"
Wild-Mushroom2404,Sapphocfem,Respecting anyone is the norm. Does he need to be congratulated for doing the bare minimum?
Sapphocfem,TheMrIllusion,"In the context of anime, yes. Sexual harassment is a norm as an anime trope."
Sapphocfem,Wild-Mushroom2404,"Not congratulated of course. But as I said, in the context of anime medium and how much creepiness there is, this is good. Other than that, I usually don’t bring it up until people say he simps for Mikasa smh."
Sapphocfem,StephensHouse,Yes. Being respectful is commendable.
Sapphocfem,None,i mean in anime and real life ofc it is commendable but the comment below is chronically online

Sapphocfem,joemama____________,"I think they meant that he didn’t try hitting on her, but even that is stupid to say since it’s not a bad thing to try and get with someone you’re interested in. As long as you maintain boundaries and act respectful, flirting isn’t a bad thing. It’s not like Mikasa explicitly denied him, though we know she likely wouldn’t have been interested just off her perceived character."
Sapphocfem,SuccessfulJob,oop is stupid and op you’re even estupider
Sapphocfem,lordmaster13,i'M PRETTY SURE NO ONE SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR NOT BEING A RAPIST

Sapphocfem,GabeDaBaby,Convinced the people in this thread are genuinely lacking social ability. They meant forcing as forcing conversations or interactions. How hard is it to understand that?
Sapphocfem,ThatOneOakTree,Not at all. It's the bare minimum. I'm not gonna praise someone for being a decent human being.
Sapphocfem,DeltaAlphaGulf,I mean given the poor wording it’s not entirely clear there is anything off about what they were meaning to say there. Definitely needed clarification though.

I'd rather spend time with my Pals Wrecking some video games, or chilling out.
If life wants me to meet someone, it'll happen.

Even then, Intimacy and Love to me is Frivolous, and a means of Preservation.
The last time I ever complimented a Female, just straight up thought she was Stunning.
Brown hair, Crystal Blue eyes, are an absolute killer for me.

She threatened me with Mace, while screaming like I was killing her.
I just walked away in Absolute depression."

Sapphocfem,Orange_TG5,“How many guys can keep a safe distance from the one they love” I did it so well that none of my classmates even realized I liked anyone because I distanced myself from everyone all at once it’s easier to go through Highschool without any friends because you don’t have to worry about anyone stabbing you in the back if you keep everyone at arms length although it’s not the best for ones mental health and I’ve since stopped that habit although I do sometimes slip back into it
Sapphocfem,None,"This is the nastiest self report I've ever seen, my dude it is not hard to sexually assault your crush wtf was mans on about?????"
Sapphocfem,None,I don’t think the person in your post is referring to sexual assault. I think they are more talking about flirting and expressing the feelings in untimely fashion especially because they had more important things going on at the time

Sapphocfem,TheGreenMouse77,"This is why radfem bullshit only serves to make women lower their standards. Because there's no way you would think this was commendable unless you think ""males"" are all rapists."
TheGreenMouse77,None,You do know most legitimate radfems practice separatism instead of lowering their standards? They just comment on men as they witness them speak and act.
None,TheGreenMouse77,"Even if that was true, which I doubt because there are a surprising amount of straight radfems with male partners (seriously, I see more sapphic and asexual women in the kind of queer spaces that radfems hate), women outside of radfem spaces see this kind of rhetoric, and stuff like this isn't going to make them read Dworkin or whoever it's just going to make them think their loser boyfriend is a keeper because he's not a rapist or an abuser."

Sapphocfem,funnies7407,Shoudnt that be… normal?
Sapphocfem,PauseTop974,It’s amazing what being told “I don’t rly like you that way” did for me when I thought a girl was sending me signals for like 10 years. I moved on pretty easily honestly. Some girls don’t openly say that. And I never forced myself but I did hint and I think ultimately annoyed her which I didn’t realize I was doing the whole time. Lesson learned: Communication is a two way street.

because a guy who shows interest in a girl is sexual harassment!

But if you don't show interest,
you're a gentleman ( like it matters because you'll still be single)

What a stupid take.

Eren could give a fuck less about Mikasa.

Jean should have pursued her... not like a perv.

Like lock eyes,
smile at her.
If she smiles back, approach her.

If not. 
Make a circle with your left hand and finger with your right.
If she laughs...approach.

But seriously....Not everything is toxic... goddammit"

It start with catching Hollows, huge prison break, then garrison time, then another reckless rescue which led to a large battle, then peaceful time with thriller from the enemy and lastly, a grand battle for the corpse emperor.

For filler, it is investigation and goose chase then   dealing a conspiracy, and dealing a huge mutiny and lastly a clone battle with Kon being Max Payne.

mr-harajuku,That-guy200,Erwin would probably push for peace and understanding with the outside world similar to Armin but I think Erwin would be much more influential.  It would be really interesting but maybe Erwin would have Paradise split on how to deal with the outside world and Eren would have to lead a smaller faction of yeagerists.  It could spark a civil war between Erwin’s scouts and Eren’s Yeagerists.  It would be a very interesting story to cover

PinkPrincessPol,BomanSteel,"Unlike Erwin, Armin didn't have a major position, he was a soldier, Erwin was a commander. 
Also, he kinda did. Armin just did what Hange and the military told him after he saw the sea. In seasons 1-3 Armin was pulling out master strategies."

Sure buddy, sure. You can keep crying about it how much you want, but Erwin would have never agreed with Eren's plan. That's damn sure.

Oh, and Eren is possibly the best written character in the story, especially after the ending. Top 3 for sure!"
mr-harajuku,OpheliaGingerWolfe,He would be more Reiner than Reiner.
mr-harajuku,zombiepants7,"If Armin or Mikasa died I think Eren would go fucking bonkers. Erwin would obviously have been better for humanity at that point. However I really wonder if with Eren doing what he does how that affects things. There's a huge chance Eren still attempts to complete the rumbling. There's also a huge chance without Armin around the Titan shifters don't come together to stop Eren and it's successful. 

Humanity didn't really stop the titans tbr. Titan shifters did. I think Armin has a lot more influence among that group than Erwin ever could have gained. I don't even know if Mikasa has it in her to fight Eren without Armin kind of confirming that it's the right thing to do."

mr-harajuku,Leaded-BabyFormula,"There would've been no time skip. It'd take a year for Erwin to have enough information about Marley and their current conflict.

mr-harajuku,None,"Erwin’s goal was always to protect humanity and prove his father right. I think to him humanity meant the people inside the walls, even though he suspected since childhood that there were people outside of the walls as well. I don’t think he would have seen the people of the world any differently than titans. He may not have agreed with genocide, and he certainly wasn’t new to using people as chess pieces when necessary, so maybe he would’ve supported having Historia pass down the Beast Titan. I think if it came to it though, he might’ve sided with Eren if Eren shared his knowledge with him. As bad as it was, the rumbling is what led to getting rid of the Titans and keeping the world from attacking Paradis, and I think to Erwin humanity meant specifically those on the island. Erwin has used innocent people before, like when they trapped the Female Titan."

mr-harajuku,JPastori,"I think he’d go with erens plan seeing how Marley plans to attack regardless. He was a very “the ends justify the means” kinda guy. 

He was more than willing to sacrifice lives to accomplish what he sees as the greater good. I mean to capture Annie he was willing to flatten a city. If he knew the options were to completely destroy the enemy’s military or risk the destruction of everyone in the walls, I think he would’ve been fully on board."
JPastori,Warm_starlight,">If he knew the options were to completely destroy the enemy’s military or risk the destruction of everyone in the walls, I think he would’ve been fully on board.

Except just destroying the military was not Eren's intention. His intention was to Wipe out Everyone outside the walls."
Warm_starlight,JPastori,"I mean, I don’t personally think he would’ve agreed with the full genocide, but I could also see an argument for why he would. 

I mean he was not afraid to sacrifice lives to accomplish whatever the mission may have been, civilian or military, if needed. If he felt the world would’ve still been bent on wiping out paradise I can see him going along with erens plan."
JPastori,Warm_starlight,">He was more than willing to sacrifice lives to accomplish what he sees as the greater good.

Considering his moto was ""give your heart to humanity"" the greater good would be  to let all Eldians die out and the rest of humanity live. He would support Zeke's plan in that case."
Warm_starlight,JPastori,"I don’t think so, remember he said that thinking humanity was solely those who reside in the walls. In his mind there were no other humans, at least no concrete evidence of large populations outside the walls. 

At the end of the day I think he’d do whatever was needed to protect his people, rather than a bunch of other people who have been trying to exterminate the eldians."
mr-harajuku,bluedancepants,He would join Eren and make Marley go boom.

Idk honestly, I wish the ending was different because I wanted a smarter solution than what we got. But at the same time the ending represents perfectly the cycle of violence, that it won’t end until everyone is dead. Maybe it’s a part of human nature that we can’t escape. We live in a cruel world."

Ymir's freeing was the only act that could end the power of the titans, and Eren, while not directly influenced by her, was definitely manipulated to help her in that regard. It sounds completely insane, and this wasn't even Eren's original motivation, but if events hadn't gone the exact way they did Mikasa wouldn't have killed Eren and freed ymir. While Eren could've possibly used his knowledge to do things differently, he was limited by his personal feelings. The outcome he chose let him follow his selfish desires and save most of his friends, it had to happen the way it happened because Eren was flawed and should never have been god. At the same time, it's Eren's personality and flaws that allowed him to present himself as similar to the First King, and ultimately the power of the titans was fixed through the relationship of two people. There is no way for the founder to fix anything on their own because ultimate power lies with Ymir"
Chimkimnuggets,Ben13DK,How would a small scale rumbling even work? You would still crush many people with the titans just to get to the military bases
Chimkimnuggets,gbro666,"So basically. They nuke a couple locations using weapons that basically have their insignia on it. And then they shoot themselves in the foot by getting rid of the only reason no one ever invaded. Like everyone said everyone already hates Eldians(even Eldians hate themselves).
""Oh I already hate you to the point that I actively want to kill you. Wait you got rid of the only thing stopping me from attacking? Sounds like free real estate!""

Also lets not forget about the island itself. Show told us multiple times that the island has resources that everyone wants, why wouldn't they attack ever(like they did in the end once they rebuilt their army)."
Applitude,CCVork,"> it won’t end until everyone is dead.

Or, the real solution being if it ends if people choose to let go of hatred. We saw it happen with Sasha's parents and Kenny, among others. The ending is left open ended precisely to send the message that the future is in our hands, whether the cycle continues or ends.

It's really sobering that ending cycle of hate via letting go is so ""impossible"" that people automatically forget it's a solution at all and would sooner count on ""everyone dead"" as the only ""solution"". It's the same with Armin's ""talk with the enemy"" that is so often scoffed as naive and impossible, that people are shamed for even wanting to try."
CCVork,None,"\> It's really sobering that ending cycle of hate via letting go is so ""impossible"" that people automatically forget it's a solution at all and would sooner count on ""everyone dead"" as the only ""solution"". 

  
I mean it just reflects reality, obviously after thousands and thousands of years humanity has failed at achieving world peace so why would it be any different in the world of AoT?"
CCVork,Applitude,"I agree with you that people need to rise above the cycle and be brave enough to let go of hate/fear. I left it out for two reasons, I didn’t want to go on too long and I was thinking about the intro montage in season two that shows pairs of animals fighting and being eaten. Each animal, acting in its own self interest needs to kill in order to live (even herbivores out compete others or evade predators resulting in the others’ deaths). That’s the nature of our world, that life causes death (and in Eren’s case, to be free is to be the strongest) and somehow humans need to rise above that nature. Even if humans are able to rise above for a time there is no guarantee that future people won’t fail to do so. Because people die and are replaced it’s easy to fall into the same traps others did before them. It takes an insane amount of courage to break the cycle, knowing what will happen to you if the other side doesn’t meet you halfway.

I see the Titans as clear symbolism for a super weapon similar to nukes. As long as they exist, it’s impossible to trust. The creators must’ve drawn the same conclusion and that explains the ending montage of the world advancing until everyone gets wiped out by long range missiles. With humans in particular, we become more powerful than evolution ever could have made us, with this comes a ratcheting of tensions until a breaking point.

If you think this is so far fetched or that humanity is too enlightened now to destroy itself, just look at the world around us. The biggest part of the budget in the US is military. It is the same in all of the largest countries. Around the world people are getting more angry and more fearful. Our descendants are waiting in the wings, holding their breaths on the decisions we make today. Will we be able to make the right choice this time? Or will we fail again like countless times before? 

I want to believe we can do it. That is my faith in humanity, that we can truly overcome our nature one day. I believe in that boy and his dog.

And now I’ve gone and ranted lol. My bad lol"
CCVork,BeyondStars_ThenMore,"I would agree, if it wasn't for that damnable extra ending where we see the future, and the wars it brings. Because suddenly we knows the cycle continuing is inevitable, which is apparently what the author was going for. Personally, i believe the last part of the story we see should have been a meeting between people of Paradise (including Armin) and leaders of surviving nations, and then left it open whether they achieve peace."
Applitude,THE_PENILE_TITAN,"> I mean he did say that was his reasoning (I think, it’s been a while since I saw the end. Also is it different in the manga?) But you could also say that he left the choice up to them whether to save the rest of the world or not. Maybe both outcomes were acceptable?

I think it's a bit clearer in the manga that he was mostly lying to himself and others because he was unwilling to accept that he was doing the Rumbling mostly for his own psychotic need for freedom as he tells Ramzi in chapter 131. Reading the manga, it's probably easier to stop and think about what Eren is saying and doing at certain times rather than simply thinking he's just flustered, confused, or self-righteous."
Applitude,SlowUrRoill,"The cycle is the point, there is no way to stop the cycle of violence because everyone will go through something that pushed and enforces their ideology which will in turn cause more violence"
Applitude,Accomplished-Aerie65,"I actually don't mind the ending in terms of what happens to paradis, because there obviously was lasting peace for centuries after the rumbling, most likely caused by diplomacy between his friends. I don't understand people who wanted paradis to stand forever, I do think it's a little weird to randomly show far into the future in the final few pages but it adds to the overall sense of futility the ending creates. Eren becomes god and still can't end the cycle of violence, his only small victory is that he ensures most of his friends survive and live the lives he wanted for them. While it definitely doesn't feel 'worth it' to us, I still like it better than other potential endings."
Applitude,Candycanes02,"I think people can have multiple avenues for rationalizing their actions. I think part of Eren did want to protect his friends (though he also thinks he just thought this to feel better about himself, because his actions ended up killing Hange, Sasha and Floch), another part just wanted to make everyone disappear to fulfill his dream of seeing the outside world that doesn’t have humans in it, and yet another reason is that he was driven to madness by the hatred he felt against the non-Paradisians."
Applitude,Resident_Nose_2467,"It would have been better if Eren had to destroy his friends to win, and thus become a demon. Because 'if you are not willing to sacrifice everything you won't change anything' theme, it would e nice that Erens inability to kill his friends is the reason of his doom"

Someone posted an awesome meme cartoon 'oh yeah he's just like me!'  /  'oh no, he's just like me!' which speaks volumes"
j4ckbauer,BingusSpingus,"I've become so much like Eren Jaeger, it's scary.

I wear black cardigans, verbally assault women, and physically assault my friends. When I look in the mirror, I can't help but say ""戦い, 戦い"" (which means fight, fight in american.) I grew my hair out long because I don't care so now I have to wear it in a bun and I don't care what people think so shut fuck up Hange! I always leave an open wound on my hand, and go out of my way to show it to everyone so they are reminded that I am in control. When I see dogs being taken on walks I get mad at them for not being free like I am. I can't have sex with my girlfriend anymore without forcing her to dress up as Mikasa or Historia, both of whom remind me of Armin. When I order fast food, I refuse to call them french fries and insist on calling them freedom fries. I just keep moving forward, until my enemies are destroyed."
j4ckbauer,Syko_Alien,"wth are you talking about? i didn't say ""oh yeah he's just like me!"". i will say Eren Yeager had the same motivation and end goal from the start of the series to the end. to kill ever last one of them."
j4ckbauer,Hari14032001,"I didn't like that he went down saying ""I don't know why I did it"". He could've said any other reason (dissatisfied with the outside world, permanently protecting his island, getting revenge etc).

He is young yes, but he saw enough shit to develop some conviction. But he didn't show any while answering Armin. You would think that such a massive decision would require a ton of conviction.

Part of the reason why Eren's mindset was vague was because of that whole Ymir plotline which made it confusing about who was really in control and to what extent things were predetermined. Till date, I can't wrap my head around how much agency Eren even had. Imo, the Ymir's toxic love plotline was an unnecessary addition that only caused confusion and took away the focus from the other important themes of the plot.

I am not a fan of such lack of clarity in the end for an otherwise great story with wonderfully handled plot points and foreshadowing."

Syko_Alien,HistoriaReiss1,"I did pay attention, watched a whole lotta theories and explanations of it too. And while I get the theme it was trying to potray, the ending was undeniably rushed. (Aot is one of my top favs)

To put it simply, the ending insisted upon itself."
HistoriaReiss1,Syko_Alien,I'll deny that it was rushed. A story doesn't need to be dragged out to be complete. We don't need every nuance of information to be satisfied. Heck. It's better to not. Now we get to pick apart all the little bits and formulate our own theories. The writers work is done and we get to have fun.
Syko_Alien,nagibaThor228,"You do realise that ""he tried to make his friends heroes, his s4 persona was an act"" is what ending defenders say, right?"
nagibaThor228,Syko_Alien,Untrue. I am an ending defender and I do not say that. Neither does many people i know who have watched the show and read the manga.

None,Login_Lost_Horizon,"Because it was, in fact, mostly an act. Not entirely, but mostly. He gave them freedom not because he was trying to rationalize, he was trying to get Mikasa to kill him right after the God Under Tree gets detached of him to finish all the titans. Yall ""he was genocidel"" guys wearing your reading comprehention cap tend somehow to forget one of the biggest f....g points about Eren specifically not wanting to continue the cycle of cannibalism."

Human_Competition883,Tiny-Air-1925,genocide is a big dumb idiotic action. there's no genocide in history where that isn't the case.
Tiny-Air-1925,Human_Competition883,"A true statement. 

But from a narrative standpoint im left unfulfilled. “I was just being an idiot” is not a satisfying explanation IMO. "
Tiny-Air-1925,Hari14032001,"It's dumb yes, but you would expect the culprit to give a reason with conviction instead of saying ""I'm an idiot or I don't know why I did it""."
Tiny-Air-1925,azmarteal,"Nope. Genocide is a horrible thing from a morale point, but it isn't idiotic. US immigrants genocided native americans not just because ""they were dumb idiots"" - but to create a country for themselves. And they were quite efficient in it."

nan,Bulky_Bandicoot_2372,"Eren definitely was the bad guy, but the way I understood it when he explained it, too, Armin, he kinda had no choice at that point he could see the past, present, and future and no matter what he tried to do he couldn't change it, so when he first started everything he prolly did want to kill everyone and was lashing out in anger, but then when he realized he couldn't stop he did his best to make it less bad, but even so 80% is pretty gnarly so I would say it's a bit of both at first Selfish anger than frantically trying to save it without really being able too."
nan,Kyleb791,"I always saw his reasoning like Reiner. A mess.

His true inner reasons where why he was born. To be free and also to get revenge.

But he convinced himself to be for heroic reasons because he has grown alongside a survey corps who earns to fight for humanity. He like Reiner got way too into the Survey Corps.

Of course near the end and especially when Armin confronted him. Or even with Ramzi. He knew about his true intentions, and he both hated it (because of his learned side to be good a righteous soldier), and loved it (because that’s who he is).

These sides also came into conflict with his friends. He truly wanted to complete destroying the world, but there was that side of him that wanted them to live and beat him. Which is how they even beat him. These are contradictory, which is why Eren says he doesn’t know if they’d live or not. And why he doesn’t stop his plan after Sasha dies. He was gambling basically."
nan,AdMinute1130,"Idk I feel like both of these are too extreme. To me it seemed he didn't know what else to do, I mean he even stated himself im pretty sure that he was just an idiot who got ahold of power.

He wasn't some mad tyrannical genocidal maniac, and he wasn't some galaxy brained genius setting up a master plan. He was just a child soldier with PTSD who was told by the world that his family and everyone he loves would be killed unless he did something to stop it.

So he did. I don't view him as a hero, more like a sympathetic villain. He didn't have a choice. He spent years being told to trust those around him to protect themselves only to have people die horribly. And he took it into his own hands.

He was given the real world trolly problem. And he chose the ones he loved. Maybe not entirely cause he's a good hearted compassionate person, but it def wasn't bloodlust either."
nan,Icy-Elephant7768,he did all to get killed by mikasa and thus erase the titans.
nan,MrDoulou,My favorite part about the ending was Armin and Annie’s cute and not at all cringey relationship. Really tied the room together.
MrDoulou,YeahItsMeTwo,"I mean, I thought it was a little cringey.

""Hey, Annie, I know you massacred my friends and lied to me for 3 years, but I ate this guy who was crushing on you. Wanna date and be vague and shy about our feelings even though its the end of the world?""

  
Isayama did a great job at disconnecting most of Attack on Titan from Japanese culture, but the whole 'being super non-forward about feelings' thing was annoying. I know that how things are over there, but these two could be part of the last surviving members of Earth. Just be open instead of ""noooo im shyy stawwhp armin 😣😳😖\*-blushes-\*"""

nan,sapphictears,"Genuinely asking, i could be wrong about this, i hought only 20% of the population survives nonetheless? So either 20% of paradis survives or 20% outside the world? I don’t remember where i got this from, either anime or manga, but for some reason its in my head. Also, if he had no other choice than to do that, wouldn’t it have occurred nonetheless later on regardless? That’s not to absolve of Eren’s guilt, but according to the paths, wasn’t there no other outcome?"
nan,Flat-Organization230,"i like to think he gave them the freedom to fight back because they’d never wronged him like the world had. He began the rumbling for his own sick satisfaction and reasoned/justified it by using how bad and racist the world outside the walls was. However, he couldn’t dehumanize those he knew. He knows all of his friends, he has an understanding of them as complex individuals, and therefore can’t bring himself to take from them. Maybe I just think thjs because I believe people who commit horrific acts can USUALLY only do it by making their victim less-than-human. This shows up in so many cases of serial killings and abuse. He does this by considering them “slaves”, but he knows Mikasa isn’t a slave because she kills him at the end directly contradicting his previous slave statement. It’s also harder to add a static label to people you know on a deep level. Though I think he’s a very unreliable narrator at the end, with his lying and all. Maybe narrator isn’t the right word, but everything he says can’t be taken as absolute fact (ex: the ackerman curse, why he’s doing the rumbling, how he feels about his friends, etc.) so I think the friend hero thing is a middle ground. He’s using it as a pro to his actions, but it’d be stupid to assume that is what guided him to act. Just a plus in his mind and a way to make it make the most sense it can to Armin (because he KNOWS armin and knows his mind like I said previously)"

What I wanted from that moment was for that version of Eren to be stopped. Not the one crying because Mikasa is going to get with another guy. I feel like making it all a persona he put on towards the end just made it a lot worse than it had to be. I'm fine with the cycle of hatred and the being nigh impossible to break. I'm fine with Eren being irredeemably evil. I just wanted it to be handled in a way where the character we've been following all this time didn't basically go ""I was just an idiot"" he's a product of a broken worls. Let him go out believing in ""way"""
nan,sonic1384,I mean we all know that AOT ending was a bad copy of geass's ending.
nan,Ilovetottehamthelily,It’s too hard to accept the facts that Eren was completely unjustified and that all our main characters should have died
nan,Illustrious-Date652,"It can be argued that he didn’t know he would be stopped until he reached the coordinate and Ymir herself. All his future memories weren’t accessible to him yet, argument goes that upon seeing his full un fragmented memories he goes “well that’s fucken stupid. Might as well just die atp” he was fully intending to wipe out the world, but decided last minute to make it easier to kill him. He would’ve accepted either outcome, and because of this halfassing the problem is never solved and the cycle of violence just repeats after he’s dead. The refusal to truly change and end the cycle is a prevalent theme throughout the story, and as shown it just results in the cycle getting worse and worse each time until there’s nothing left….. or maybe he really was faking the whole time and just wanted to berk- I mean, attack all over the place"
nan,East_Broccoli_1785,He almost explicitly stated those as the reasons he did it though. Don’t act like people are misinterpreting it when he almost literally says those exact things.
nan,thenameless685,"I mean its simple the world was at war with them before the rumbling there was only two options kill them or be killed. He choosed to kill them, the only stupid thing was killing 80% he should have killed all of them, take away the ability of your friends to act etc.

Now the remaining 20% will still try to kill them but it will give them time to catch up. But still its a small island vs 20% of the world."
nan,Ok-Selection670,He literally tried everything he said so himself. Thats how he knows how many he kills thats how he knows the future. He's tried multiple scenarios none of them worked this was the only one that worked. It's not about morality that's just how it played out in this story.
Ok-Selection670,Bee-cube,"I think this would go down better with the fans who found this problematic if there actually was a few short, flashback scenes or even manga panels with awesome compositions depicting what his several other solutions were instead of a speech balloon with the text, ""bro, I tried it all, trust me, need 80% of humanity extinct or else it doesn't work, it's the only answer""
I just don't buy that all the scenes, ALL nations from the future try not to help Paradis at all when we have references in the real world of humans being kind to the atrocious despite their atrocities during a war.
Isayama being Japanese is doubly ironic."
Bee-cube,Ok-Selection670,That would be cool that's what this movie should have been that I haven't watched
Ok-Selection670,tey_ull,"I always interpreted that moreso as a ""I tried everything to divert from this, but I failed"" you have to remember how desperate he was to not do the rumbling in episode 87, and how he never had the full picture of what the future will look like until he already started the rumbling, he had a few scenes in his head, the start of the rumbling(which most likely would have included historia), sasha's death, etc, so he tries averting that by acting on his own, but sereing he can't see what leads to the events he saw, his actions just cause the very things he saw in his visions, making him to break down and accept that is the only way.  
Eren was always a person who desired freedom, who was constantly forced into being a slave to circumstance, Eren truly was an idiot because the ways he tried to avert would clearly lead to worse outcomes, if he just trusted his friends, things would have ended differently."
nan,Orleanist,"eren has never been especially intelligent. it would be bad character work to have him suddenly be a conniving genius with 5 steps behind every move. hes a radicalized emotional genocidal child born of war. all hes being is consistent lmao.

obviously hes grown evident through his absolute nihilism by the end of the series as opposed to his almost hopeful and positive outlook on beyond the walls in s1"
nan,12345noah,"Do people forget he saw the future? He knew this was the only way forward AND he did NOT want to do it. 

The world was going wipe out paradise island, it was his people or the world, and he choose his people. He also did it in a way so that titans would no longer exist. 

We saw our terrifying this world is, we saw how horrible it is and how long it’s been horrible. But we draw the line at genocide in the current timeline? Knowing genocide has likely occurred many times over in the past due to titans.

He knew there was no way forward without violence, so instead of delaying the inevitable he decided to break the cycle. 

He wasn’t selfish or crazy, he gave up everything for this when he could’ve just postponed it until he died in a few years and the cycle continues."
12345noah,tey_ull,"you forgot that he didn't see the full future, only what he sent to grisha, which was purposefully vague to make grisha do the actions he needed to do.  
eren had no idea that it was the only way, he just knew it could happen, and in trying to avoid it(by going on the other side of the sea and so on) brought the exact events he feared to fruition, the only reason he could not avoid said events was because he was indeed, a dumb idiot with to much power."
tey_ull,12345noah,"Even if he knew of a way to avoid war, I doubt he would’ve taken it. This whole debate about his actions are kinda pointless because people mainly say he committed genocide (which is bad) but genocide against the people in paradise was inevitable. 

And let’s say you disagree that genocide was inevitable. Eren and those in power only had a few years left and unless they let someone eat them the power is passed on randomly. Basically what I’m saying is the cycle would continue and further genocide utilizing the titans would be inevitable.

Eren broke the cycle, whether you agree with how he did it or not. He created a net positive for the world with his actions"
nan,IchibeHyosu99,"What he did is even worse than that, with making sure only 20% survives, he gurantees enough non Eldian population with hate for Eldians, and making sure all of them dies in next 100 years.

Like going 100% in genocide, or only using giants defensively, or going with Zeke's plan, all better results for Eldians than what Eren did.

You cant justify this with ""I want my friends to be MCs in a theatre play I will knowingly lose"""
IchibeHyosu99,None,"He rationalized it man, how is that not clear? Eren isn't a martyr, he actually wanted to flatten the world, but gave his friends. The freedom to stop him.

He didn't make sure 20 percent survived, he wanted to wipe out all but he was stopped. Holy shit it's not hard to comprehend"

He says he's an idiot because it's a meta way of telling the yeagerist fanbase that eren is wrong. People like him are a problem regardless of their intentions. Eren is self aware enough to know that what he did was fucked up. By having him spell out to your side of the fanbase, he's actively telling you lot not to idolize him.

Only ymir knows is isayama's way of spelling it out to  the illiterate portion of the fanbase that eren doesn't understand why ymir was waiting for mikasa's choice. He's the only one to approach her in the paths, and he committed genocide. Paralleling fritz, who also did the same, except ymir had a twisted love for him that never wavered. Mikasa made the choice to kill eren, which ymir couldn't do with fritz.

Ymir wanted to see what Mikasa would do. It's really that simple."
None,deadenfish,"Except he litterally says; ""I don't know why I did it"" in his final moments, it's so stupid. Isayamas could have left it at being disappointed but he retconned that too"

None,OSMOrca,It's not like Erwin was a slave to his dream without ever learning the truth about the basement or anything right...
None,j4ckbauer,Freedom isn't a 'feeling' it is a concept that people define very differently.  As you get older you will notice that some people refer to it as the freedom FROM other people doing unwanted things to you.  While some define it as the freedom TO do things to other people.

None,Ryry_MyGuy,"I don't think it's entirely accurate to say ""a feeling he never experienced"" when that's kind of his motivation from the beginning. Until Armin and Eren looked at the book about the outside world, Eren was free. His view of how big the world is was based on what he knew at the time. Until he saw the book, there were no enemies aside from titans and the world outside the walls didn't exist. 

During a flashback scene (I can't remember exactly where in the show it was), Eren is shown looking up at the wall saying he was bored and wished something ""interesting"" would happen. Eren describing life as boring is a pretty clear sign his desire to strive for freedom only manifested after seeing it in the book.

So I think Eren had experienced it but it was taken from him. From his perspective, almost every main enemy they face in the show is attempting to keep Eren from having what he describes as true freedom. With every new enemy stood a new metaphorical ""wall"" that kept him from reclaiming his freedom. It doesn't try to justify the rumbling in the sense that it's viewed as good or the right choice. I think Eren felt that every time he overcomes one of these ""walls"", there are 3 taller ones built in it's place. There was no way around it in *his* mind."
