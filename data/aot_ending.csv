The video quality for my language was horrible on Crunchyroll, so I contacted support and waited from February till now for them to fix it.


I sadly got spoiled a bit before, but it didn't really hinder the experience that much. It was still imo a very well done ending. Though I have a kind of love-hate-relationship with the ""open"" end.


But enough of that. I have a few questions that I can't awnser myself, even if I think about them for a bit. I'm no manga reader by the way. I have the first volume, but basically have no knowledge outside of the anime (if that is in any way relevant).


First: **Why does Eren have green eyes right after he is born, but has blue eyes when he is older?** 


I noticed that in the scene where Eren visits Armin (the one where they both sit in blood). It cuts to Eren as a baby right after his mother gave birth to him and his father holds him in his arms. Then he opens his eyes and they definitely have a green tone. The flashback ends and it cuts to a closeup of the current Eren that has almost skyblue eyes. I skipped back a few times to make sure that I'm not just seeing things. I now wonder if there is an explanation for this (that I overheard or forgot) or if that is just a mistake. If there is no clear or obvious seeming awnser, I'm not that interested in it. I'm not here for wild fan theories, but I would like to hear a plausible one (if it exists). It's just that when I saw the scenes directly after each other, I thought to myself that something so obvious would probably be noticed in QA or even before that. So it being a mistake would be very unlikely. (Timestamp: 1:05:40) Edit: Watched the scene again and I think I just saw things. Maybe it's due to the different lighting. The color still looks different. What do you think?


Second: **Who gives birth to whom in the hospital scene?** 


Right after or rather during the explosion caused by Armin turning into a titan, we see someone giving birth. I at first thought it was Armin's mother giving birth to him. But looking at it again it could also be Historia giving birth. Am I right with that guess? I think I understand the intention of the scene and it doesn't really change, no matter if it is Armin's mother or Historia. But I would simply like to know. (Timestamp: 00:43:25)


Third, and most important question: **Why are all titan powers ""gone"" all of a sudden?** ""Gone"" is in quotation marks, because the ending scene implies that the boy finds what may be left of Eren and maybe gains titan powers again (at least this is how I interpret it). 


Back to the question: It is said that Mikasa ended all titan powers, because she killed Eren. But doesn't killing a titan-shape-shifter normally mean that another person gains the titan powers (somehow) and that they never get lost? Isn't this the whole reason why simply killing all Eldia doesn't work and Zeke made the euthanasia plan (google translated, don't know if that is how they call it in English)? Why is everyone that turned into a titan normal again? Does it have something to do with Mikasa's and Ymir's connection? I'm a bit confused about this whole part.



I would be very grateful if someone could awnser me these questions. Thanks in advance!

As I understand it, there was the TV versions (rushed animations and not great) and the Blu-ray versions (had more time, the true final version of what they intended).

I also understand that this was also true for The Final Chapters. BUT. I've heard there is a 3rd version of The Final Chapters that splits the two specials into 7 Episodes (which I find odd since there's 5 ""chapters"" in the two specials), complete with opening and end credit sequences. Now I'm not a mathematician, but the time doesn't quite allow for 7 full episodes. It really seems like they'd need to add 40 minutes of content.

Here is what I wanna know: 

* What is added to these episodes to pad out the additional time? Is it just a crap ton of recaps and flashbacks or something? Is it brand new material not in the two specials? 

* If there is added material (recap or new), what is it and when does it happen?

*  Are the 7-Episode versions better than the two specials? Which is better/more complete?

* Do the 7-Episode versions utilize the TV or Blu-ray quality versions?

Just watched 4x15 and loved where it cut off. However, it only furthered something I've been wondering about- just how long is this last episode gonna be?  It was confirmed a while back that the final episode (of part one) would premiere on the 28th, one week from today. There's a *lot* they need to pack in.

\-Zeke's Resurrection

\-Pieck and Gabi's conversation with Eren

\-The Warriors arriving on Paradis

\-The e*ntire Shiganshina Fight.* 

\-Zeke arriving and screaming 

\-Eren's head getting shot off 

Just off of memory, that took up maybe 6 manga chapters? This season has been going at a steady 2 chapters per ep, so that leads me to believe this final episode will either A) be an hour and a half long or B) end up incredibly underwhelming. Either or.

It's also a nice call back for **the first chapter/episode of Attack on Titan ""To You, 2000 Years From Now.""** As for the remaining chapters, it could be a movie since it doesn't seem like it would have enough chapters left for another Part 2.

Isayama had a problem with the manga. He wrote a protagonist turned villain character, telling a story through an unreliable narrator, and got a lot of push back for leaving everything too in the open. It seems to me that in the last two episodes of the anime, The Final Chapters pt.1 and pt.2, he had a clear purpose in mind, of making Eren's character arc, his actions and motives, more clear.

Yet, it seems quite a lot of fans didn't quite get it. I wanna be clear. I firmly believe that it has been made crystal clear that Eren's motives are selfish. In the last two episodes, we are presented with 5 moments where we see Eren's thoughts, either in his mind, either through dialogue. Only 5 moments, and the first 4 are rather small. I want to present these 5 moments, and show how they create a clear narrative to beautifully Eren's story, in a very non ambiguous way.

This is **DIALOGUE/THOUGHS NUMBER 1**:

>In the future, though I'm not sure exactly how far, I massacre these people.\
Before too long, they'll all die. No, I kill them. It's already determined that I do. I imagine no one ever found a way for Paradis Island to survive. Everything here will be gone. The homes, the people, the animals, people's lives, their dreams...\
What would mom think? Shouldn't we Eldians be the ones to die? In the same way the King of the walls chose the path to humanity's downfall? At the very least, the death toll on the island would be but a fraction of that of the rest of the world.\
It's also true that if Eldians completely die out, the Titan problem goes away.\
But an ending like that? I just can't accept it.

He then sees Ramzi being beat up, and realizes he's gonna save him. He questions himself and the nonsense of saving the kid he'll eventually kill, but ends up doing it anyway, realizing he couldn't change the outcome. Now. we have the second piece of dialogue/thoughts from Eren (**DIALOGUE/THOUGHTS NUMBER 2**):

>[thoughts] I'm the same as you, Reiner. A half-assed piece of shit. No, that's wrong. I'm worse than that.\
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\
&#x200b;\
(Ramzi) Why are you crying?
&#x200b;\
The reality of the world outside the walls was diferente from the world I dreamed of... It was diferente from the world I saw in Armin's book.\
When I learned... that humanity had survived out here... I felt it. I'd never been so let down.\
I... made a wish... that all of it would be wiped away.\
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

Not much later, we get to see the Founding Titan, and Eren is on top of it. The scene switches between the Titans killing people and the plain mass of meat and blood, and Eren's view from the top. We see him as Child Eren. He looks extremely happy, and raises his arm as he looks to the clean view of the entire blue sky, with lots of clouds. We are presented his thoughts, mid Rumbling (**DIALOGUE/THOUGHTS NUMBER 3**):

>From the moment I was born, those stifling walls were the farthest I could see.\
Water that glows like fire. Fields of ice. Sandy snowfields.\
To witness all that, was to know the greatest freedom this would could offer.\
This is it. It's freedom! We've found it. Somewhere we can look out, and see everything.\
Right, Armin?

Scene cuts to Armin by Eren's side, as an adult, wounded, in The Paths. Mid Rumbling, while people died, Eren wasn't paying attention to the deaths. He was looking at the view he Always dreamed of, and calling for Armin to see it with him.

Way after, his friends arrive to stop him. He calls all of them on The Paths, and delivers this speech (**DIALOGUE/THOUGHTS NUMBER 4**):

>I will hold freedom in my hands, by taking it from this world. But from you, I will take nothing. You are all free. You are free to oppose me... and defend the world's freedom. Just as I am free to move forward. Our convictions can never be reconciled, and our wills will not bend. There is only one way for this to be resolved. Fight\
&#x200b;\
(Armin) But then... Then why do this? If talking wont help, then why bring us here?
&#x200b;\
I brought you here to say that there is nothing left to say. You will only stop my advance, when you stop me from breathing. And you are free to try. 

Its interesting that he is now talking very confident. This seems to be a pre-thought speech. Note that he is talking not only to his friends, but to the Warriors as well.

Finally, after they kill him, we have the last piece into Eren's mind, his dialogue with Armin (**DIALOGUE/THOUGHTS NUMBER 5**):

Armin: It was all to push us away, and make us into the heroes who killed you and saved humanity from annihilation?\
&#x200b;\
Eren: That's right. Every surviving human would owe you a debt of gratitude. Island devils who went against the island and stayed true to the path of humanity. It would make you the most respected individuals in the world.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: So you're telling us to protect Paradis from reprisal by the rest of the world, like the Tybur family after the Great Titan War? There's no way we can become heroes, Eren. Sorry to disappoint you, but neither I nor the others intend to play the hero like you want (...)\
&#x200b;\
Eren: I slaughtered humanity, caused Eldians to kill each other on Paradis, and dragged my dear friends into combat, without ever knowing whether they'd survive.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: That's the future you saw at the medal ceremony(...)\ 
&#x200b;\
Armin: Eren! Let's keep trying! Let's find another way!\
&#x200b;\
Eren: We can't! I'm sure none of them wanted to die, either. And yet... I... Eighty percent.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: What?\
&#x200b;\
Eren: I trample eighty percent of humanity.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: How could you?! Eren! Why?
&#x200b;\
Eren: I attempt a complete eradication of humanity outside the walls, and all of you stop me. And ultimately, eighty percent die.\
The world outside the walls drops to the same level of civilization as Paradis. Which means there won't be a one-sided war of reprisal, but this conflict doesn't end.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: What the hell do you mean? Are you trying to say what we've done is all pointless? The massacre hasn't occurred yet! Just stop it!\
&#x200b;\
Eren: I can't. Twenty percent of humanity is all you manage to save. It's already been determined.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: ""Been determined""? Didn't you determine it? Didn't you kill them?\
Eren: So, so many times I tested it, all to no avail. Things always occurred exactly as I saw in my memories of the future.\ Armin, it's just as you said. I'm... a slave to freedom.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: This is... absolutely crazy! You're saying... it can't be undone? This can't be! This isn't a solution at all! What, you can't have war if there are no people?
It's like a bad joke! Who would take it seriously?\
Eren, it's true that there's no end in sight for this conflict, and I'm sure the hell we went through has happened over and over.\
But we need to think that despite it all, one day, we can eventually come to understand one another...\
And now no one will have any faith, not even in something as small as that! The only lesson they'll be left with... is that they must kill, or be killed. That's all.\
And you're saying you did all this for us?\
&#x200b;\
Grisha: Eren. That's your name\
&#x200b;\
Eren: No. I didn't.\
&#x200b;\
Grisha: Eren, you're free.\
&#x200b;\
Eren: I wanted to level everything. I wanted to see this sight.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: Why?\
&#x200b;\
Eren: I don't know why. I just wanted to do it... so very badly. I thought I was doing everything to protect all of you.\
But Sasha and Hange died because of me, and I wound up putting you in lethal confrontations with Floch.\
Why... Why did it turn out this way? I finally know. It's because I'm an idiot. A garden-variety idiot who got his hands on power. That's all there is to it, right?\
&#x200b;\
Armin: I get it. Wanting to erase people from the world... I've felt that way, too.\
&#x200b;\
Eren: Liar. You would never—\
&#x200b;\
Armin: Nobody would guess it, considering I'm a hero who saved twenty percent of humanity.\
Still, it was me that showed you the book about the outside world. The one who put the idea of a free, unoccupied world in your head was me (...)\
Thank you, Eren. For showing me what was beyond the walls. For showing me this sight. We did this.\
So after this we'll be together forever, won't we?\
&#x200b;\
Eren: After this? Where?\
&#x200b;\
Armin: In hell, assuming it exists. We'll suffer for the sin of killing eighty percent of humanity. Together.\
&#x200b;\
Eren: Armin, it's time. I'm erasing your memory of our time here, but once everything is over, you'll remember again.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: I know. Our next meeting will be a fight to the death. And the next one after that...\
&#x200b;\
Eren: Yeah. I'll be waiting for you. In hell.\
&#x200b;\
Armin: Right. We'll be together, forever.

I cutted some of the last dialogue, but I'll leave a link to a post where you can read it in full. Anyways. I think it's very clear if you watch the last two episodes and pay attention to these 5 moments, that the story is showing us Eren slowly coming to terms with his true motives. The story then asks us to also come to terms with it, just like it asks Mikasa.

Immediately after arriving at Marley, we see Eren questioning himself. We see how he still havnt figured out why he'll do The Rumbling (TR). He first considers that it must be because they didn't find a way to protect Paradis, but shrugs this idea off. Later the same day, he has already realized the bigger truth. He admits to Ramzi (to himself) that as soon as he realized there were humans outside the walls, he wished for them to be wiped out.

The first 2 happens b4 TR. The next 2 happens during TR. We can see a shift in attitude. One during TR we get to see him by himself. He is happy and calling for Armin, he has no eyes towards the floor, he shows no regret whatsoever. The other one is call for fight.

Lastly, we get to see him breaking down to Armin, having a heart to heart conversation, that happens before TR, during wbich which he finally realizes why he does what he does. 

He wants to see the world as he has always envisioned it. He wants it so much, that he keeps looking into the future, yet the outcome doesn't change. It always is what he wants the most.

Realizing how he really does hate the fact that he'll kill 80% of humanity, how he really does hate the fact Hange and Sasha dies, how he really does lead his friends to suffering and pain; yet all of this ain't enough to top his main dream... Breaks him. That's is what Eren being a slave to freedom means.

Now comes the tough part, where many of you who were with me, might disagree to some extent, or might have a hard time with this thought process.

Its ""easy"" to regret a crime, it's hard to actually not do it. While his regret and suffering is 100% real, it wasn't enough for him to not do his evil deed. Eren is the villain. He is a villain protagonist. Isayama does a great twist on this theme of regret, because usually ppl suffer from regret after doing the crime. But AoT is a lot about destiny and freewill and determinism... Eren is doomed to regret his crime, even before doing it. And that's what we get to watch happening in these last two episodes. 

Its also nice we don't get an attempted justification for genocide. We see the story of the genocidal guy, and we learn that deep inside, even him knows his rationalizations were false.

Relatively, it's as tough for us to let go of Eren as it is for his friends. Just like his friends, we are supposed to sympathize to a degree with him, to understand him. But to let go, and understand that he must be stopped, and that nothing justifies what he did.

Also, do note how he is ""just like Reiner"". Reiner, much like Eren, has an ulterior motive which he is ashamed of. Not to save Marley from these monsters, but his deep wish to be considered a hero.",False,False,attackontitan,"Eren Arc from war victim to war criminal, and his ulterior motives",0.91,https://i.redd.it/mqoffqu87z1f1.jpeg

Many have suggested about how this cycle of violence can end, how this entire post credit scene could have been prevented, and many refute those claims saying it is impossible. I wanted to give my own perspective, showcasing the evidence from the series and what it is trying to say, and give my own two cents, on how we can end this cycle  
I believe it is best to start in what many consider to be in some way the point where Marley could’ve changed the entire outcome, with a common consensus being that if willy has not declared war, then the ensuing future violence wouldn’t have happened, as it was the only way to prevent tragedies being committed upon the island of Paradis, and yet I find this to be quite dismissive of the previous episodes and the next few. In first measurement, we have clearly been shown mentions in where Zeke has been in some way manipulating things behind the scenes to propose and be the main catalyst to the events of declaration of war. He pushes a narrative that Marley easily takes and spins into a call of arms against the people of Paradis. Adding onto this, Eren Yeager was already in the basement under the ceremony preparing to attack. This wasn’t a reactionary attack, at least, not more than it is premeditated. Eren has already seen some of the choices he will commit, and in some way, he’s simply walking on that path in this point of the story  
but, some would say that if Marley didn’t really want to start this, it shouldn’t have sent those titans years ago and killed the thousands in Shiganshina. I think the main problem with this argument is it plays into a cycle of simply pushing the blame on the other for “starting” it without considering the actual decisions being at play. Part of the reason I started the declaration of war was mainly to showcase how easy it is to simply push the blame onto Eren and Zeke and say it was they who started the war. The truth is though; it isn’t that simple. If we go back to the most ancient history we are shown in the story, we could simply put the blame on king fritz and his kingdom of Eldia as the reason it started or even be pettier and say it started because Ymir freed those pigs. Sure, it isn’t wrong, but it technically is where all this started isn’t it? But here’s the thing, as Eren asks in chapter 130, “where did all of this begin”, he answers with “it doesn’t matter”. It truly does not matter where it started, because this didn’t happen because Marley declared war, or because Eren saw the future, or because Carla Yeager was brutally killed. This started because humanity has decided to give in to its worst impulses and choose fear and hatred above forgiveness, understanding, and empathy.  
I think this takes us into our next point of forgiveness, with many refuting the point of how you can’t simply forgive or give up. I think we need to make a clear point, that the series, while condoning forgiveness and empathy, is also in some way showcasing its somewhat idealistic ideology. Nothing is that simple, and that’s in some way part of what this story is about. It’s a showcase of how complicated human emotions can get, from rage to fear, selfishness to selflessness, and from despair to hope. Nothing is that simple, and what makes this story is the difficulty the characters make with every decision they are met, with their struggles being challenged to the extreme. The island of Paradis should fight back, yes, but they fell into the same problem, Fascism. Attack on Titan is very clear on its opinion of fascism. It clearly demonstrates how not only morally bankrupt it is, but it shows how easy it is to fall into. The story even shows how easy it is of a decision to make. It isn’t a difficult decision of “necessary evil”. It is a showcase how choosing horrible violence is a stupid and easy solution. It clearly showcases how the people of Paradis have fallen to become just like the people of Marley. The Alliance when they “betrayed” their country, was an arguably more difficult decision. The story showcases that things can’t be so idealistic, that it isn’t all rainbows and sunshine, that there is struggle, but it also showcases how easy it is to pick the other extreme despite that struggle “showcasing” the consequences. I am trying to bring up that this is only going on because of the on-going choices everyone makes, that they simply choose hatred and violence rather than face the ""difficult"" reality and solution.  
I think an important point to be brought up here, as I have already gotten into in the previous paragraph, is the difficulty of the choice the alliance had to make. From the side of the soldiers of Marley, they are enemies of Paradis, they were a major catalyst for why Eren committed the rumbling. Reiner and Annie clearly showcase extreme guilt over what they have done in the past, and now they must live with the fact that the deaths of not only their past lives, but the death of those outside the walls. Now the soldiers of Paradis, compromising of soldiers from the survey corps, are in the midst of living with a difficult guilt of having a hand in helping Eren start the rumbling. Not only this, but as showcased with Hange, in chapter 127, she not only sees this as a horrible and morally bankrupt solution, but she is currently carrying the weight of all those before her. The lives of those who gave everything for humanity, not knowing what really was beyond the walls. People who died giving and dedicating their hearts for that unreachable freedom. Were all those lives….simply made to serve the death of billions? Were all our struggles, our sacrifices, our sorrow, hopes, dreams, was all of it for the sake more death upon those we simply deemed as “enemies”? Many seemed to have said that Floch was right, that war did continue upon Paradis eventually, that if Eren finished the rumbling, it wouldn’t have happened, and that this proved Hange wrong, yet in Floch’s final moments, Hange in some way gives him comfort, acknowledging his fears, saying that he was right, but then she perhaps says one of the most important lines in the series.  
“But we can’t give up, even if it’s hopeless today, maybe someday”. This line encapsulates the message Attack on Titan wants to portray in it’s cycle of violence. The desire to want to fight not for survival, not for your country, your dreams, but for peace. May it be peace of the soul, or peace of the world, there will be a day where we all live in peace, even if temporary. That’s what life is. A struggle to find Peace, and those who fight against it will die an unfulfilling death, and those who fight for it, will see a light at the end brighter than the flaming wings of freedom  
The cycle of violence, does not end, not unless we try. The imagery of the final post credits scene showcases a tree akin to that of Ymir’s and Hallucigenia’s tree yet given a spark of hope in the bathing sunlight. A showcase that even in the aftermath of war, in the midst of its sorrowful destruction, there will always be hope for a better, more peaceful day, and that is worth dedicating our hearts for, all the way to the very end.

(Which is pretty understandable)

So here's my review of it

Attack on Titan is a name I’m pretty sure the majority of anime fans have heard of. It’s one of those animes where even if you aren’t an anime fan you might’ve heard or know about it alongside Dragon Ball, Pokémon, Studio Ghibli movies, Naruto, Sailor Moon, My Hero Academia, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Demon Slayer just to name a few.

Attack on Titan is such a phenomenon that it got referenced in American cartoons like  [THE FRICKIN SIMPSONS](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FVcryJQvKBBdh0Ut1wVEHffErAVSC5meegw_HXsnKM_s.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D1d7a0c5d7c3cb15809271e12ab5ac9352169836c) and [The Amazing World of Gumball](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fim-guessing-this-was-a-aot-reference-v0-22phrbah9gv81.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D0ce37a758b5d694fd1b0a80eb201b15e58e706db).

So what made this series special?

I guess you can say a lot of factors like it's worldbuilding, it's Western setting (in the beginning specifically), it doesn't really have fanservice that's borderline pornographic so you can be able to watch with with others, the amazing animation, story, and the zombie aspect of the show.  Lots of things made this show feel unique compared to other anime.

Attack on Titan has gone a long way as the manga started out from being rejected by Shonen Jump (because it wasn’t Jump like Friendship, Effort, and Victory) to having it’s anime holding the Guinness World Record for the ""Most in-demand anime TV show"" in 2021 and 2022.

It’s also worth noting that the English Dub of Attack on Titan is one of those Dubs that it’s dubbing studio Funimation (or now Crunchyroll) has a notable case of numerous VAs that aren’t from Texas voicing characters much like other popular Funimation shows like Dragon Ball, My Hero Academia, and One Piece. The reason I say this is because for most of Funimation’s shows you’ll likely expect the majority of the cast to be filled with VAs from Texas, however with how huge in popularity the show became many VAs wanted to have a role voicing a character from this show. Take Eren’s English Voice Actor Bryce Papenbrook as he is usually in Dubs recorded in LA, he wanted to be in Attack on Titan’s English Dub because he was a huge fan of the show when the sub simulcast came out.

Bryce wasn’t the only VA that was a fan of it before being cast in the English Dub as Armin’s, Shardis’, Floch’s, Pieck’s, Falco’s, and Hange’s VAs were fans of the show before being cast as on of the Characters

**History (Normally you wouldn't see this type of stuff but** [This guy](https://www.deviantart.com/ttlf) **inspired me to add these)**

My oldest memory of hearing Attack on Titan was when it was airing on Toonami in 2014. I wasn’t allowed to watch anything higher than TV-PG since the show was rated TV-MA and was on Adult Swim at the time so I didn’t get to check it out until years later.

I learned about the manga years later at middle school from one of my classmates and I at the time had no idea that most anime were based on manga.

When I got into anime in 2018 Attack on Titan was one of those shows everyone was talking about, but what really sparked my interest was by listening to Jonathan Young’s cover of the opening. I loved the opening and listening to how catchy it was got me interested in watching the anime. I only watched the first episode, I have no idea why I didn’t continue at the time, probably because I was much more interested in MHA.

In 2019 I started reading the manga and was up to date around September of the next year around the same time Chapter 132 of the manga came out. After that I decided to watch the anime in order to catch up because The Final Season was airing around that time.

For the most part I watch the Final Season as it came out with the sole exception of the last special in which I watched it almost a week after it came out mainly because during my time between Specials 1 and 2 I was in Basic Training but it never worked out.

After being hyperfixated on the series again I decided to rewatch the entirety of it last month and while AOT was always one of my favorite shows this rewatch really solidified that it’s one of the best shows I ever watched.

**Story 10/10**

After losing his home and his mother Eren swores to kill all of the titans. The first couple of episodes are a really good build up for what’s to come. Like in episode 2 you can find Reiner, Bertolt, and Annie as children in Wall Rose, and when Eren talks about the Colossal and Armored Titans it goes to Bertolt and Reiner. And not to mention Grisha giving Titan injection on Eren so he can avenge his mom.

The turning point of the series for me is when Jean finds Marco’s corpse and we’re actually introduced to the Survey Corps with all of that leading up to the female titan arc.

As far as the Female Titan arc goes I will say it’s the weakest of the biggest arcs in the series but it’s still great overall. The Annie twist has to be my favorite part, with Eren, Mikasa, and Armin confronting Annie and Annie laughing after they all find out she’s the female titan.

Overall the first season is really great

The second season when things start to get better. We’re introduced to a new titan named the Beast Titan who’s actually Eren’s brother from another mother and one of the biggest twists in all of anime.

>I'm the Armored Titan and he's \[Bertolt\] the Colossal Titan

>\- Reiner Braun

That’s right, one of Eren’s comrades Reiner told Eren that he was the Armored Titan and another comrade Bertolt was the Colossal Titan. Meaning that they're the ones responsible for what happened in Wall Maria and what killed Eren’s mom.

Eren doesn’t believe them until they transform.

The Class of Titans arc is one of my favorite arcs in the series. Outside of the twist we get the reveal of Historia’s real name and Ymir (freckles) being a titan shifter too.

And Bertolt telling the rest of the scouts that even despite the fact that they were traitors he and Reiner still considers them as friends was amazing, especially knowing him, Reiner, and Annie’s backstories.

Season 3 was split into 2 cours

The first cour is centered on the Uprising with Survey Corps commander Erwin having a plan overthrow the government and Historia’s dad Rod Reiss manipulating Historia into eating Eren so that the family can regain the Founding Titan that was stolen by them from Eren’s dad Grisha who has now given it to Eren after he gave Eren Titan injection and Eren eats Grisha. This backfired and as a result Rod licks the Titan injection serum and became a Titan that was faceless.

We also get to know about the Ackerman clan as we’re introduced to Kenny Ackerman as he initially wanted to gain the Founding Titan because he saw how kind Uri and Freida Reiss were and thought the same could happen to him but he eventually realized what the Founding Titan’s power is not what he expects. And he also gave us this amazing quote:

>Everybody I've met... was all the same. Drinking... Women... Worshipping God, even... Family... The King... Dreams... Children... Power... Everyone had to be drunk on somethin' to keep pushing on. Everyone... was a slave to somethin'.

>\- Kenny Ackerman

The less we talk about the chair scene the better. Overall the arc does a great job when talking about politics and corruption in general.

The second cour is centered on the Survey Corps reclaiming Wall Maria in which they reunite with 3 of their old foes: Reiner, Bertolt, and the Beast Titan (Zeke).

This arc was perfect from the action to the plot twist revealing that humanity is not perished but rather the cast (including Reiner, Bertolt, Annie, and Zeke) are a race called the Eldians and are considered devils to the rest of the world because they have the ability to turn into titans and are descendants of Ymir Fritz. We also learned how Grisha became the man he eventually became. During the honoring ceremony when Eren kisses Queen Historia’s hand there was a change in him, as he saw his dad confronting the Reiss family and Eren was not the same character ever since.

It’s also important to talk about the book Armin showed to Eren when they were kids as it’s important for this part of the review. When Eren and Armin were kids Armin shows Eren a book about how the outside world looks like, Eren realizes that he has no freedom and wants to become a scout in order to go beyond the walls and achieve freedom with him believing that when he reaches the ocean he’ll get his freedom. When he finally reaches the ocean he realizes he wasn’t free as prior to this he saw the past of his father and how he and the rest of the Eldians were treated and believe by killing their enemies all of them will be free.

Season 4 aka The final Season is has 2 parts and 2 specials

The first part centers around the perspective on the Eldians of Marley as they were brainwashed that they’re race is evil and they must atone for the sins of their fathers. We also get Reiner’s (alongside Bertolt and Annie’s) backstory as his mom manipulated him into thinking that by becoming a Warrior Unit so he would be reunited with his dad (who’s a Marleyan) but when he sees his dad his dad wants nothing to do with them.

There’s also a change in Eren as while he was never a good guy to begin with take for example the time Eren stabbed human traffickers to death (Granted they deserved it)

>Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman at the tender age of 9 dealt with 3 adult kidnappers by stabbing all of them to death. Granted this was done in self-defense, all the same one cannot question the violent nature of the act.

>\- Nile Dok

This arc serves as the build up of Eren unleashing the rumbling as well as the AOT equivalent of White Supremacists: the Yeagerists. They are a group of people who wanted to reunite Eren with his brother from another mother Zeke. And there’s also Zeke’s plan of stopping everyone from giving birth until Historia’s child dies.

The Marley is probably the most intriguing arc yet.

The Second Part of the final season is Peak Fiction.

We get to learn who the founder of the titans Ymir Fritz is as she was a girl who had her land stolen from her by King Fritz and the Eldians. One night Ymir decides to let the pigs free and as a result of that she gets blamed for it and she hunted down because of this.During this she found a large tree and goes in it and falls down into liquid where she connects with the Source of all living matter and that’s how the titans are born. Despite these powers Ymir chooses to go back to King Fritz and he uses her to kill his enemies, and when there was a assassination attempt on King Fritz Ymir chose to die instead. So how does King Fritz repay her? By making her 3 daughters eat her body and this would continue throughout generations.

>The Founder, Ymir loved King Fritz.

>\- Eren Yeager

It’s pretty obvious that Ymir was suffering from Stockholm Syndrome as despite how awful King Fritz treats her, Ymir not only chose to go back to him when she became a titan but also chose to die instead of letting him die. Eren was the only person who treated Ymir as an actual human being and not a tool as Eren tells Ymir that she has the power to choose. Ymir grants Eren the full power of the founding titan and with that Eren commits the rumbling as Eren wanted to kill everyone on earth except Paradis.

But Eren’s friends aren’t happy about this as while they know the rest of the world despises them they know what Eren is doing is morally terrible.

>Genocide is Wrong!

>\- Hange Zoe

So Eren’s friends team up with the Marleyan Eldians (and Magath) to stop Eren and the rumbling and calling themselves the alliance

>To Save the World

>\- Connie Springer

I should mention that Annie comes back after being crystallized since the end of Season 1.

Over the latter half of part 2 and the 2 specials we see the alliance going to find where Eren was in order to kill him.

Seeing the alliance stopping Eren was amazing to watch, as I love Armin talking to Zeke about the meaning of life and how characters like Bertolt, Grisha, Ymir (Freckles), Tom, and the Galliard brothers helped fight off the other titans and Mikasa having to let go of her feelings and be the person that could kill Eren, and she did. As a result the titan curse is over.

After that we get to see Eren and Armin’s conversation before the final battle took place. Eren admits he only did the rumbling because he wanted to and he was an idiot for doing so, as well as this infamous scene where he breaks done over Mikasa

>No, I don’t want that. Mikasa finding another man. I want her to think about me and no one else for the rest of my life! Even after I die... I want to be at the front of her mind for a while. Ten years at least.

>\- Eren Yeager

>Eren is back

>\- Hajime Isayama

As much as what Eren did was wrong, he's 19 years old meaning that he died pretty short. Armin also blames himself as he felt that he was responsible for who Eren eventually became.

This scene was really emotional for me to watch and as someone who read the manga this scene was better handled in the anime compared to the manga.

Armin and Eren say their goodbyes and Eren dies.

Afterwards Eldians are now regular human beings and can no longer turn into titans and the story is over.

Despite this it’s clear that no matter what happens there’s always going to be war as the cycle of hatred ends.

>The world is a cruel place. But it is also very beautiful.

>\- Mikasa Ackerman

While the Cycle of hatred doesn’t end, the ending shows through the scene with Levi, Gabi, Falco, Onyankopon, and Yelena we can be able to heal the harder parts of this world.

Mikasa’s final words were amazing to listen to.

>Thank you for wrapping this scarf around me Eren

>\- Mikasa Ackerman

Overall the story was phenomenal and it’s easily one of my favorite stories in any work of fiction.

**Characters 10/10**

When it comes to Attack On Titan it has one of my favorite cast in any series I’ve seen. While I do have characters I dislike like Kitz, Floch, Sergeant Gross, King Fritz, Historia’s mom, and Rod Reiss, the rest of the cast I really like.

Here are some character I want to talk about:

Eren is a fantastic character. While he was brattier earlier on and didn’t know the world around him, his development as a protagonist was amazing and while he has done some unforgivable stuff even he realized it was dumb.

>I did it because... I wanted to flatten the world. I... don't know why, but, I do. But after everything, to which I don't even know if you guys may survive, the deaths of both Sasha and Hange, the debacle between you guys and Floch, why... why did it turn out this way? And I finally know why: it's because I am an idiot. A garden-variety idiot who got his hands on all of this power. That's why this resolution was the only outcome. That's all there is to it, right?  
\- Eren Yeager

Mikasa has to be my favorite character. I love her bond with Eren especially as a result of Eren taking down the traffickers for what they did to her parents. Over time ever since Eren started to do stuff morally wrong is where her character starts to peak for me. As she learns to accept that the Eren that she once knew is gone and had to kill him in order to save humanity from the rumbling. I also appreciate that she's a great foil to Ymir Fritz.

Armin is another one of my favorite characters. I love how tries to understand everyone, even characters like Bertolt, Annie, and Zeke. He always has this optimism despite how cruel the world is, like his conversation with Zeke telling him that life isn’t meaningless. I also really loved how he started out pretty nervous but became more confident.

Jean started out as this arrogant asshole who only joined the military because he wanted to be in the military police and live the good life. After Marco’s death he started to become an actual leader. Jean has one of the best character developments in the manga.

Levi, what do I need to say? Levi is just that guy. He’s had one of the most tragic lives in the show, and I’m happy that he was able to survive all of it in the end.

Erwin was a person devoted to finding out what was the truth about the world beyond the walls, so much so that so many soldiers had to die for it, it would only take Erwin himself to sacrifice his own life just so the rest of the scouts could know what was outside of the walls.

Reiner is another one of my favorite characters (Top 3). As a kid he wanted to be an honorary Marleyan after being manipulated by his mother into thinking that when he becomes a warrior unit they’ll reunite with his dad, but they don't. Reiner was never fortunate enough as he wasn’t even supposed to be the armored titan. After the attack on Wall Maria, Reiner develops a split personality to cope with it. He has a split personality between Soldier and Warrior as a result.

>Hey... Why... is Marco... being devoured?

>\- Reiner Braun

>

Reiner is a tragic character who became a victim of Marley’s propaganda that it affected his mental health, and I love that he teamed up with his supposed “enemies” in order to take down Eren.

Annie, like Reiner, was half Eldian half Marleyan but was abandoned by her parents and was raised by her adopted father Leonhart. He gave Annie harsh training so that she could become a warrior and it’s the reason why she has such an emotionless attitude about life. But before she leaves to (destroy) Paradis her adopted father apologizes for everything he’s done to her and wants her to promise that she’ll come home. Annie is another one of my favorite characters. Despite her actions she’s not heartless as some people view her like in Season 1 she apologizes to one of the corpses, and she felt bad about setting up Marco to be eaten by a titan. It takes her a while to realize that she actually cares for others over the course of the series. I also loved her relation with both Armin and Hitch

Bertolt like Reiner was a victim of Marley’s propaganda as he even told Eren that he felt sorry for Eren when he learned that when he attacked Wall Maria Eren’s mom died as a result and even tells the rest of the Survey Corps that he and Reiner still considers them as friends when they discover him and Reiner’s true identities. While Bertolt dies in a tragic fate in Return to Shingashina it was great to see him team up with the others through the paths in order to stop the rumbling.

Historia was born as an illegitimate daughter of the Reiss family, she was raised in a farm and her mother who was servant of the Reiss family did not care for her in the slightest mostly out of fear of shaming Historia’s dad Rod. After her mom was killed Historia’s name was changed to Krista Lenz where she acts rather like a shy moe character until she reveals her true identity.

Historia’s character arc is really good and I especially love how she rejected her father’s plan of her eating Eren to become the next founding titan.

Shadis was a character who viewed himself as a failure and watched as the person he had feelings for (Eren’s mom Carla) married another man, and even later on told that woman that she was a worthless individual for not doing anything that contributed to humanity which haunted him later on especially when he found out that died woman died after the attack on Wall Maria. Out of respect for the woman he intentionally sabotaged her son Eren’s ODM gear in order to prevent him from joining the military and save his life but changed his mind after seeing Eren’s determination. Shadis is another one of my favorite characters and I really like how he and Magath sacrificed themselves to stop the rumbling.

Zeke never lived a happy life as a child as his father Grisha viewed him more as a tool than a son and as a result of this he has a rather nihilistic view on humanity. While Zeke isn’t really a character I like that much I really like his character arc in the series especially his conversation with Armin.

Grisha was shamed for being an Eldian for his entire life with one incident resulting in him, his (first) wife Dina, and  the rest of Eldian Restorationists being sent to Paradis to be turned into Pure Titans. Grisha had to watch his friends and wife being turned into titans right in front of his eyes. With Sergeant Gross the man who fed Grisha’s sister to the dogs wanting to send Grisha to Paradis the way he is and get eaten by a titan, but is saved by the other officer there named Eren Krueger who gives Grisha a mission to go to Paradis and take back the Founding Titan and also giving Grisha his Titan.

>It's called

>\- Krueger

>The Attack Titan

>\- Eren Yeager

Grisha is a really intriguing character as he wasn’t alive after he gave Eren the Attack Titan but he’s always been a relevant character ever since then. Grisha is a pretty cool character overall.

Gabi is yet another character that was brainwashed by Marley’s propaganda and thought that Eldians on Marley were the good Eldians while Eldians on Paradis were the bad Eldians. Gabi is not a character I hate despite how much she annoyed me earlier on as she was a product of Marley’s propaganda, she started to grow on me after Niccolo exposed to Sasha’s family that Gabi was the person who killed Sasha. Gabi’s character development was really good, she realizes that there are no devil and she herself was acting like a devil.

Falco after his encounter with Eren (through a disguise) learned that through Eren’s backstory learning that Bertolt and Reiner attacked their home, realized that Marley was feeding him propaganda. He even wanted to become the Armored Titan to save Gabi from inheriting it. He is one of the few characters in the series that lacks any corruption factors which I love.

Ymir Fritz ever since she was enslaved never received freedom ever since she was enslaved by King Fritz. Even when she made contact with the Source of all living and became a titan she went back to King Fritz, when King Fritz was going to be assassinated Ymir chose to die instead. She was trapped into becoming a servant after her death. It wasn’t until Eren came to her when she realized that she has the ability to choose, along with Armin’s conversation with Zeke, and Mikasa killing Eren where she wished that she could’ve allowed Fritz to die instead of saving him. Ymir is a tragic character who was stuck in this slave mindset until she saw through others that she can be able to be free from it. I really liked her character arc.

As for the others I really like Ian, OG Levi squad, Hitch, Carla, Marlo, Sasha, Connie, Pieck, Hange, Onyankopon, Pixis, Hannes, and the goats themself Sawney and Bean.

**Art 10/10**

What do I need to say about the art? The art is fantastic. Though Season 1 art style earlier looks pretty weird when you compare it to the later seasons.

The animation is God Tier.

**Enjoyment 10/10**

AOT is not only one of my favorite anime but one of my favorite fictional works ever created. The show gets better and better with each season. The characters are fantastic and the worldbuilding is amazing.

The soundtrack is epic and how it’s used for certain scenes is handled pretty well.

The openings are amazing with my favorite opening being the first opening while the favorite ending would be the last one from the second special.

In both Sub and Dub the voice acting is phenomenal.

For the dub in particular I really loved J. Michael Tatum’s voice as Erwin especially when he yells

>Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world!

>My soldiers push forward!

>My soldiers scream out!

>My soldiers RAGE!!!

>\-Erwin Smith

There are plenty of other dubs moments i like such as Robert Mccollum saying as Reiner ""Why is Marco being devoured?""

Or Bryce Papenbrook saying as Eren calling on all of the subjects of Ymir

>Hear me, Subjects of Ymir. My name is Eren Jaeger. I'm addressing my fellow Subjects of Ymir, speaking to you directly through the power of the Founder. All the walls on the Island of Paradis have crumbled to the ground, and the legions of Titans buried within have begun their march. My only goal is to protect the lives of the people of Paradis, the island where I was born. Right now, the nations of the world are united in their desire to exterminate my people. And it won't end with our island. They won't be satisfied until every last subject of Ymir is dead. I won't let them have their way. The Titans of the walls....will continue their march, until every trace of life beyond our shores is trampled flat. And the people of Paradis are all that remains of Humanity.

>\-Eren Yeager

>

Or Jessie James Grelle going all out as Armin in the final episode

>GET UP, YOU WASTE OF SPACE! HUMAN GARBAGE! WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT! i hate you.. I HATE YOU! AND I ALWAYS HAVE! BECAUSE YOUVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING BUT BETRAYED ME! the hopes pinned on us, the responsibilities we accepted, the second life we were given… YOU HAVENT DONE A THING WITH ANY OF IT! SO GET UP! HOW DARE YOU LIE HERE DEAD! GET UP!

>\- Armin Alert

Overall it was fun watching this series start to finish.

**My Rating: 10/10**

Attack on Titan was an amazing series to watch start to finish. It has everything I could want in a show. Amazing writing, amazing character, amazing worldbuilding, amazing soundtrack, amazing openings and endings, and amazing voice acting in both sub and dub.

When it comes to Kodansha properites AOT is Top 10 for me the others include Love Hina (Manga as the anime is shit adaptation), A Silent Voice, Vinland Saga, Gachiakuta, Ashita no Joe, Fairy Tail, Fire Force, Ranger Reject (Manga not Anime), and Blue Period (Manga not anime)

Attack on Titan is easily one of my favorite series I’ve ever seen and I’m glad that I managed to get to watch this masterpiece.

Those are my two earlier edited posts about AoT's ending and its unresolved plotholes/plotlines.

1. Eren. Eren as I know allowed himself to be defeated by alliance so his friends would be viewed as heroes and Ymir would lift titan's power. This plan is very risky during battle in port against Jaegerists his friends would easily die by loose bullet or thunder spear . Also, he himself admitted that he did not know wheter they survived or not. And last , but no least they would be stranded in post-apocalyptic world where they may or may not struggle for survival (again after his death and ceasement of titan's powers he wouldn't be able to use his limited clayvoirance). For someone who almost always never gave in and after timeskip became quite solid manipulator and planner is very unusual. Some people can say that he followed predestined path, that past and future was set in stone. Not exactly Eren few times was surprised by things, that were not in his visions of the future like Warhammer's titans powers, sudden attack of Marley at Paradise in ch 117 , Ymir not obeying his orders in chapter 120. There always he took initiative, and tried to come up with solutions on his own, like using Galliard as nutcracker, choosing to battle with Marley in city of Shinigama instead of running away, persuading Ymir that she has the choice. It shows that at least some fragments of future are not set in stone. Other people calim that he lost, not because he wanted to, but because he did not want to take frredom of his friends, by which I reply: HE DID, in chapter 131 he transferred them to Paths, explained them his plan (and showed Arlert few landscapes) and then promptly erased his memory. He is fine with erasing someone's memory. He could use power of founder to erase Alliance members the moment they arrived to him, subdue them, murder the rest of humanity, return memories of alliance members, simulate that he is going mad from guilt and is going to destroy paradise as well (and make it known to people of Paradise), make fake epic battle against him, get killed by Mikasa, curse is lifted, the place where battle happened is on shores of Paradise, happy end. He could as well erase memories of battle at the port beetwen Yaegerist and Alliance so they would not be persecuted. This is not bulletproof plan, in fact I made it on the fly writing this, but the idea is Eren was someone who could plan,scheme use his mind and given his immense power (unlimited time in paths) why did not he formulate better plan.

I could understand Eren's actions if it was showed that he struggled with destiny, but ultimately failed and surrendered to it or if he considered that it was the best option, but it would require few additional chapters that would show his mindset, what's going in his head, something like Zeke's, Reiner's or Erwin's backstory. We received none of it.

2) Titan's powers and its limitations. Or maybe lack of them. Why King Karl Fritz , did not use titan's powers to erase titan's powers from earth, like Ymir did in chapter 139? What stopped him or Ymir from doing so? Will of first king to rule and reproduce? No. Vow to renounce war was already against will of the first king to use the titans rule the earth, just like Zeke's order to sterilize all subjects of Ymir was against his order to reproduce. Yet, still Ymir chose to obey current user of royal's blood. How Eren was capable of travelling with his titans such great lengths, without being absorbed. How could he summon past titan's shifters? How falco could travel such great lengths with barely any training with his titan. What are limits of titans's powers? How could he delete memories of other titan's shifters or even Ackermans, if it was possible why did not Karl Fritz used that to subdue other Titan Warriors and Ackerman clan in order to bring peace to the world. Beside of that it also kills tension, because now Eren apparently has totaly broken, busted, OP arsenal at his disposal which can remove almost every obstacle and there is no place for him to find way to work with his powers despite its limitations.

3)Final Battle. Number one priority of alliance was to seize Eren and Zeke (they did not know that Ymir is on Eren's side). Instead they blow up his nape and nuke him. If he did not survive, all colossal titans would begin walk aimlessly and destroy everything in their path. Beside they should allow Falco join them when they were flying with Plane given only his Jaws were able to destroy coccon of Warhammer Titan.

If those 3 issues were resolved I would be very satisfied with ending and glaze Isayama for 10 years at least. But since nothing like that happened and I am spiteful, malevolent prick, in order to mald about something for next 10 years, I noticed (or other people noticed for me) other plotholes. Here we go.

1. Paths- the moment Ymir died or her body was devoured by her daughters her consciousness was transferred to Paths, where other shifters could enter and spend unlimited amount of time within them. Ymir also could create virtually everything withing Paths (though only bodies of titans could be transferred into real world) from chains to landscapes to bloody cabin for stepsisters. This is the problem. One of the dramas in the show was the fact that Titan shifters had limited lifespan to 13 years, but Paths breaks that limit by allowing them to live within world created by loli goddess with unlimited time (they do not appear to age) and have everything they may desire created by Ymir. Furthermore, there are more question if you can create everything why not use unlimited time and resources to conduct scientific experiments, to for example overcome Ymir's curse, create weapons to gain edge over your enemies, create stunning poetry, write books, etc. We see none of it, technology, culture (except women's rights) appears to moved at pace similar to our world.

2)How Eldian Empire collapsed (and functioned)- we are told that Karl Fritz engineered fall of Eldian Empire with Tybur Family, by fucking off to Paradise, leaving Noble houses without adult supervision and creating false legend about Marleyan hero Helos. It resulted in civil war which weakened noble houses and allowed Marleyans to pilfer might of Giants. Okay, First I assume that there are limits to Paths, to time you can spend in them and things (and their quality) Ymir can create within them. Also, Founder cannot erase memories of other shifters and is nerfed overall. There are few issues with that plan. noble Houses could create new balance of power and maintain that without murdering or weaking each other. There was also possibility that one or two clans could emerge victorious from struggle wielding multiple power of titans. There was possibility that Tyburs could use chaos to seize powers of titans for themselvs or that Titan powers after its users were killed were transferred to random subject of Ymir in its infancy, beyond of reach of Marley or Tyburs. Furthermore, Marleyans would have hard time snatching powers of titans from hands of their oppressors. Every colonial Empire used ""divide and rule"" approach and I am fairly confident given how Marley were oppressed, they were not given access to any high ranking positions and used as cannon fodder/labourer while other more loyal ethnic groups were given privileged positions. It would make seizing one titan power very difficult not speaking about 6. On the other hand, It is said that Eldian lans constantly warred for moar powah, and were kept in check by King, so it would be interesting how did it look? Was it some sort of ritualistic warfare, where winner did not kill opponent but instead seized part of his land? Were clans blood related to Fritzs and could control hordes of pure titans, then how Founders protected themselv from unified rebellion against their rule. Were head of clans not related to king  and used their titan powers to aid their conventional armies against their rivals? Where and for what exactly they were fighting given the fact that Eldia conquered entire planet, and therefore battles would be likely spread not only to Marley, but to entire planet?

3)Weird thing that succesors of Karl Fritz (and he himself) did. First Karl created 3 walls, each with small walled district. Why? He was not planning on repelling Marley invasion, was fine with his subject getting murdered, yet he created 3 (instead of two) walls as redundant system for something, alongside with districts that drew titans toward them and made it easier to containg potential breach. Furthermore, his succesors allowed to create army tailored against titans, with formations like bloody Survey Corp(se) with 3DMG. If Marley was to invade Island, there was possibility that well placed cannon shot could hit armoured titans in front of his neck which was unarmoured,kill him and soldiers capture other warriors. They get interrogated, spill beans, Survey Corp does coup, captures real king, Eldian Empire 2.0. Furthermore, there is Historia. Frieda cared for her, taught her how to write and read, good manners, yet always wiped off her memories and told to never leave boundaries of her farm as if she was protecting her from something. Later, Firm Assembly, council of nobles immune to memory wipe ordered Kenny's squad to kill Historia and her mother. Why Frieda did not tell them, if anything looks at Historia in funny way gets his position immiediataly revoked, why she did not adopt her or gave her more comprehensive protection given her status. I mean previous Kings could be quite intense, they were prosecuting Ackermans and people that were not subject of Loli. Furthermore, Alma was repulsed, almost terrified of Historia, as if her existence was danger to her life. Nobles that ordered to kill Historia were willing to risk Frieda's wrath, as if they were not afraid of her. It is werid given that while immune to memory wipes, they still could be quite easily killed by Frida in her Titan's form or stripped off their wealth by wiping off all memories of their servants and buisness partners. Why would Founder allow such risk by giving them such large power and influence within walls?

4)We do not know how world post Eldia's fall works. We do not know how Zeke managed to fool Marleyans that he has no royal blood, while creating conspiracy within state, that should wiretap every of his personal items (including toilet paper) and put 100 agents in his 3 kilometer radius. We do not know how Tyburs rule Marley or influence it or how much influence they actually have?

5)Why Annie (or Reiner or Burrito) killed Sony and Bean- pure titans and test subject of Hange. Why to alarm Survey Corp of existence of potential spies/saboteurs. Was Hange on verge of discovering some very important secret bout giants?

6)Paradise upper Brass, Armin and C.O got dumbed down. First they allow, POWs from Marley like Niccolo to work as servants during their important meetings (the one during which they discuss Historia and her farmer- okay let's call him hans- they discuss why Historia hooked up with Hans to avoid getting turned into titan) which allowed to spy on them (Edit. I want to point that Niccolo knew about wine with spinal fluid and was as well allowed to move freely within island, which likely allowed him to share gathered info with other conspirators), they discuss thier plans in presence of Hizuru (who are not the most trustworthy allies). But the dumbest thing they did was the fact they sent their two titan shifters into enemy territory, without sending any scouting party beforehand to check how secure area is to ... set up diplomatic mission to convince za warudo that Walldians are not the threat. Those two (Tatake Dude and Umida guy) should spend 48 hours per day, on shores of Island prepared to intercept any Marleyan scout vessel, while diplomatic/inteligence mission should be conducted by handpicked members of military police and garrison who had experience in undercover mission (against organised crime or tax evaders in island) alongside merchants, scholars and engineers in order to understand outside world. Not bunch of frontline soldiers. Especially, if two of those soldiers were 90% of military potential of Walldia, if Marley knew they were there, they'd be FUCKED.

Okay, this is for now, but I also have some nitpicking.

Namely in Guren no Yumiya there is mention of crimson bow and arrow (I presume they refer to colossal titans) and the dark sword and grit his teeth against destiny. Interesting, wished to know whether it was foreshadowing to original ending. Was Eren to get cool animay sword? Especially that in last opening the dark sword was also mentioned.",True,False,attackontitan,Plotholes and unresolved plotlines in ending and rest of AoT.,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/attackontitan/comments/1j4v6be/plotholes_and_unresolved_plotlines_in_ending_and/

So, last month, on December 5 (yes I remember the exact date), I decided to start watching AOT. This was my first time ever seeing it. My cousin highly recommended it to me. It is one of her favorite animes and she says it is amazing. She wanted to see it with me because she wanted to see my reaction, so while we FaceTimed or whenever we had the chance to see it together in person, we watched. Sometimes she couldn’t see episodes with me, but for the majority of the episodes, she was there on the FaceTime call watching my reaction.

Today she came over to my house so we could watch the last four episodes of Season 4. We watched until episode 87, which is before The Final Chapters, and I’ll explain why in a bit. So, here is what I think of the whole show so far:

Oh… my… gosh. This… this was… a rollercoaster. I have never seen a show like this before. I am just… mesmerized, absolutely stunned at how… I don’t even know!! This show is beautiful, sad, intense, violent, heartbreaking, heartwarming, interesting, shocking… everything all at once. This has got to be one of the BEST shows of all time. I have never seen any show like this. Seriously, OH MY GOSH. This show…!!!!

On the first episode, I was already hooked. I was absolutely intrigued. My cousin loved my face as I was watching it. I mean, I was impressed by how… amazing it looked! Just by the first episode, I already knew, this was gonna be good. And boy, I couldn’t stop watching it. Every time an episode ended, I would tell myself “Ok, that’s enough for tonight!” But nope, I’d just click the next one. I was THAT hooked and THAT into it. I couldn’t stop watching it, I just couldn’t!! This was amazing!! It IS amazing!! Every single episode and OVA were AMAZING experiences!! This was just… wow. Just wow.

Yeah honestly, I know I’m not really being specific in anything and I’m just rambling words, but that’s just how amazing it was that I can’t even find the right words for it and I can’t even talk properly. This was such an amazing experience. I don’t know how many times I have thanked my cousin for introducing this show to me. This is amazing. So amazing. I love Attack on Titan.

Ok so, why haven’t I seen The Final Chapters? Well, during my watch, I heard that a movie called The Last Attack was coming out. I saw that it was just the Final Chapters combined to make a full length feature presentation. I decided that I would watch until the episode 87 so that I can experience the Final Chapters for the first time on the big screen!! It’s honestly so awesome that this movie is coming out just in time that I am watching AOT for the first time! I am so excited to see it!!!

So yeah, I thought I could share on the AOT Reddit how much I absolutely loved this show!!! This show was absolutely AMAZING!! I loved it so much, I just can’t… THIS SHOW WAS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!

And now I’m so excited for The Last Attack!! This’ll be my first time watching the finale, and it’s on the big screen!!

Without further ado, let this shitshow begin.

# Introduction

First of all, I will be forthright and say I did not enjoy either the manga or anime endings from a narrative standpoint. The manga simply dropped the ball on the ending, and the anime did improve a few things, had phenomenal animation (Please give a hand to MAPPA), and stellar soundtracks. From a narrative standpoint, it also regressed in quite a few aspects. All in all, Episode 89/Chapter 139 didn't stick the landing in my opinion.

More importantly, I have noticed a disturbing rise in elitism and echo chambering within the community. Many people are making fun on manga readers for disliking the ending, while not understanding nor bothering to understand our own grievances, only making themselves look like idiots in the process. Something not exactly helped by a [certain subset of pretentious and rabid ending defenders](https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/)...

All that being said, I am ultimately expressing my own views and the views of others I've interacted with. I have no intention of disrespecting people who like the ending or the literary genius that is Hajime Isayama. At the end of the day, this series brought this community and countless others together. While I don't have the privilege of saying I have been here since 2009 or 2013, I think I have a right to an opinion having kept up for the series since 2020, over three years at this point.

# The War For Paradis Arc - Where the Cracks Began to Show

Before we start on addressing the Battle of Heaven & Earth Arc, I want to address the War for Paradis Arc, namely the issues that led up to this.

Firstly, the character relationships are handled extraordinarily poorly during this arc. Over the course of the arc, one would expect that the Warrior's actions during Seasons 1 through 3 would be addressed, or at least, addressed better than they were. This *doesn't happen.*

Reiner and Annie are never held truly accountable for their actions. Sure, it comes up every so often, but it's never given the proper time of day it deserves. Everyone comes together, agrees they need to stop Eren, and they do so. Completely ignoring past actions for the sake of forming the Dollar Store Avengers.

On top of that, there is never a proper character conflict with fighting their own people as well. The interaction between Armin, Connie, Samuel, and Daz is honestly too short for its own good and resolves too neatly. Hanji never struggles with killing the same people she was leading mere weeks earlier, and Mikasa is more than happy to hit those combos on the Jaegerists. After the battle, this never even really comes up again.

This is - of course - never summed up better by Connie and the Scouts first re-encounter with Annie. When Connie discovers Annie in the festival, his first thought isn't ""The Female Titan escaped"" or ""What is she doing here."" It's ""Yo everyone check this out Annie is eating pie."" Let's not forget, this is the same guy who was about to feed a 12-year-old child to a Titan, while his intentions were somewhat different, it is a complete tone shift that reduces what could've been a very tense and dramatic scene to a cheap comedy bit, something that becomes a recurring theme in the final episode.

While I'm not saying we need to spend ten episodes on it, a little more interaction addressing the very real issues between the cast would've drastically enhanced the story and provided vastly more development than what we actually had.

On top of that, there is also a ridiculous amount of plot armor, especially during the Battle of the Harbor. Tens to dozens of Thunder Spears are used on the titan shifters and rogue Scouts, and yet no one had the thought of firing them at the ship? On top of that, there were potentially over a hundred Jaegerists present against such a small force of Scouts and Marleyans yet no one is so much as scratched?

All in all, the arc is a mess, probably the second worst, right behind the Battle of Heaven & Earth, but it's forgivably bad.

# Diabolus Ex Machina at it's Finest, the Hallucigenia.

With all that being said, the Final Episode actually starts out decently, we are fresh from Hanji's death, the stakes are high, and everything is poised for the final showdown. This is it, the thrilling conclusion to a 14-year-long epic.

Within the context of the ending itself, I think everything started to go wrong when the Hallucigenia (canonically referred to as 'The Source of All Life' or 'Devil of All Earth', it is primarily called that due to its appearance in the Manga) appeared. To put it bluntly, the hallucigenia is Diabolus ex Machina at its finest. Eren has been nuked, the Rumbling has ceased, and it seems about ready to wrap up. Then it appears at the last second to continue the fight. To start up with, it's appearance in the entirety feels like a complete ass-pull.  This thing has never been mentioned and has never been seen with the exception of it appearing to re-attatch Eren's head all the way back during the War for Paradis Arc. There was never any mention of it.

Despite all of that, I still wouldn't have much of a problem with it, that is: if it hadn't gone and turned everyone into Titans. *This,* I believe, is where everyone's issue with the thing arises. Turning everyone aside from the Ackermans into Titans simply feels like a complete ass-pull of a move that happens for the sake of adding tension and re-igniting conflict, something which was already accomplished by Eren becoming a Colossal Titan. Everyone becoming Titans only to be de-shifted not even ten minutes later is shock value for shock value's sake and it cheapens the stakes of the battle.

Arguably, this effectively sums up the main issue the ending has, namely, everything that happens feels like either an asspull or is so blatantly inconsistent with established character arcs and personalities. Despite what EDs might claim, there is no lead-up or foreshadowing to its sudden appearance outside of it appearing to re-attach Eren's head, and it only exists for the sake of adding unneeded tension.

The hallucigenia - like so many other plot threads and established conventions - appears and disappears at Isayama's convenience, never foreshadowed and never explained. Just leaves the viewer with more questions than answers and a bad taste in their mouths.

# I'll See You Together In Hell (Thank You For Becoming a Mass Murderer for Our Sake)

Arguably the source of 90% of Ending Haters issues (and mine personally) comes from the scene with Eren and Armin talking in the Paths. As a hobbyist author myself, I can earnestly say I have never seen characters get shafted and shit on so badly yet so quickly as I did here. Within the span of about 5 to 10 minutes (give or take) 14 years, 138 manga chapters, and 88 episodes of character development were completely thrown out the window, and the entire story was inevitably flipped on its head.

First, as it turns out, Eren wasn't the one to free Ymir, Mikasa was, or at least according to Isayama. That's right folks, it was always Mikasa's story, Eren was just a side character.

What fucking bullshit.

My own feelings aside, this was a complete turnaround for the entire story. To put it simply, Mikasa does not get nearly enough development or foreshadowing for this to be the case. What does she actually do to warrant this? Why is Ymir waiting for her specifically, and not the boy who broke free of the restraints of her realm just to tell her she was free?

Sure, you can argue that Ymir empathizes with her inner conflict between her love for Eren and the need to kill him, but in that case, it doesn't make much sense either. She spends the majority of Season 4 pining after Eren, and she is still very clearly in love with Eren past his death, she hasn't moved on just like how Ymir's ""love"" for King Fritz keeps her trapped in the Paths. She still regularly visits Eren's grave and still wishes to see him again. There is nothing that we can see that indicates that Mikasa did anything to free Ymir. If anything, Mikasa is just as trapped as Ymir, clinging to Eren's memory even long after the Rumbling has ended, just like Ymir clings to Karl Fritz.

And so, like so many other things within this ending, only one answer can be given:

""Only Ymir Knows""

There is a reason this line is clowned on so much, because perfectly sums up the nature of the ending. So much goes unexplained, so many abandoned plot threads, things that only a god can know, and that god just so happens to be Ymir Fritz.

Speaking of Ymir Fritz, this is arguably one of the most poorly done plot threads in the ending. As it turns out, Ymir remained trapped in the paths for 2000 years because after all the horrible things King Fritz did to her and her family, cutting out her tongue, forcing her to bear his children, and then forcing those children to eat their mother?

Then Isayama spins it all around and reveals ""Oh, well as it turns out, Ymir Fritz was in love with Fritz because...Only Ymir Knows?""

Ignoring the sheer tone-deafness of this scene, it's completely out of left field from everything we have seen of Ymir Fritz so far (not like we have seen much of her). Ymir was built up as someone who was scared to move past King Fritz and seize control of her own fate, someone who despite all of her power, was ultimately trapped by nothing other than herself and her own fears and insecurities. Yet all of that is ultimately revealed to be due to some kind of twisted love?

Honestly, this shit reads like a 2000s romance novel written by a single thirty-year-old white woman. Or 95% of the content on Wattpad.

Moving on from the batshit insanity that is Mikasa and Ymir's characterization. I want to address the mess that is Eren's characterization in the Ending, or rather, the complete assassination of it.

Within the span of the Paths conversation, we never get a clear read on Eren's true motives behind the Rumbling. If the manga was too vague on Eren's motivation, then the anime gives him too many motivations. Armin asks or the question comes up every other minute, yet we seem to get a different answer every time. First Eren tells us: ""It's pre-determined, I can't do anything about it and I totally had to kill my own Mom"" then goes to ""Uh, well, this is actually my galaxy-brained 300 IQ definitely-not-Zero-Requiem plan to save Paradis by making you guys heroes - no wait, it was to end the Power of the Titans and save all Eldians"" to ""Actually, I'm a sadistic murderer who wanted to kill 80% of Humanity"" to ""Nah, I did it cause I'm stupid and don't deserve my power lol."" Maybe it's all of them, maybe it's none, but we will never know because like so many other things, it was left vague and unanswered.

I get what Isayama was trying to do. He's trying to portray Eren as teetering on the edge of sanity. Someone who, despite all the big talk and fronts he put up, hardly knows what is going on himself or why it's happening, and is kind of just going along with events as they happen. It would've been a good way to write Eren as well, someone who has completely lost sight of himself in his pursuit for freedom.

In theory.

The main problem is that not only is this side of Eren is never seen or led up too, the audience is actively dissuaded from thinking that this might be happening. Everything we see points to Eren and the Jaegerists being completely right about their situation. The world is on their ass, negotiating for peace has failed, and if they don't fight, they and everyone they love will die. Eren has the resolve and the situation around him seems to fuel it.

Yet now Isayama wants to completely out of left field and suddenly turn Eren into a scared and confused man-child, and in the process ruin what made Eren such a legend during the Marley and War for Paradis arcs. Despite the makeover and epic one-liners he hit all throughout the final season. We can still see the 15 year old kid that was screaming: ""I'll kill all the Titans"". At the end of the day, it's still Eren Jaeger, someone who knows what he wants, and is willing to fight to the end to get it. Someone who cares about his friends and comrades to the point of dying for them.

The person we see in this scene isn't. This is a wimp and a fraud, someone who doesn't know what the fuck they're doing and can't tell up from down or friend from foe. It ruins good character development for the sake of turning Eren into a massive bitch who doesn't know what he wants.

And, you know what - that would be alright too. A character doesn't need to be a chess grandmaster 100% of the time, and one could make a decent argument for this being a very compelling type of character in and of themselves. Someone who - for all their bravado - is virtually bullshitting their way through events to come out on top. Except Isayama doesn't even manage to stick the landing on that either. There have been some very well-written losers in fiction. People who deliberately subvert the Chessmaster stereotype. 

Let's take Yoshiyuki Tomino's Char Aznable from Mobile Suit Gundam, particularly Char's Counterattack. Now, he has already been analyzed far better than I ever could. But what I want you to take away from here is that he is something like what Eren should've been if Isayama had truly managed to stick the landing the way he wanted to. It does what the ending scene tried to do and failed. Rather than assassinating Char's character in the Char's Counterattack movie, Tomino uniquely humanized him and forced the audience to realize their magnificent bastard of an antagonist was nothing but a man-child with mommy issues. It was an unorthodox direction that both surprised viewers yet at the same time was years in the making. 

And this is where it differs, Eren in the finale isn't a well-written loser, rather than building on existing character development like Tomino did, Isayama turns Eren into someone unrecognizable to both the audience and his friends, and not in a good way on either count. Trying to tell the audience that this is what their protagonist amounts to within the span of a single scene isn't good writing, it just ruins a character for the sake of adding unneeded ""complexity"" and trying to make it run deeper than it needed to be.

That brings us to the most notorious part of this scene, ""For 10 Years At Least."" One of the many lines that have hit infamy amongst the community, the entire confession was - to put it simply - a hot mess.

Contrary to most Titanfolkers/Jaegerists, I actually shipped and genuinely enjoyed the EreMika ship and never really got on the EreHisu train. EreMika was always more developed to me and generally felt more relevant, EreHisu really struck me as more of a brother-sister relationship or something that was just meant to be relevant for the span of the Uprising Arc.

That being said, this is just pathetic. It's either Isayama trolling the audience for the final time or he just realized that he needs to actually do something with EreMika and pulls this out of the ass-hat at the very last second. He knows he's been playing the ""Will They, Won't They"" train for ages, so then he comes out and does this. Arguably, this scene and the ""For 10 Years At Least"" hits along the same line as the famous ""Lalah Sune was a woman who could've been a mother to me."" quote from Char's Counterattack, in the line of thinking that it's used to demonstrate just how fucking pathetic these characters are.

The difference between the two is that one carries a message and two series worth of development behind it, it is consistent and serves as an end to a major character's arc as themselves, no one else. The other comes as a fastball straight out of left field, completely subverting everything the rest of the series worked toward and turning a well-written character into a shitty man-child. Same concept, vastly different executions, development, and results.

# Muh Parallels!!! (or ""The 'Parallelism' of the Ending (And why it doesn't work)."")

One of the main arguments I see Ending Defenders unanimously utilize is that the ending is one giant meta-reference, that the real message was that no matter what, the cycle of hatred would always continue. And if you didn't derive this from the ending and think it was peak kino and then promptly began worshipping the ground Isayama walked on, then you're an idiot that didn't understand the story.

So it's rather ironic that by them attempting to show up everyone and call out people for ""not understanding the story"" they really only just show how little they understand it themselves. Let me put it in layman's terms:

***News Flash: ""Parallelism"" isn't an excuse for bad writing. And simply understanding what Isayama was trying to do doesn't make you a 900 IQ Galaxy-brain wizard with bragging rights over everyone else. It just makes you look like a fucking idiot.***

One of the main pieces of misinformation I have seen is that Ending Haters that we wanted everything to end cleanly, and for everyone to be shitting sunshine and puking rainbows. A lot of un/misinformed YouTubers and anime-onlys like MoistCritikal and KitoSenpai have taken to spreading this concept that simply isn't true. We don't hate the destruction of Paradis, we hate the fact that is was done in a montage that comes entirely out of nowhere.

In an earlier essay, I wrote around a year after the ending, I state that Isayama wrote himself into a corner the second he decided to actually activate the Rumbing, and I stand by that opinion. To put it bluntly, there was simply no way for the story to end cleanly at that point, the ending was practically pre-determined to be divisive whether the Jaegerists or Alliance won in the end. That being said, I now realize that isn't necessarily a bad thing, either ending could've worked out fairly well if it was executed better, regardless of audience opinion.

Key phrase: *If it was*

As it happened, the ending contradicts itself in its messaging and themes. Throughout the episode, Isayama seems to want to reinforce the idea of how important it is for everyone to understand each other and break the cycle of hatred. The last few scenes before the end credits seem genuinely uplifting, and - ignoring the incredulous levels of talk-no-jutsu Armin would have to pull offscreen - it wasn't all that bad, and seemed like a perfectly bittersweet way to end everything off.

Then once again, all of that gets thrown out the window in the span of a three-minute montage of Eldia developing, and then promptly getting destroyed. All that shit about understanding and not repeating the cycle? Fuck all of that, hatred is everpresent and the Titans are making a comeback. This is what your favorite characters dedicated their hearts for people.

The complete 180 is incredibly tone-deaf and exists for the sole purpose of fucking over the audience one last time. One minute, despite there being some lingering issues, everything seems to be looking up. Humanity is healing and peace doesn't seem like such an impossibility. The next we learn that everything was pointless in the end, Eldia was still destroyed at the end of the day, and - worst of all - Titans might return, repeating the cycle all over again.

It's not like these two messages are inherently mutually exclusive either. Returning to the Gundam examples, the series itself perfectly hits both nails on their heads. All of the Universal Century works together to demonstrate the good that can come out of understanding each other, while also hitting the downer of the cycle ultimately repeating and humanity making the same mistakes over and over.

The issue with the way Attack on Titan does it is how it comes out of nowhere. Many Gundam shows are inherently depressing, but they remain consistent with their themes throughout while also giving us some high notes. This just feels like Isayama is trying to be edgy for the sake of being edgy and cramming as many overarching themes and messages into the ending as possible to make it feel deep and emotional whether or not they are consistent with the story so far, only for them to - unsurprisingly - not mesh well and come out as a mess of face-heel turns.

Admittedly, the anime assuages the blow via its visuals making it apparent that this takes place in a far more far-flung era. People love to say that there is no real reason for us to believe it is the world coming for revenge on Eldia as Floch predicted, that it happened what could potentially be tens to hundreds of years in the future. But let me ask you this?

*What else are we supposed to think?*

Everything we have seen throughout the ending points to this being the case. The Jaegerists had seized control of Eldia, and it is highly unlikely that the rest of the world would simply reconcile with the island. There is nothing else for us to think, so it's so bitterly ironic when the same people who clowned on manga readers for having expectations and theories that weren't met are the same ones coming up with clearly contradictory theories. The entire montage itself feels like one giant ""Fuck You"" to the audience and its hopes, one last troll before it all ends for good.

Well played, Isayama. Well played.

# The Good, The Bad, and What Only Ymir Knows

The final section of my essay, I want to address the countless miscellaneous plot threads that went nowhere, bad characterization,  and plot holes that we saw in the ending, as well as the countless established conventions that got thrown out on a whim.

&#x200B;

* Historia: Historia is arguably one of the biggest examples of Isayama failing to deliver. First off,  ever since Season 3 Part 2, Historia has largely been relegated to the background, despite being a core character throughout Season 1 and 2 and the apex of Season 3 Part 1.  I get the feeling that Isayama simply...didn't know what to do with Historia past the Uprising Arc. Her character is rarely seen, and we suddenly find out that she has randomly decided to get pregnant for...what reason? It feels like Historia's pregnancy is not only how she wound up getting sidelined for the majority of Season 4, but also goes back on her character development entirely.  
Historia becoming Queen was developed as the apex of her character arc. Of her stepping out of the shadow of the Reiss family and finally gaining the strength to live for herself and not simply adhering to the pressure of others. And yet she goes and does exactly that by having this child. It's as if we're still watching Krista Lenz and not Historia Reiss, another character assassination, albeit much longer in the making.  
Then there is the matter of Historia's child. Throughout Season 4, the child is alluded to multiple times as being something more in the grand scheme of things. I'm not saying that the child was somehow set up to be Eren and Historia's bastard child, but simply that it was meant to be more relevant than it was, and yet towards the end this plot thread, like Historia's character, ends up going absolutely nowhere.  

* Titan Inheritance and the Death of All Titans: One of the majorly under-talked-about plotholes is how titan inheritance actually works, or more specifically, what happens when a shifter dies. Throughout the show, characters state multiple times that if a shifter dies without being inherited, their power will pass on to a random Eldian baby. Yet when Eren is killed, his death simply *ends* the Power of the Titans entirely.  
Once again, this is an example of an idea that is good in theory but failed to stick the landing. If we had been explained that the Founder was somehow different, or if it was foreshadowed that killing the Founder meant ending Titans forever, then Eren dying and ending Titan powers would make sense.   
However, now, not only is Eren dying and ending Titan powers simply an asspull, but it also contradicts already known rules within the story with little to no explanation as to why or how. What made Eren so special that him dying defied laws that existed for thousands of years in lore? Only Ymir Knows.

# Conclusion

First off, before I end this essay and before I allow the ED echo chamber to take over the comments. I'd like to say that I genuinely did enjoy the ending to an extent. MAPPA did a phenomenal job and gave it the royalty treatment it deserved. The soundtrack was amazing, the animation was amazing, the action sequences and choreography are well done, all of it is excellent. It's simply that narratively, we as manga readers can't engage with the ending on the same level that the majority of the fandom seems to want us to.

Secondly, I'd like to call out on the sudden uptick in actively toxic content towards manga readers. It's as if every sub that isn't Titanfolk has suddenly turned into an Attack on Retards clone. It feels like for the past three days since the ending came out there has been nothing but a constant stream of low-effort toxicity clowning on Ending Haters and manga readers for the vaguest or dumbest of reasons. And it's not only on Reddit, but Twitter and Instagram too and - hell - even YouTube seems to be jumping on the train. This is the same type of behavior that r/titanfolk and the former r/yeagerbomb get accused of, yet when 90% of the Fandom starts doing it it's not a problem and only the minority are the issue?

I'm not saying that everyone should agree with me in hating the ending, the anime ending did quite a few things right to its own credit, and ultimately I'm not here to disparage anyone else's opinions, merely share my own. At the end of the day, Hajime Isayama is the writer, neither you and I know what he or his editors were thinking when this came out, and we might never know. So to say that someone ""doesn't understand the material"", it not only insults their intelligence, but that of a truly talented author as well.

Finally, I'd like to take the time to say that it has been a truly good run. No matter how you feel about the ending, I think we can all agree and say that we truly love the place Attack on Titan has brought us. In an era where hyper-marketability is the norm and trash content is actively rewarded, Attack on Titan will remain as a truly amazing show for all time.

Also, I don't talk anything about the non-adapted chapters of the manga-- this post is mainly about the anime. Sasageyo!\]

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Back in 2009, a young Hajime Isayama published a story about enormous walls and man-eating giants. It soared in popularity, and in 2013, at a time when *Sword Art Online* taking the world by storm, WIT Studio's adaptation of *Attack on Titan* made its debut.

This show got me hooked from Episode One, and ever since I've been passionately watching each season and reading every chapter in the past seven years (four of those years were in wait for Season 2, mind you), admiring its story, listening to its soundtrack, and analyzing its characters.

This post is gonna talk about what I think makes the show so amazing, and it's gonna go down like one of those click-bait articles or WatchMojo countdowns where I go through each topic, one-by-one, starting with:

&#x200B;

**1. The Music**

Hiroyuki Sawano's OST perfectly complements the show's atmosphere, from the badass tempo of Rittai Kidou to the emotionally-charged anthem that is You See Big Girl. I don't think the moments in the show would have as much impact without the OST accompanying it.

&#x200B;

[you can HEAR this image](https://preview.redd.it/0d335ijz4dy41.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29624e67de0ce95062a712e1507405205e9da47a)

Eren's mother's death set the tone of the entire show, giving us a shocking welcome to Paradis-- and Vogel im Kafig could not have better accentuated the emotions of this scene. It's what traumatized Eren and drove him on in all of his future decisions.

So many other emotional scenes in this show have the perfect OST to accompany them: Levi Squad vs the Female Titan, the Colossal and Armored Titan scenes, the Smiling Titan reveal-- Sawano's music carries those scenes *every single time babeyy*.

Not only does the music really sell those scenes, but the phenomenal voice acting does as well, in every dub: Japanese, English, even German! *Seriously, look up the German Eren and Reiner argument and German Mikasa dub-- you'll love to see it.*

I think the *Attack on Titan* soundtracks are some of Sawano's best work. I have his music and the opening themes on queue in Spotify whenever I'm reading the manga or exercising--

*and seriously, this stuff makes anything you do at least 78% more intense.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**2. The Characters**

The characters are so well written-- despite living in a world of supernatural powers and creatures, all characters in the show have REAL backstories, REAL emotions, and REAL motivations-- they're not just NPCs or fodder, but real people. You can really imagine that this world could have happened in an alternate timeline, if Titan-powers were real.

Everything feels human. If you go back to watch Carla's death, you'll notice that right before she dies, she says, ""Don't go..."" to Eren and Mikasa. She's not just an idealized, self-sacrificing mother-character that will drive the plot, but she was a real human being with real fear and real reactions before she died.

Every character we meet throughout the series has the chance to develop a fleshed out, grounded personality, and each character has a reason why they act the way they do.

You got characters like Christa, who start out as your typical cutesy-anime girl-- everyone called her a perfect Goddess-- but she reveals why she acted like that and really comes out into her own later on in the story-- she becomes a real, flawed person with history and motivations.

Even Levi, Humanity's Strongest, a perfect soldier who can kill you in 47 different ways before you even hit the ground... *he's 5'4""*\-- and he's self-conscious about it too; he's not perfect!

The villains, as you'll meet later on in the series, aren't truly evil, either-- they're just people doing what they think will help them survive. They don't truly enjoy human suffering, but it was to protect what was important to them. The psychology behind why they act the way they do and how they must be thinking or feeling is one of the most interesting parts of the show.

[seriously, this girl went from 0 to 100 reaal quick](https://preview.redd.it/xxadvkf25dy41.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d402caecffede1ab19717b0f7a7b22ad8c0bd878)

Also, the characters' appearances are well-designed as well. It goes to show that you don't need to have wacky proportions or unnatural hair or eye colors to make a character distinct. I think the strangest hair we've seen is Rico Brzenska's white-hair or Nifa's pink hair-- but everyone has natural, realistic hair tones and facial features; it's really appealing.

There's tons of inspiring men and women in AoT, too-- they're not overly-muscular or sexy fan-service-- but real people, I can't say that enough!

&#x200B;

Some of my personal faves are Sasha, Jean, and Grisha-- learning all of their stories and struggles was such a treat to watch, and it felt realistic, like I was watching the lives of real people and their problems.

* Sasha's quarrel with her upbringing and her reality, how she has to give up her closed-minded attitude when she leaves home and suppress of her personality by hiding her accent and speaking politely
* Jean's internal conflict between doing what best interests him and doing what's right, what other's depend on him for, when choosing to join the Scouts instead of the MP
* Grisha's relationship with his father and his sons, how parents influence their children for better or for worse

I can see a part of myself in each of these characters; and despite never going through what they've gone through, I feel like their struggles and decisions are something anyone might face in reality.

Isayama really poured his soul into these characters, and it shows in their development as the story progresses. Not only do the characters progress, but so does:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**3. The Art**

The evolution of Attack on Titan's art-style is like a time-capsule of Isayama's experience as a manga artist-- it's so inspiring to open up the old volumes and see the difference between Chapter 3 and Chapter 103.

&#x200B;

[like wtf, mr. isayama got so good at drawing](https://preview.redd.it/1mi0cqbb5dy41.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d248c0c97a4776d8a6554b1a0da11cab02978c7a)

Even a pro like Isayama is constantly pushing forward and improving when it comes to anatomy, shading, and line-art, just like his story is.

&#x200B;

I've studied AoT's style a bit when I draw fanart of its characters, and feel that the facial expression is a key part of the style's distinctiveness.

You've got the huge anime-eyes that every other show has, but the particular choices of lines that the artists add so much emotion and depth, it's like the character's terror, or rage, and determination bleeds out of the page-- seriously, take a look at the peoples' intense faces next time you get a chance.

The art-style isn't like any other work I've seen-- it feels like an anime-styled take on The Walking Dead comic's gritty realism-- definitely a cool combination.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**4. The Atmosphere**

Speaking of The Walking Dead-- I loved the apocalyptic feel of AoT back in Season 1 and 2-- the sheer dystopia of the idea that the last of Humanity was trapped in the walls by an almost invincible enemy. It made it feel like every time the Titans pushed forward-- every time a soldier or civilian died-- it was a devastating loss for all of Humanity. It's what made the Victory at Trost so uplifting.

Remember after Eren sealed the Wall with the boulder back in Season 1, the very next episode switched the OP from Guren no Yumiya to Jiyuu no Tsubasa? Those triumphant brass chords at the beginning, the faint cheers of a victorious crowd in the background, the patriotic image of the Wings of *Freedom--* it was such a moving piece. I live for those feelings!

&#x200B;

There's also an air of mystery to the show that I think everyone loved. Theorizing on what was in the Basement, the history of the Titans and the Walls, even what was going to happen in the next episode was so thrilling!

&#x200B;

[the bane of my existence](https://preview.redd.it/2wssbn3k5dy41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=facae923aa29ac4e94da1eb6c19be9e3d37d6846)

It isn't like any Shonen anime I've ever seen before. You don't have simple idealism like ""I'm gonna be the best hero ever!"" or ""I'm gonna be the strongest there is!"" **These are people who are just trying to SURVIVE in this world, to find out the truth and escape their situation.**

* You see it in characters like **Levi**, who just wanted to escape the Underground and live a better life but had to lose everyone he cared about to do it--
* in **Jean**, who just wanted to live comfortably as an MP but decided to sacrifice his well-being to do the greater good--
* in **Armin**, who wanted to see the ocean and find out that there was more to the world in the walls and joined the Scouts to do it--
* and in **Eren**, who wanted to reclaim the world from his oppressors, no matter who they were, and will have to  \[redacted\] to do it.

&#x200B;

These characters have to make insane life-or-death decisions each episode-- not just for themselves, but for their comrades. The stress would cripple any other person, but these characters have the strength to act, and that's what makes it interesting for us to watch.

&#x200B;

[Girls: \\""Boys never have to make difficult decisions!\\""     Boys:](https://preview.redd.it/f4lgkpdm5dy41.jpg?width=1365&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21ae619d93f6754b3e08be1cfde5857179508669)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**5. Isayama's Philosophy**

As simple as the messages may be, they're really intriguing to think about and are so poignant when tied with scenes of people fighting for their lives. There's so many inspiring quotes throughout the series, I can't believe Isayama thought up of all of them:

* ""You can't change anything unless you can discard part of yourself too. To surpass monsters, you must be willing to abandon your humanity""
* ""If you win, you live. If you lose, you die. If you don’t fight, you can’t win! So fight. Fight. Fight!""
* ""I can believe in my own abilities or the choices of the companions I trust. But no one ever knows how it will turn out. So choose for yourself, whichever decision you will regret the least.""
* ""You know, if you can't cut the nape, you can always shove one of these swords up their asses.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**6. The World**

Even before the Basement, Hajime Isayama's world-building was amazing-- I was so invested in the lore and history while watching the show. Each group and organization, who's a part of each of them, who their enemies and allies are-- the faction-interaction was so interesting to watch, because it reminded me of how groups interacted in our own world history.

I remember back in 2013, it was so fun trying to pinpoint the time-period of the show before the Basement, and all of its aesthetic features: the 20th century clothes and furniture, the 19th century technology like horses and rope-and-pulley systems, the culture's Germanic influence in its names and architecture-- it was such a unique combination that was so fascinating.

*Also it was fun to hear Japanese-pronunciations of Germanic names... Beh-ru-tol-to*

With all the shows set in fantasy worlds, in alternate realities, or in modern-day, the futuristic/steampunk aesthetic seen in the flare guns and ODM gear made the show distinct in its own right. On the topic of the ODM gear...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7 and 8. The ODM Gear and Animation**

Yep, the Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear-- no, the *Vertical-Maneuvering Equipment*\-- no, the *3-Dimensional Maneuvering Gear*\-- gets its own segment.

I can write a whole post on how cool the ODM gear is; it's such a cool idea--

From an animation standpoint, Attack on Titan's ODM gear allows for so many cool action-scenes! It opens up a whole new dimension of mobility, removing the restriction of the ground and essentially allowing the animators to draw characters in all angles. This opens up for more possibilities-- more places for characters to go, more tactics they can employ, more threats they have to worry about.

&#x200B;

[Sure, a sword fight on a two-dimensional plane is cool enough-- but a sword fight in three-dimensional space? That shit's galaxy-brained dude](https://i.redd.it/sm3laddq5dy41.gif)

When you see an ODM master like Levi in action-- it's impossible not to be amazed.

WIT Studio's ODM scenes are masterpieces-- and I'm practically watching these sequences everyday, both admiring and studying the animation.

&#x200B;

From a mechanical engineering standpoint, the ODM gear is so amazing-- you see other grapple hooks all the time: Batman's wire gun, the Legend of Zelda's hookshot, Spider-man's web shooters, but I feel that Attack on Titan does the grapple hooks just right.

You got the semi-realistic laws of physics that are going into the detail of how the device operates, like how the gas propels the wires, how the harnesses distribute weight across the body, and how the hooks engage and retract with the hydraulic triggers-- it all feels like it can be created in real life, with enough research.

You also got the years of training it takes to master this piece of equipment, which allows for amazing displays of athleticism and reflexes-- it's also an excuse to give all the characters rippling 12-packs--

&#x200B;

[I thought only the Armored Titan could have abs of steel...](https://i.redd.it/s369l9ix5dy41.gif)

&#x200B;

Sidenote: There's a character in Rainbow Six Siege called Amaru-- she's an anti-terrorist operator who has a grappling hook that pulls her up much like the ODM gear. The devs at Ubisoft even code-named her *The Attack on Titan Operator* during her development. I think it's cool that this show's technology is still inspiring other work in video games.

&#x200B;

From a storytelling standpoint, I feel like the ODM gear represents freedom. It literally allows the user to fly, the ultimate freedom of movement, and kill Titans, the ultimate enemy.

A Titan, as a creature, is such a powerful force-of-nature that if they were in our world, there would be no way for the average person to counter it. With something like zombies, we could just vibe-check it over the head-- with any other monster, use a gun. If that don't work, *use more gun.* But no amount of guns would even put a dent in a Titan-- those guys regenerate-- they huge-- they kill indiscriminately-- it's literally like fighting a god.

The ODM gear allows its user to physically go toe-to toe with these gods. It's essential. Cannons and guns are largely ineffective, but a blade to the nape kills every time.

I feel like we often forget how much the world in the walls relies on this tool to survive. Even Levi, as physically-powerful as he is, can't do jack to a Titan without gas or blades.

With the ODM gear, these characters gain the power to rise up, figuratively and literally. And you can see this power in the characters themselves. Not only does the ODM gear training send their body to peak fitness, much more fit than any non-ODM-trained individual, but their mentality has changed too-- they have the training and confidence to take on their challenges head-on, and that's inspiring to watch.

This is gonna sound is super techno-phile, but I feel like the whole show hinges on the existence of the ODM gear technology. Without it, Humanity would have been long gone, there would be no Attack on Titan, no cool fight scenes, nothing.

I even think the success of the show itself was partly because of the entertaining idea of flying around like Spider-man-- it's an appealing idea!

&#x200B;

[I really wish these were real... aside from the whole-- breaking-your-back-from-the-unrealistic-force-of-the-grappling-hooks thing](https://preview.redd.it/teros8v06dy41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbda062241591a94c812d97854f701c7c49de5a)

There have already been scenes of Humans-vs-Humans using the ODM gear, and there will soon be more of those scenes-- and when those scenes happen I want you to remember how pivotal the ODM gear is to Eldia's success.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9. Rewatchability**

During this hiatus between Seasons 3 and 4, if you go back and rewatch past seasons, there's foreshadowing that you'll only notice the second time. Seriously-- they bring back side characters, hide subtle clues and hints about others, and add little details and lines of dialogue that gain a whole new meaning when you get the context later on.

Like, I didn't know Instructor Shadis was gonna ever pop up again after the Training Arc, but lo and behold, he's needed in Season 3, and with it he adds a whole new depth to those Training episodes.

Each Season is made of like 10 hours of content-- you can fit a lot of detail in that time.

It makes the whole show feel connected and deliberately orchestrated, and it's definitely entertaining to see the technical storytelling that Isayama's masterfully employing.

You have works like Dragon Ball Z where the story is written as it goes on (and the Saiyan, Frieza, and Cell sagas are amazing, don't get me wrong), but I love that Isayama planned out what he wanted to do before he even started writing-- it makes everything come full circle and it's so satisfying.

Take a scene like Eren's flashback of Grisha back in Episode 9, when he was protecting Armin and Mikasa from that cannonball. Upon first viewing you're like-- what? It doesn't make sense.

Why did Grisha inject Eren with something-- was that the Titan power? Where did Grisha even go after that? How come Eren doesn't remember what happened, and how does his Titan power work?

All these answers are revealed later on in the story-- and it makes watching this scene so astonishing to watch after you know the answers. Same goes for scenes after the Basement. The whole world opens up, and your eyes are opened to the true nature of the world within the walls. It makes you realize that everything was planned-- *the game was rigged from the start.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Looking back to the show's beginning, to 2013, I'm kind of looking back at myself at that time. In 2013, I was in middle-school, and the only anime I'd watched before that were Dragon Ball Z parodies, Sword Art Online, and Pokemon. It was horrifying for me and my friends to watch this gory show, entertaining to play the Attack on Titan Tribute Game, and interesting to talk about the plot and characters, but eventually we moved on.

Many moved on from the show during that long gap between Seasons 1 and 2, but we kept it in the back of our minds until Season 3 released. Finally, all the answers were revealed, we reached the Basement, we took back Wall Maria, and we finally got a glimmer of freedom.

In 2020, Attack on Titan is an entirely different story from the one we were introduced to in 2013. So much has changed in the past seven years, both for the show and in real life (hell, it feels like we're trapped within walls ourselves now cooped up inside with this whole world-wide \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*) that it feels like we're living in an entirely different world than a decade ago.

As the manga comes closer and closer to its finale, and as the Final Season approaches its release date, it's fun to look back at how far this series has come. From its realistic characters, to its passionate music, to its incredible story, and to its amazing animation-- everything about the show has changed. We're a long way from those days when we were making those funny *Marco-Half* and *The Walls protect the Titans from Levi* jokes. Now there's an entire world out there with new obstacles.

For Mikasa, Armin, and the others, the world just got a whole lot bigger. There are gonna be a lot of things that happen in the next coming months that the audience will love, and things that the audience will hate, but in the end those things will drive the plot to a close-- they will keep pushing forward, until the story comes to an end.

After everything in Attack on Titan wraps up this fall-- and after some time passes-- this show will feel like a distant memory, a thing of the past.

Before it does, I just wanted to record everything I love about this series and express my admiration and gratitude for the animators, the writing and production crew, the voice actors, the composers, the publishers, and the author who brought this story to life and released it to the world back in 2013.

1.-Let's agree that the series is not very rich in ships or romantic relationships... But in the end, this series is very realistic and of course there are complex romantic feelings and relationships between some characters even if that does not appear in the manga.
2.-It is very stupid that you say that Eren marries freedom or that the ships do not exist or this nonsense because the relationships exist between many characters even if the hints are not clear...
3.-So I want to clarify why the healthy relationship is erehisu and not eremika..
First of all, what some people do not understand is that human sociology is based on understanding and intellectual harmony before anything else..
4.-And Not just superficial feelings that will evaporate with time, because feelings change but understanding does not.
5.-So we will take the relationship on several axes:

-Eren and Mikasa's affection
-Eren and Mikasa's understanding
-Eren and Historia's understanding
-Eren and Historia's affection
-The importance of the relationship between Eren and Historia and its impact on the events...

6.-From the first chapter we will find that the nature of the relationship between Eren and Mikasa is a very one-sided emotional relationship... Because simply Mikasa is a very emotional person and what moves her most are feelings, even if they are superficial feelings...

7.-So we find that most Eremika fans rely only on the nature of the overwhelming emotion in the relationship, or that they are cute, for example, because Mikasa's overflowing feelings towards Eren are clear, and he also has some incomprehensible feelings for her.

8.-Because as I said above, feelings can change from the easiest thing, and that's what actually happened later, but understanding creates a strong bond and a healthy, cohesive relationship between the two in which there is integration and harmony.. Mikasa doesn't understand Eren

9.-She admitt herself that she was seeing a side of Eren that wasn't there.. and she asked herself.. Was Eren really like this all the time or was I the one who was intentionally seeing another side of him and ignoring the nature of his personality.
And of course Eren didn't change

10.-The evidence is the first situation between them, he killed 3 thieves without mercy and called them animals and said to her whoever takes away his freedom, I will take away his freedom..
That means Eren is one all the time, but she is the one who did not understand him.

11.-Therefore, we see that as soon as Eren understood the truth, she did not accept it and said, “I will go with the alliance to stop him and bring back the old Eren.” This means that she still wants the Eren of her imagination and is still unable to accept the real Eren.. and her feelings towards him began to fade, starting from when she took off the scarf and began to accept that she had to kill him and get over this stage..

12.-In the end, when she failed to get over the old Eren and understand the real Eren for who he really is...She decided to create another one in her imagination so that she could overcome her shock at the real Eren..
And that she really did not understand Eren and when she finally managed to understand him, she did not accept him as he was..

13.-This means that all her emotions were based on a false foundation and were directed at another person created by her imagination. Therefore, her emotions here have no value.And thus all the emotions were gradually fading and she began to separate from him completely and surpass the real Eren, but she was still in the old prison of Eren in her imagination..

14.-As for the other axe, which is the axe of understanding between Eren and Mikasa... we find that Mikasa never understood it from the first chapter.She did not understand his ambition and dreams, and in the first episode we see her hitting Eren hard in the face, knocking him to the ground because he made it clear to her and Armin the extent of his ambition and that he wanted to eliminate all the Titans.

15.-As for Mikasa, because she sees Eren as a weak emotional person, she could not understand that he is able to achieve this ambition and that he is stronger than she imagines.And then we see that Mikasa always saves him physically throughout the 3 seasons... but she never saves him morally... on the contrary.

16.-There is no understanding between them.. From the first chapter to the last chapter, there is only one dialogue between them.. And it is a dialogue in which she finally tries to understand his psychological suffering in the second season while he is screaming after Hannes' death.The reason was her physical weakness.. So finally she decided, instead of saving him physically as usual, without thinking about his feelings or ambition, to give him a moral boost and understand his psychological suffering, not his physical one.

17.-But this dialogue was only caused by her physical weakness.. but because this did not happen and will not happen again, there will never be any communication between them again.. because as long as she is able to protect him physically, she will not understand him psychologically.That's why Eren told Mikasa that the Mikasa he knew died at the age of 9, the day she gained the Ackerman ability and physical strength.This is what severed the bond between them, unlike Mikasa's OVA, in which she understood Eren, talked to him, and appreciated his ambition, because she did not gain the power of Ackerman in this OVA.

18.-And the day she gained her strength she lost her psychological ability to understand others especially Eren Maybe if she had not gained the Ackerman power there would have hope for forming a healthy relationship or there would have been a psychological and moral understanding.Her strength as an Ackerman makes her a slave to her own strength and destroys any bridges of psychological communication between her and others, and her communication is limited to physical and bodily communication only.So Mikasa never understood Eren's responsibility towards the island, his ambition for freedom, and his way of thinking.

19.-How did he become psychologically disturbed after seeing the memories and the future and realizing that the past will never return and he only has to move forward.So he asked Louise to burn the scarf to free Mikasa from this imaginary relationship and break the false bond that connects him to her.He showed her the truth about Ackerman to free her from the control of physical force over her thoughts and the flattening of her feelings and psyche...Because this power prevents her from communicating psychologically and morally and from using her mind more than her physical strength.. Therefore, there is never any understanding between Mikasa and Eren..

20.-Now let's move on to the second and most important part...which is the relationship between Eren and Historia.First of all, the emotion between Eren and Historia. We see that Eerehisu's relationship was not emotional or a romantic relationship in adolescence. Rather, it was a rational relationship with links of understanding and psychological and intellectual integration between the two.We see that their relationship arose and developed correctly, and it is not a random relationship that suddenly resulted from one situation only.

21.-The beginning of their relationship was with the coup arc, where Eren and Historia were the focus of this arc.. In this arc we find many dialogues between Eren and Historia and they are completely alone and at the table as if they were engaged lol. Historia was very depressed about Ymir's departure and that no one would love her and accept her as Historia because she was hated and afraid of being denied by the outside world, so she pretended and became Krista.

22.-But after Ymir's death, there was the only person who admitted his admiration for her true personality, which was Eren, and that he could easily understand her psychology and that she just needed someone to tell her that she was normal and not a god.She never expected that there would be someone who would accept her, love her, and admire her true personality as she is. But Eren turned out to be there, and from here Hiso started to love him.Eren was impressed by her real, natural personality, so the attraction between them was clear. And Historia, after Eren told her that he was impressed by her real personality, decided to show herself as Historia, whether the world accepted her or not.

23.-Indeed, she left the pretense and lived like Historia and became a queen and was encouraged to live her real life after his words.Erin's words gave her inner happiness and hope that there were still people who loved her for who she really was. It was clear that Erin had saved her from the psychological state and depression she was going through.At the time of the cave episodes, Eren was at the lowest point psychologically and all he wanted was death because he had entered the most severe types of depression and psychological pain...But at that time, the one who encouraged him, gave him hope, and saved him psychologically, and made him feel that he had value and importance in life, was Historia. You see how the two of them saved each other ""psychologically.""This is very similar to his mother saving him psychologically when he felt inferior and not special during his conversation with Keith Shadis.",False,False,attackontitan,"The nature of the ships in aot, a thread by @the_ usurper845.

1. Eren’s ’For 10 years at least’ speech
I’m not one of those people that hate when a character isn’t a stoic badass. But I believe there is a sharp contrast between Eren’s Ch 131 breakdown and his Ch 139 breakdown. Eren crying in front of Ramzi is depicted super well, and we as the audience feel for him, especipally how it’s spliced between scenes of the thousands of innocents being slaughtered. Obviously he would be devastated over being forced to destroy humanity, being extremely depressed over it. However, him breaking down to Armin makes no sense for his character. Whenever we’ve seen Eren cry, it’s usually over his loved ones or his failure to save them (his Mom, Hannes, Armin S3), but this moment is none of that. Instead, he cry’s over a woman that he has shown only slight romantic attachments towards (despite most of the show he yells at her, hits her, treats her like shit, and at many times seems to only like her as a sister). I honestly believe this scene was made to humiliate eren, being further supported by Armin’s comment on how pathetic what he just said was

2. Annie not facing any punishment:
I think Annie had the potential to be a very interesting character, having her story be having to make amends for doing those terrible things back in S1, especially to Levi’s squad. Instead of having that, her character instead has zero remorse to her actions, doesn’t apologize to anyone, and is instead thrown in so Armin can have some cheap, last-minute romantic tension. Everyone else kind of just forgets her action (like Connie laughing at her for eating pie, even though the last time he saw her she had a human yo-yo)

3. Eren’s motives switching;
The whole point of Eren’s character was that he was a symbol of hope to others. No matter what anyone told him, no matter what happened, he almost always stayed determined to keep moving forward to reach his goal of freedom. Throughout the entire series he pursued freedom. First it was to free the world of titans and free himself from the guilt of his mother dying. Then it became the freedom to explore the outside world. Then the freedom to live without fear of being exterminated from the outside world. Throughout the entirety of season 4, up until the final few episodes, Eren’s goal was to activate the rumbling to keep the people of Paradis safe from genocide. This unfortunately came at the cost of commuting his own genocide, but it showed how far he’d go for freedom. This idea that he was just acting the entire time, even in his internal monologues is such a total retcon and is a slap in the face to anyone who understood his character. When Armin begs Eren to stop in the paths, Eren saying that it’s already predetermined implies that everything in the show is being influenced, and Eren has no choice, meaning Eren was never free. Him being perfectly fine with that makes no sense, as he is not the type of character to give up

4. Historia being sidelined
Historia is one of the best female characters in AOT. Her growth from being a scared girl afraid tho choose sides, who wouldn’t mind dying if she was told, to a determined leader and queen is amazing writing. Her and Ymir’s relationship is one of the best in anime history in my opinion. However, Historia is completely ruined at the end. Most of the story, she is set up to be a direct parallel to the founder Ymir. Having Mikasa be the important one makes no sense character-wise, as the only thing the two have in common is loving someone who doesn’t love them back (at least until it was revealed that Eren did love Mikasa). Instead, Historia just becomes a figure head, allowing herself to have the child of some random nobody, and have her character do absolutely nothing.

5. Having the Story Be a Loop
Eren stopped at 80% because he wanted the other 20 to view his friends as saviors for stopping him (this plan is already flawed, but not so terrible). Showing that Paradis was destroyed by the outside world years later anyway means that Eren’s plan was completely useless, also making the Rumbling unnecessary. That’s not to say that having Paradis get destroyed is bad, but it could’ve been written much better (I’ll explain how at the end). Showing that child come across the tree implies he’ll become the next Ymir. This means that everything in the story will start over, and they will be stuck in an endless loop.

What I would’ve done
Obviously, many people like how the show ended. I’m not claiming to be a better author than Isyama and despite my disliking of the ending, the fact he was able to write 130 chapters of absolute peak is amazing.

Firstly, Eren is tThe father of Historia’s child. This wasn’t done out of romantic interest (historia will always love Ymir, and Eren will always love Mikasa) but out of necessity to keep Historia from becoming a Titan. Eren goes through with the rumbling 100%. Floch and Hange still die, and nearly all of Eren’s friends hate him for what he’s done. He still gets rid of their Titan power. Even Mikasa, who loves Eren, still can’t forgive him for his atrocity and leaves him behind. This and Historia’s child being born break the curse of Ymir. Eren lives away from everyone else, with only Historia occasionally visiting him, understanding what it’s like to be the worst in the world. 

Eventually, Paradis does get destroyed, but it’s due to an inner conflict, still getting across the fact that the cycle of war will never end, while also being an irony. The civil war causes all of humanity to perish, but Eren and his friends during their time were still free",True,False,attackontitan,Things I disliked in the Attack on Titan ending,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/attackontitan/comments/17p8h99/things_i_disliked_in_the_attack_on_titan_ending/

I was exploring some of the AoT wikis, mainly going through side character articles. Eventually, I read through the article about the Yeagerists as a refresher. Under ""notable members,"" it included... RICO?? I was thinking ""there's no way I didn't notice her at all, right?""

I double checked and she only pops up in one of the final panels of the manga, only after the Yeagerists take full control of Paradis' military (image below).

[You can notice her in the bottom right of the panel.](https://preview.redd.it/ciy722orcg8d1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=028f5f33f99b2c712ea44a9e8d08e7ba186165e7)

While the same panel features Hitch, a character that many (including me) believe she only celebrates Paradis' new military here out of fear rather than actual support, I can see Rico being actually invested in the Yeagerists and their ideals.

From her limited screentime, there are a couple of reasons one (me... pretty much me) can draw up for Rico's future support of Eren.

Way back in the Battle For Trost arc, Rico and several Garrison soldiers defend Eren’s titan as he moves towards the gate in order to plug the hole with a boulder. Before the encounter, Rico reminds Eren about the stakes of his mission, telling him that many will die to protect him.

After the hole is sealed, Rico fires a green flare to indicate the mission's success. She is moved to tears, indicating that Eren lead humanity in their first triumph over the titans and that her comrades did not die in vain.

Rico is shown to be reserved in her emotions, mainly being analytical in her reasoning (I've noticed that her line of thinking is very similar to Floch's). This is the only moment we see this emotional side of her. This historic moment would have to have some great effect on Rico.

Ok, here's the real meat of my thought process: How could she be used in Season 4.

For one, I think she could be featured (at least in the background) way more, obviously. I can take or leave the idea of her participating in the raid on Liberio.

We know that at least some of the Garrison members were featured in the attack. Lobov, the former Garrison commander (and soldier who was shot by Gabi) joined the Scouts prior to the attack as a way to bite back at Marley.

One concrete idea I had was her being one of the informants the Yeagerists had before their eventual takeover of the government.

In Chapter 112: Ignorance (and the end of episode 72: Children of the Forest), Floch and several soldiers storm Niccolo's restaurant to detain the Scouts. Floch confronts Hange about not negotiating with the military, mainly Pixis, as it was Eren's decision. He then predicts that the commander has to be drawing up a plan to capture Eren. 

Hange then says 'You're being delusional... or is that what your friends in the Garrison told you?"" I think it was a huge example of missed potential to not have Rico involved here. I believe she would have been a perfect turncoat for the Yeagerists, as she has close ties to Pixis and the other Garrison members in general.

Another aspect to have made the scene even better would to have Rico in the restaurant herself, bonus points if she’s the one arresting Hange. Her being re-introduced would be a powerful reveal and callback to the earlier chapters since we have one real scene of her in season 2 of the anime and she's only featured in a single panel (and moment in the anime) in the Return to Siganshina arc. Us viewers and readers haven't seen her in actual YEARS.

A second idea I had was to include her in defending Eren during Marely's surprise attack on the walls (episode 76 to 78 of the anime). The concept of her helping to defend the Attack Titan again would serve as an interesting callback to season 1 of the show.

I can really see her assisting Floch and other Yeagerists in assaulting the Cart Titan. I can see her giving Pieck a good challenge based on what we know of Rico's combat ability. I think her commenting on the different titan shifters and abilities would be interesting, given the fact she hasn't seen any of them besides Eren's.

Since she's alive at the very end of the story, she obviously would survive the encounter, maybe being injured in the chaos after the Colossal titans break down the walls. I can picture her helping Floch and the others detain the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers.

Past that, I don't see her being an active part of the story. The harbor battle goes horribly for the Yeagerists with the amount of casualties they take (maybe she'd be too injured to fight there?). And there's no chance that Rico would catch up to the main characters after the Rumbling starts. I like to think that she's just chilling on the island.

Ok, that's it. If you read through this, thank you! This was an idea I had brewing in my head for the past couple of days.

#**What about dubs?**

[Attack on Titan Season 2 English Dub will being airing on Toonami starting from April 22nd onwards.](https://www.funimation.com/simuldubs/) A [short promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZyxcdbQqvE) has been released as well. This means it will be 3 weeks behind the subbed version.

#**Why did it take so many years?** 

Two reasons: 

- Firstly, they wanted to wait for enough manga material to come out. Season 1 covered the first 33 chapters and the manga had reached Chapter 50 by the time Season 1 was finished, so they had to wait at least a year or two. However, the manga is currently on Chapter 91 as of March 2017, so there is more than enough material for Season 2 and there has been for a while. Which brings us to the second reason.  
- Secondly, once there was sufficient material, the Studio (Studio WIT) was too busy making other anime. AoT S2 was originally announced for 2016, but it is speculated that the release of Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress caused them to delay it for a year. /u/toutoune134 has made [an excellent graphic]( http://i.imgur.com/6UiIx3t.jpg) to show what Studio WIT has been up to for these last few years.

#**Will it be faithful to the source material?** 

Almost certainly. Every single scene from the trailers is a direct copy of a scene from the manga. Many interviews discuss how the anime team wishes to adapt certain scenes from the manga. It also makes no sense for them to wait this long if they were just going to create something original.

#**How long will it be?** 

It will be 12 episodes long (1 cour). This is confirmed by the number of BluRays - the entire season is supposed to be contained on 2 discs of 6 episodes each, 24 minutes per episode.

#**What will the release schedule be like?**

The episodes will come out one at a time, week by week. They will air on Tokyo MX at 10 PM Japan Time Zone. [Use this website to compare when that is with where you live.]( https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converted.html?iso=20170401T22&p1=248&p2=234&p3=179&p4=136)

#**Will it be on Netflix?**

Japanese Netflix will be getting the episodes weekly shortly after they air, but there is no news yet for American or other Netflix. Netflix didn't get Season 1 until a long time after it had aired, so don't get your hopes up.

#**I want to read the comic, where do I start?** 

Season 1 went up to Chapter 33. Start from there, or backtrack a bit and start from Chapter 30 since the final battle is very different. There are not many significant differences, other than the final battle, some filler, and some characters having different personalities (i.e. in the manga Eren is less angry and Hange is less crazy). The manga releases at a rate of one 45 page chapter per month, officially on the 8th of each month. Though sometimes the chapters leak a few days early.

#**Where will Season 2 end?**

If it's only 1 cour, then it will likely end around Chapter 50.

#**What about Season 3?**

Definitely not this year and probably not next year either. Studio Wit has another new show, The Ancient Magus' Bride, airing from October 2017 to the end of March 2018, as well as another unknown Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress project lined up for 2018. So chances are we won't get Season 3 until 2019, but this is just speculation.

#**Who is responsible for taking so long?**

We don't know, but the ultimate decisions are always made by the Production Committee. The Production Committee oversees the entire project, and consists of a number of different companies, including but not limited to Production I.G. (the studio's parent company) and Kodansha (the manga publisher).

#**Is there a summary of the plot?** 

If you want to be refreshed on Season 1 but don't want to rewatch the whole show, there are 2 recap movies that you can watch. You can find them online. If you want a summary of what's to come, you can [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/5ddxh8/manga_spoilers_i_wrote_a_summary_of_the_story/) or check out the Attack on Titan Wiki.

#**Will it be good?** 

There's no way I can give a definitive answer to this. I personally consider this arc to the best out of the whole story. Perfect mix of action, horror, revelations, twists, violence, and character development. Unfortunately, this will not answer many of the most pressing questions, as the season will be too short. But there are many vastly differing opinions on the quality. Some people think the story got better, some think it became trash. You'll have to wait and see, and decide for yourself.

#**Where should I look for official news?** 

[The official website](http://shingeki.tv/season2/) is the main source of announcements and news. Funimation, Crunchyroll, and Anime News Network are all trustworthy sources as well. News will also all be posted to /r/ShingekiNoKyojin. The Attack on Titan Wikia is very well curated and posts announcements as well, but beware spoilers and trolls seeking to spread lies. Don’t completely trust sources such as MyAnimeList.net or Wikipedia, as they can be edited by anyone, and will sometimes contain fake rumours.

I hope that helps clear up most of the big questions for tomorrow. Again, this is not meant as an April Fool's Day joke. Hope the season turns out well, and hope we all enjoy it.

So during the conversation in 139 a lot of big things are said by Eren, first the fact that he killed 80% of humanity, he says that with a straight face, the fact that he could have very well killed his friends, with a straight face. The fact that he killed his mom, he finally shows emotion for 1 panel before moving on completely, he acknowledged the fact that he's the reason Sasha and Hange died, the fact that he's about to die. Then out of nowhere he starts crying about Mikasa. The first time I saw it I just thought Eren seriously didn't care about the other things if that's what gets him crying, besides the last 3 episodes Eren's never shown any romantic interest for Mikasa. Mikasa has been said by the author to actually be like a motherly figure for Eren and I can kinda see that ( that was years ago though still tho) Hell, he didn't even show this type of reaction around Zeke when they talked about it, nor around Historia when he told her he was gonna kill everyone. This just seems like fan service tbh, the eremika ship wasn't foreshadowed well at all, again, he never showed any romantic interest before the end parts of season 4, and my problem isn't the ship, nor is it the fact that Eren is showing emotion, every time eren shows emotion it's fine a lot of people call season 1-3 Eren edgy and a crybaby but I feel like those are just parts of his character, my problem is the lackluster shoehorn of a ship. And if you seriously think it's foreshadowed well, I can't change your mind, I know someone's gonna bring up 1 specific moment of him caring a lot for Mikasa or something like chapter 50, and if you think that's proof of love then I'd like to remind you that Eren literally let himself be eaten by a titan to save Armin, is that proof of bromance? No, they're good friends being good friends doesn't equate to romance. I'm also not here just to prove my point, I'd like to talk about it with other fans of the series.

My guess is people have just forgotten a lot of details of the story as its been a long time since we got another episode. Plus, most of these issues are just due to a lack of explanation.

Let me start off by saying im quite sleepy and so some of these may already be explained, but for the most part its very clear there are some issues with the story. Regardless, ill start of by addressing each of these issues and elaborating on the problems:

**Ymir’s connection with Mikasa Ackerman**

It’s been established since about early season 3 that Ackerman’s are immune to the titan serum and the powers of the founding titan. This is even mentioned by Levi in the finale. This means that Ymir should not have been able to give Mikasa those headaches by accessing her mind. Even the idea that Mikasa gets headaches whenever Ymir accesses her mind is also not explained well at all.

Also, Eren should not have been able to erase Mikasa’s memories as she is an Ackerman. 

**Eren killing his mom**

Eren killed his mom to basically form himself to the person he is at the end. But the problem with this idea is that it ignores other plot points of the story. Eren gaslights tf outta Reiner back in Marley when asking Reiner why his mom died. At this point in the story, he already knows he did it, but just completely gaslights Reiner to the breaking point. 

**Erasing titan powers**

Does anyone actually know why this happened? In the manga, its better explained that after the centipede thing dies, titans were erased from the word. But they didn’t really explain it well in the anime at all cause im still seeing dozens of posts asking if the boy at the end will get titan powers from exploring the tree. Basically, no he won’t because centipede thing died.

**Is the story predetermined or not?**

Eren mentioned that the entire ending was already determined and that it always ended up happening no matter how hard he tried. But then Armin and Eren talk about whether they couldve done things differently. So was the ending predetermined or not? Its not clear and as you can see, a lot of the issues i have with this story is that a lot of things are just not explained at all.

**Eren doesn’t really know why did all of this**

Even with the previous point aside, Eren clearly say he doesn’t know why he did all of this. This was explained better in the anime with Eren mentioning he’s an idiot and an idiot with power. But they still don’t really explain his motivations that well. If the story is predetermined, then it makes sense why he wouldnt know. But since even that is ambiguous, we are left wondering.

**Mikasa knowing where Eren is**

I could understand if she told Levi to attack the nape so she could kill Eren, but there is just no way she could know he was in the mouth. Especially since Titans are normally in the nape. This was unexplained.

**Previous titan shifters working against Eren**

So like, how does this work? Doesn’t the founding titan have power over everyone? So it seems like Eren let them rebel against him on purpose. But honestly, even this part isn’t explained well. Alongside with Zeke flipping his stance after one convo with Armin. Oh and them randomly entering the Paths and leaving the paths. Its just all unexplained. 

**The extreme amounts of plot armor**

In the past, the crew has struggled against shifters so many times and characters like Erwin have literally died from them. Yet when they go against hundreds of titan shifters, none die? Its to the point where not only they live, their entire families also lived 😂 

Like even Falco who just got titan powers yesterday, was able to know how to change into a bird and evade hundreds of previous titans. Eren got good aim to be able to have all these titans just injure everyone and not kill them. 

**Ymir’s love for Fritz**

Lots of people are claiming its stockholm syndrome and it could be. But to give no indication to this and then in the final chapter say its cause of love and that Mikasa is actually the main character was pretty annoying to me. Just felt like lazy writing to me imo. Regardless, even if we do accept this explanation, why didn’t Ymir Fritz listen to any of the previous examples of love? Historia and Ymir (not Ymir Fritz) were in love and Ymir still left her while knowing she would be eaten. Or why didn’t Ymir Fritz take an example from how Historia rebelled against the royal family and didn’t kill Eren? There are a lot of examples she could have chosen, but why Mikasa? It all felt rushed tbh. 

**Final Thoughts**

There are just so many issues and unanswered questions to this story that I just don’t like. Don’t even get me started on Armin and the crew basically “forgiving” Eren in the end after he committed genocide.

It is very unreasonable to complain though, I read some of the reviews on IMDB and it seems like the manga was rushed as well towards the end. I guess they just made the best of whatever material they had.

I'm curious though, from the top posts in this sub I seem to generally see more praise than hate for the ending. Haven't browsed the sub too much though, gotta say that, I've been trying to avoid spoilers.

So let's see, I'm going to make a poll, solely regarding S4 E30, a random sample of users of this sub should show what the general consensus is as of now. Did you like or dislike the last episode?

If you sort through the user reviews of episode 17 right now on IMDB you'll notice that a whopping 20% of people gave the episode a 1/10 rating.  Is this because the episode is terrible? Almost certainly not. This is because of how butthurt people are about the manga's ending. Now, I have finished the manga and, while I understand some of the criticism, I really love it. But none of us have seen the ending of the anime. So stop acting like you have. And for that matter, stop 1/10 the entire anime and manga on IMDB and myanimelist. Are we really acting like just because the ending isn't everything you hoped for it devalues the other 90% of the material that you thought was amazing?

&#x200B;

It also lines up with Eren's general confusion and not understanding why nothing worked because if Ymir was altering events (Mikasa seemed to have some form of relationship with Ymir as well) and Eren states he only knew that he continued due to the result of 'Mikasa's choice'.

&#x200B;

So in my eyes either:

&#x200B;

1.) Eren could control all titans from the start but that doesn't really make any logical sense to me. 

2.) Ymir was involved in setting up some of the events to transpire (Dina killing Eren's mom, Eren not having the ability to change anything despite having the ability to change things Grisha did)

3.) It's simply a time paradox

&#x200B;

If this was a small little hint at this then that would make everything in the final episode/chapter 139 make a lot more sense since Eren was not even aware of what was truly happening. Ymir would be responsible as well and it would shed a different look on how we see Eren as in this case he would literally be a slave to someone he thought he freed.

&#x200B;

Lastly it would also make sense of why Grisha gave him the founder since we don't know why he did and he also contradicts himself when he goes to fight Eren so if Eren can give false memories to someone like he did with Mikasa then perhaps Ymir can do the same.

&#x200B;

But it did feel like it was tied together haphazardly to try and reach the conclusion isayama wanted for his story. 

It simply lacks the setup and ""polish"" to smoothly transition from a story hyperfocused on the ongoing events, characters and scenarios to drive the plot forward, to a story which zooms out and overtly tries to observe and make a statement on human nature, meaning of existence, and ends up hurting the audience who are invested in the events, characters, and scenarios till the last half hour of the final special. 

The nature of the mcguffin (space centipede) impacts the entire narrative of attack of titan more than the themes of human nature and meaning of existence, Of course they are important, but not as important as thr mcguffin, which is completely abandoned, there has been little to no efforts made to connect it thematically, explain it, or make it matter to the conclusion of the story.

I think this is it, I liked the ending, but it was more due to the fact that I like attack on titan, and less about it being good. It does not ruin attack on titan for me. Wit Seasons are one of the GOATs in all media, Mappa gave their best efforts to carry their legacy, infact the two episodes before rumbling starts are the top two episodes in the series, the third being ""Perfect Game"" from season 3.

Truly monumental piece of media which is now bigger than any of its participants yet wouldnt be anything without them. Attack on Titan will be remembered for the tsunamis it created with its impact and defined its industry and medium. Attack on Titan will continue to be relevant for the medium itself and for us as humans for atleast our lifetimes.

After ending of season 4 part 2 I coulddnt wait any longer and so finished the Manga. So by the time I finished the Manga the extra pages were already out. Before the last few chapters AOT was easily my favorite show ever(movies, series, Manga, cartoon). 

Going in to the finale fully understood alliance's motivation and the eren/jaegerist motivation. If I was from Paradis I would be a jaegerist but as the reader I understand that if the jaegerist succeeded nothing would actually in terms of the cycle of war. The world would just be smaller. Everyone can agree that while the alliance had well-meaning motivations they have any sort counter argument to the jaegerists, beside genocide bad. 

Also going into the finale a big plot point was who has the strongest resolve will win. Eren's resolve to keep moving forward or the alliance's weaker resolve becuase they care about eren. Then there's also the cylve of war/revenge theme where some one will always rise up to revenge/there will always be blowback. Fate/predeterminism is also a huge theme with the paths, attack titan and zeke. 

So when I read the final chapters I was immeasurably disappointed that the plot changed into eren doing mass genocide to show ymir that it's okay to disobey someone you love for the greater good. Mikasa killing eren equating to ymir stop following fritz's orders to make titans. Also between eren killing his own mother and Paradis being destroyed at most 100 years after the ending showing that there is nothing you can do about the cycle of hatred and fate does exist. 

Then was the logical plot holes of the alliance members being able to go back to Paradis and not be imprisoned or killed for betraying the jaegerists and safety of Paradis as a whole. 

I'd give the Manga ending a 2/10. Now moving onto the anoe ending there are somethings that have to be kept in mind. In Manga, you can't control the pace at which the reader takes in thbe story and certain plot points. A reader can dissect 1 page as long he wants to before going onto the next page. In anime it could juts be 3 second dialogue or just picture that flashes on screen briefly. The fact the episode was an 1hr30 with most of the glaring issues being in the last 20min,meamt just wanted to get to the end and couldn't fully absorb all he plot and revelation happening. I see a lot of anime onlys saying they enjoyed it, but will have to watch it again to actually take in everything that happened. 

Also the Manga ending came out during the peak of AOT popularity and investment. A lot of sentiment online for anime ending is ""I'm just happy I got to see the end. "" AOT isn't as popular now as it was 2-3 years ago. It goes without saying that the anime ending had unbelievable prodiction and voice acting which can distract from the writing flaws. 

A lot of Manga readers were hoping that more context around the ending would fix it but for the most part they actually took out and changed the worst parts. The ""Thank you for becoming a mass murderer"" line changed to ""You're and idiot who couldn't control the power and we're probably both going to hell"". Jean not being showed to be cucked by dead eren forever. Paradis being showed to be destroyed in a much more futuristic setting Han the Manga. In the manga it was 100 years after the ending max. In the anime it looks like 500+ years minimum.

So, after we got about halfway through part 2 of season 4, I realized there was no way we would be finishing the story by the end of these 12 episodes. At that point, after waiting a year to get what I thought was going to be the conclusion to the story, I said fuck it and decided to read the manga from the beginning, which I finished a couple months ago. After spending a long time thinking about it, putting it together, and having a long conversation with a friend of mine who was actually the one that introduced me to Attack on Titan a few years ago while we were still in college, who was a longtime reader of the manga, and who also warned me not to read the manga since he found the ending so disappointing, I felt confident enough to go ahead and go through with this. He agreed that this version was a lot better than what we got and remedied the major issues we had with the ending of the story, and he was the one who advised me to post this here and see if there are any talented artists that are big fans of the series but also felt pretty underwhelmed by the conclusion to the story that might be interested in making this thing real. 

Now getting into reflections on the last two volumes. First of all, volume 33 was fucking awesome. 131 and 134 specifically are two of the best chapters in the entire series. 132 is also really good and 133 is very solid. I was so, so hyped going into the final battle between the crew and Eren going into the final volume at the end of 134. Everything had been set up so well for our final conflict, and then all that potential was just...squandered. Which leads me into my major criticisms of the final volume of the series.

1.	There was almost no cost to our crew stopping the rumbling. Yes, Magath and Hange die on the way there, but literally zero members of the crew die during the final battle of the entire series. That lack of cost made it feel really unearned for us when Eren is ultimately killed and the rumbling stopped.

2.	Eren's plan makes absolutely no sense. Leaving behind 20% of the world's population, probably about 200 million people compared to the 1 million on the island, is just asking for Paradis to be annihilated in five or ten years. It's just way too many people. How could the world not see his friends as heroes? Because they're Eldians! Ya know, like the thing that has been the issue the whole time? That the world hates your people, Eren? Not to mention that Historia is the queen, which means her fate is directly tied to the island's. It just makes no sense.

3.	The way the titans end also makes absolutely no sense. If it was just up to Ymir the whole time then she should have done after she rejected Zeke and his royal blood and chose for herself. Why bother with the rumbling if she could just end her own suffering right then and there?

4.	The idea that Mikasa giving up her love for Eren convinced Ymir to give up her love for the first King Fritz, who sacked her village, cut out her tongue, enslaved her, hunted her, and raped her, to end the power of the titans, felt...gross, and also incredibly unfair to Eren. Eren may be a genocidal maniac, and Mikasa’s love for Eren may not be the healthiest given how dependent she was on him, but he actually loved Mikasa. Their relationship was nothing like the relationship between Ymir and King Fritz. One was abuse, while the other was love. Imperfect, but still true, honest love. So I really, really hated that, clearly.

5.	Finally, it absolutely destroyed Eren's character and turned him into a convoluted mess. He literally gives his explicit motivations in chapter 131, and then in 139 he suddenly doesn't know why he did it? Like, dude you said in 131 that you were doing it for the island, but also because when you finally went to the outside world you dreamed about since you were a child, everywhere you looked, you saw the walls. You wanted to tear down the walls, and then suddenly, you don't? The Eren we know never would have taken the risk of turning his friends into heroes and leaving up the walls when just fucking killing everyone else and tearing down the walls is the much safer option. Eren would not have wanted to be stopped. He would keep moving forward.

Before we get into the re-write that I believe addresses all of these issues, a quick forewarning. Obviously, if you liked the original version, you probably won't like this one. If you wanted complete and total victory for Eren, then you probably won't like this version, because we will not get that. If you don't like the final pages, then you probably won't like this. In fact, in this version the final pages stay exactly the same. Lastly, if you were hoping for a happy ending, then you haven't been paying attention. This is the George R.R. Martin school of storytelling. My goal is not to make you feel as happy as possible by the end of the story. My goal is to deliver a story that is narratively compelling and an ultimately satisfying conclusion to this epic tale that we, frankly, did not get in the original version.

Also, I know I said this was a volume 34 re-write, but I did make one small change to chapter 133. There also ended up being enough material in this re-write to add another chapter, and so we end with chapter 140 instead of chapter 139.

I don't wanna post the whole summary re-write here since it's 4000 words, but if you generally had those same criticisms and you're curious, go ahead and dm me and I'll send you the summary re-write. I even have storyboard rough-drafts done for all of the chapters with descriptions and dialogue in them. The problem is that I can't draw, I don't know anyone who can draw that well, and if it's not going to look good, then there's not much point in making it. I wouldn't be able to pay anyone, and it wouldn't be for profit obviously. But I and my friend honestly think this is the much better ending, and we'd both love to make it real, so if you're an artist who's curious about what this re-write looks like, go ahead and dm me and I'll send you the summary.

I haven't read the manga ending or know it. I'm just waiting for part 4 to come out. I just got to thinking and wanted to share something about the series I love so much being a writer myself. Now when this show came I was a part of that early hype train. It was cool. I watched the first season and liked it a bunch. I gave it an 8 if I recall. 

Then we had that wait and I kind of fell out of AOT despite reading some of the manga. I was bored. It didn't help that when season 2 came out. I already knew what was going to happen. I didn't hate the show mind you. I was just sick of waiting. Looking back on season 2, I realize just how damn good some of these scenes were. 

I stopped watching AOT as I got busy with life, school, work, and other shows. I didn't hear any of the season 3 buzz at all until like maybe part 2 of season 3 came out. I still didn't watch it. Though, once I heard the final season was becoming a thing and the manga was ending. I went on an epic binge-watch. This binge would make Netflix watchers jealous. I watched the start of season 3 and all of the episodes of the final season that were available within five days. I became a fan again and AOT in this season went from human kids I like fighting these creepy monsters to this very in-depth character-driven drama with lots of lore and history to go with it. The character writing and development really sold me this latter part of AOT. On top of that, the show became the master of the calm before the storm. You know what is happening but the writing is done in a way that builds this tension that will just punch you in the gut no matter if you are ready for it or not. This wasn't just a Shonen anymore but characters trying to survive a fucked up world where they are seen as devils by the outside world.

Lastly, I think the way it went about answering the questions we had really showed that the Titans weren't just man-made but this kind of weird cult shit where you are blessed with great power but the drawback is that you are now on borrowed time. That shit really took me for a loop. Now we draw closer as the winter season is near and we are going to be taken for one more emotional rollercoaster.

From s1 to s4pt1, I have not disagreed with a single creative decision made by Isayama to forward the plot so far, but things are different all of a sudden. I know I am not alone in feeling slightly disappointed by this season, but unlike other people, I am not talking about the pace or animation, since these are by the studio and are being forced upon them. I am talking about actual plot decisions made by isayama.

1) It all began with how he decided to release Annie… Ever since the attack on marley, we were led to believe that the sole purpose of the jaw titan was to be a tool to free annie from the crystal (yk, since porco had 0 character development). All that anticipation, just for eren to simply uses the founding power and inadvertently free her. To me, that is a flaw in his storytelling and a waste of a great Chekhov’s gun.

 2) Second thing that really bugs me, is that in this final stretch of episodes(essentially the entire season so far, he has managed to completely sideline Eren, zeke, levi, and historia(and baby). Some would say they were the main characters of the show at one point. Now, I understand they need to show this new alliance form and perhaps the pace is making it seem worse than it actually is, but to me it’s just a poor creative decision to keep all them locked away as it really knocks down the audience’s engagement. When writing plot, you need to constantly leave a trail of breadcrumbs for the audience to stay engaged and follow the plot. If you simply bottle everything interesting for 8 chapters in a row, you start to lose interest. Now perhaps this works better in the manga since 8 chapters is a mere evening’s read, but in this format, its pissing me off. 

3) Other random things that pissed me off, lack of anything from pieck, mikasas sudden bloodthirst and her regression/backwards developent (reminding me of jamie lannister rn), use of forgotten characters at the docks that failed to invoke any emotion when Connie shot them, and even the whole Connie-falco excursion to ragako which felt like such an unnecessary side story amidst chaos, easily could’ve been written better to service the plot more. 

4) Lastly, the direction he has taken with this plot has me concerned for the ending. This kind of danger always occurs when you make 1 character so OP and hard to beat, that the author backs himself into a corner and is forced to write some soft nonsense to bring the character down since they are untouchable physically. If I am being shallow minded or if I’m genuinely missing something please kindly let me know instead of sending me death threats thanks. I really hope I just missed stuff/didn’t read between the lines because I really want this show to end at the top of my list.",False,False,attackontitan,Creative disagreements w/ plot…,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/attackontitan/comments/tlzg2n/creative_disagreements_w_plot/

I think that rather than sticking to the general 1 chapter per episode method that s4 p2 followed, I think s4 p3 should spread out a bit and take some time to develop the ending a bit more. I think part 3 should be around 12 episodes and could easily reach that mark if it spent time developing things like Ymir’s Stockholm syndrome, which is something that I feel didn’t get good developed in the manga and should’ve taken more time. I also think that Eren and Armin’s conversation should be a whole episode that really takes it’s time and is a bit more thorough than the manga. Lastly, I think the last episode should be the last 16 pages of the final chapter and that the pages about Mikasa’s future, and Paradis’s long term future should be expanded upon a bit more.

- ""Then why is season 4 literally titled The Final Season?"" well they greenlit it before the manga finished so that's one possible explanation. The other might be based on technicality: it is the final season, after which we get a movie -- no further seasons. Shitty move but oh well.

- Leakers with a reliable history have confirmed that the movie exists and already has a name. Not putting that here.

- You may have heard of Isayama apologizing to the animators for the hell that they'll have to go through to bring to life the last couple of chapters. The movie is one way to give MAPPA some additional time to animate the complexity. This also helps with the production of S4P2 since it focuses on lesser material. 

- The final episode of S4P2 was slated to air on 28th March. This has now been pushed to 4th April as there is some sort of an AoT stage in Japan on 28th March. We can expect the movie to be announced here.

# Attack Titan Future Vision Hack

We know all titans can see the memories of their ancestors occasionally through different triggers. Eren sees Grisha's memories all the time throughout the series. We also know that the attack titan can see the future memories of all its successors. What happens when you combine the two? Grisha ends up seeing Eren's future, and then when Eren sees Grisha's memories, Eren end up seeing his own future. Very importantly: **This hack requires you have an ""ancestor"" whose memories you can inherit.** This will become relevant later. Also relevant: **The host of the attack titan can choose which memories to show his ancestors and which to hide and when.** You can see this when Grisha asks Eren ""What happens to Carla? Is she ok?"" when he was with the royal family. You also notice that he has a few panels of staring in disbelief, as Eren shows him the future that results form him killing the royal family, including the rumbling. Eren chose not to show his father, that in this future, his wife will die. And he only showed him what will happen after he'd already killed the royal family. **That's why Grisha asks Zeke to stop Eren, because the rumbling, and the end of the world, isn't what he wants.**

Now, this might get a bit philosophical, but imagine we have a machine that sees the future and shows you the predictions. If I see that I'm going to trip and break my arm 3 hours from now, *that knowledge will change the future* correct? Since I will make sure to avoid the place I trip in, or otherwise I will act differently. But then, that means the machine now has to *recalculate the future* since I just changed it simply by knowing what's about to happen. What happens now? Does the machine just end up recalculating forever? Well, no, *it will stop recalculating when I see a future that doesn't change with the knowledge I have of it.* **In other words, if I'm satisfied with the future I see, and won't change it in any way, then the future predicting machine is correct and doesn't have to recalculate.** Note, in this thought experiment, **the time predicting machine will finally be accurate, when it shows you the future you wouldn't change anything about.**

We know from the manga that Eren saw his future (using the above exploit) when he touched historia's hand. What happens when Eren sees his future? Well that future changes if he doesn't like it correct? Cuz if he doesn't like what he sees, he'll just do something else with better consequences. *So in this case, Grisha is acting like the time predicting machine, and Eren touching historia's hand is him looking at the machine's calculations.* So this means, that whatever future Eren ends up with, **It's the future that he chose. It's the future that he wouldn't change anything about.**

# Time Loop Fuckery

So already we can see that Eren had complete choice here. If he saw a future he didn't like when touching historia's hand, he would simply not follow that path. Meaning that the future he sees, and the path he walks, is EXACTLY the one he wanted to walk. This gets philosophical. **The path Eren sees IS the one he will walk. He has no alternative. However, it is also exactly the path we WANTS to walk.** So does he have free will? I'm inclined to say yes.

We also know what this path leads to. It lead to Eren getting the founder's power, and using it to (among other things) rescue Berthold in the past. Eren talks about how he caused the Titan that was about to eat Berthold to ignore him because ""It would be too early for him to die"". **What would have happened if Berthold died?** **Armin would be dead.** Eren won't have that. Also, we know that the Founding Titan can cause tiny influences in different time periods now (such as distracting a titan away).

So let's think about a timeline where Berthold died and Armin didn't get the colossal titan. Even in this timeline, Eren would eventually trigger Grisha's memories and see his future using the exploit. Now what? Well, he would see a future, let's call it future A. He doesn't like this future so he will not bring it about. Now the timeline has to recalculate. He sees future B. And so on. Until future Y. In future Y, Eren acquires the successor's powers, and learns they can change the timeline. This opens up a whole new dimension. Eren sees a future where he can change the timeline, however, we know that the final future Eren sees, will be the one he goes through, because it's the one he wouldn't change. Which is that future? **The future where Armin lives because Eren saves Berthold using the founder's powers.** He sacrificed his mom, for his friend. That's why Eren saves Berthold. From the moment he touched Historia's hand, not only the future but the past was already decided. **Eren decided the entire timeline. He is the mastermind.**

But there is one bit of time loop fuckery that remains unexplained. **What was the dream in episode 1 all about?** Eren supposedly saw his entire future in that dream. In the Anime he sees flashbacks of different parts of the story in his own perspective, but in the manga he only sees mikasa telling him goodbye. Mikasa telling him goodbye is the last thing Eren sees before he dies, so we can presume he saw his entire future in that ""very long dream"" in episode 1. Was it just foreshadowing? Well, yes. But it was also:

# Ymir

I see a lot of people convinced that Ymir was the mastermind orchestrating everything from the start. I don't think so. I think her significance is very different. First off, we must remember something: **Only two people in history possessed both the Founding Titan and the Attack Titan's powers at the same time.** Ymir. And Eren. What does this mean?

Well we already know that the Attack Titan has access to his successors' memories (and ancestors' but that's not attack titan specific). And we learn during the last couple of chapters that the Founding Titan can change things in different time periods.

**What would you need to send Eren his entire future in a dream like in episode 1?** You need to:

1. Know Eren's future.
2. Be able to modify things in different times.

Who knows Eren's future? The attack titans. Who knows Eren's future AND is able to modify things at different times? Eren, and Ymir. That's it.

# The dream, an SOS

Ymir and Eren are very different in one crucial aspect though, **Ymir has no ancestors, so she can't do the Attack Titan future vision hack. Ymir cannot see her own future.** Even Eren doesn't know Ymir's past (at least, he doesn't show he does at all), so Ymir couldn't have seen her future through Eren's memories using the Attack Titan power either. She doesn't know that she will die to a spear and be enslaved by the royal family for 2000 years. And when it happens?

**She sends Eren his future in a dream as an SOS.** Let me explain. Eren knows his own future through Grisha. So he knows he didn't send himself that dream in episode 1 using the founding's powers (why would he). Who else could have sent it? Ymir.

THAT'S what Eren means when he says ""You've been guiding me this whole time"" in the manga. He figures out, it was Ymir who sent him his future in a dream. Ymir is not a mastermind. She only sent that dream so that Eren would know who it came from, and know that she is seeking his help to break free form the curse. **She could have only hoped her savior would be Eren, as he was the** **only other person to possess the founding and attack titans at the same time**.

You can see on the page that Ymir is dying, there is a certain flower, in the middle of the panels where she's losing consciousness. **The same flower Eren wakes up seeing.** This was the moment Ymir sent Eren the dream, so that she knows when her savior arrives. This is why the first episode is titled ""To you, 2000 years from now"". **What is the first panel we see Eren in the manga? It's when Mikasa is telling him goodbye. Which is the last thing Eren sees before he dies.** My theory is: Eren lived with Mikasa for 4 years in the ""coordinate"" the same way he talked to Armin. We know time passes incredibly slowly there. And he did that, right before she killed him. So it was the last thing he saw.

# The Conclusion

Eren pulled a lelouch in the ending. ""When the whole world hates me and you kill me, everyone will love each other!"" He picked the ending that would lead to the end of the Titan Curse. After Ymir sees Mikasa get over her obsessive love with Eren and kill him because it's necessary, she learns to get over her love of King Fritz (stockholm syndrome more like) and move on, ending the curse of the Titans. The one that liberated Ymir was technically Mikasa, but Eren knew this is the outcome that would happen. He ultimately decided what everyone will do. He was the mastermind (he didn't know what happens after he dies though)

**The only one that was truly free the whole time, was really, Eren.** He did what he said he will do in episode 1. He got power. And he killed them all. At least he tried, and it almost worked.

But what was it all for? In the last couple of slides we see Paradis Island getting bombed to hell anyways (though I think this was more a WW3 type of situation and EVERYONE is nuked, not just Paradis, though I have no proof). And in the last page we see a tree similar to where worm-kun came from. This suggests the boy at the end will be the new Ymir. The cycle will start over again. It was completely pointless.

It goes back to what Erwin was saying.

""Everyone will die someday. Does this mean life is meaningless? Was there even any meaning in us being born into this world? Would we say that of our fallen comrades? Their lives...were they meaningless? NO, THEY WEREN’T! It’s us who gives meaning to our comrades lives! The brave fallen! The anguished fallen! The ones who will remember them...are us, the living! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world!""

Even when all these characters are dead, we can hope someone will remember them and transmit their lessons to the next generation. If not, at least we'll remember them. And here's to hoping someone breaks the cycle. No matter how hopeless it may seem.",True,False,attackontitan,"My AOT theory. Major spoilers, goes all the way to the last chapter and extra pages.

The video is about the way Attack on Titans lends itself to be interpreted and the media literacy that goes into how people interpret the work and why it is so divisive among people in the message that the story gives out. It's another topic altogether but the point is that the comment section of this video was filled with how people had interpreted the message of Attack on Titan and their justifications.  Because of this, I gave my own interpretation and since I believe what I commented on there was something of substance, I figured I put down here what I said. (Spoilers, it will deal with the manga's ending so be warned if you haven't read it).

 To me the story is about the real cost of freedom. From the first episodes, the audience was shown the reality of the scout regiment condition. Eren was beaming with awe at those who were supposed to be the symbol of freedom and were seeking freedom from the walls and the titans only to be met with the harrowing sight of the defeated scouts. Regardless, Erenstilll had the desire to join the scouts and seek freedom regardless of the depressing sights of the scouts who were, at that scene, supposed to display the cost of seeking freedom. Reason would dictate one to live comfortably within the walls rather than going outside the walls to discover the rest of the world however Eren's nature was that he wanted desperately to seek freedom so much so that he willing to risk his life for it.  That was all from the first episode. 

Later on, the plot reveals the reality of what the king did to the people of paradis in removing their memories and making them live in blissful ignorance within the walls. The king represented security and comfort which is a natural desire within all humans. Eren as a character is meant to clash with this notion but the story never goes to romanticize freedom over security but instead show the ugly nature of the cost of freedom. When you reflect back on the plot, the greatest peace the world experience in the setting of AOT is when the elites of Paradis did everything they can to remove any risk of the population uncovering the truth of the world. This was seen in the ackermans persecution, the stunting of technological advancements, etc. The setting of paradis, artificially constructed by king Fritz, was meant to represent an idyllic peace. A ""paradise"" as where the lands name came from. Sure people died from the titans from time to time but there would be no active conflicts between the Eldians and the rest of the world which would've cost much more lives.  Because of the inextinguishable hatred the world has for the Eldians, this was the best option for peace. It was only when Eren and the Scouts continued to search for the truth that the world was put in great danger which inevitably concluded in Eren wiping out most of the world. Because of the hatred from the outside world, the tyrannical 'peace' maintained by the elites was the best option to maintaining security in the world.  In a sense, the scouts uncovering the truth was a disaster in terms of the future affairs of the world since they would have to deal with the inevitable conflict from facing the rest of the world.   In other words, if Eren and the scouts desire to seek freedom had failed before they uncovered the false world created by the royal family, the world would be at peace and the genocide that Eren committed would never had occured  Eren's decision displayed in the plot showcases his continuous decision to pursue freedom and the disasterous consequences it brings. 

Think about it, can it really be said that all the deaths sacrificed to uncover the truth of the world was worth it when the answer is not that there exist out there, large uncharted lands to be discovered but that the outside world is populated by people who wants your race exterminated?   Eren's desire to see the world that was depicted in armin's book was crush when he saw the reality of the world and yet he still pursued to fulfill the consequence of what his search for freedom had led to. He couldn't tolerate sacrificing Historia and her descendants as well as transferring the titan powers and its curse to his friends because it infringe on his desire of destroying the metaphysical ""walls"" which, in his words when rejecting Zeke stated plan of sacrificing Historia to the council, would have him and his people ""continuing to live like caged animals""  He desperately wanted to be free from that sensation of being caged by the oppressive reality of the world. Whether it was the walls of shiganshina that prevented him from seeing the outside world or the plan to sacrifice his friend's welfare to achieve temporary peace, he wouldnt tolerate having his freedom limited. Which at the end, led to his decision to wipe out most of the world in order to create a free world for his love ones.   His desire to not live in a world that ""cages him and his people like animals"" led him to justify destroying the world and its foundations. He almost literally create a blank slate for the world where the titan powers, the outer nations with their systematic oppressions of the eldians, and all the world history was wiped away in place of a new world with a new setting. Since, the other plans result in his friends continuing to live in the world at the mercy of those who want them dead, a world that will forever deny his friends their freedom to live as they please, he would instead choose the plan that would cement his friends to live free from all the negative circumstances of the previous world.  

Ultimately, you're not supposed to romanticize freedom in this story as Eren's genocide is meant to be a selfish decision from him that was taken without any consideration of his friends wishes; a decision he still pursued even when Sasha died during the machinations of his grand plan. Freedom is seen through Eren as a selfish desire that can hold dangerous consequences and yet it is an inescapable emotion that one cannot pry themselves away from. Eren even shows that he recognizes the gravity of his actions and exhibits guilt and self loathing in the final chapter. He even said to armin in the path that he doesn't deserve to find a way to live after committing his plans as he hates himself for being the monster he is. He doesn't justify his actions or romanticize it. He was simply possessed by his desire for freedom and lived his life following the consequences of his desire. Eren simply cannot be any other person than the type of person he is. The circumstances of the world followed by his inherent nature lead to the inevitable consequence of his actions.   In a story like AOT where there is no good or bad, the ending can be nothing other than the consequences of the characters actions as they live as themselves in a cruel world.  Even Armin, while disgusted by Eren's actions, still shows sympathy for his friend in the final chapter as he understood where his friend is coming from all the while not condoning what he did. That's why distinctions of good and bad actions dont work in this story as it is not a story that gives a moral parable like for example freedom = good, safety in ignorance = bad, as arguments can be made for both and if anything, the story works to endorse forgoing freedom for safety.    I guess the story ultimately works to showcase the tragic conditions of human desire for freedom in a world that doesn't reciprocate said desires. You can choose to live in ignorance in a false paradise like what king fritz or destroy the world that attempts to take your freedom like what Eren did. You're free to do as you please and no one is right or wrong in their decision. One being a slave to their desires is not a bad or good thing but an inevitable thing for one to become in order to continue living in this world. 

\*This is another point I'm adding beyond what I wrote in the comments in order to address those who dislike the ending because of their reasoning that Eren was left with no choice but to wipe out the world due to the world coalition desire to wipe out Paradis and that he should've wiped out all instead of 80%. I mentioned it in the comments I copy and pasted of the other plans that Paradis was faced with. The Zeke plan of euthanizing the Eldians would've removed the need to wipe out the world as well as securing the safety of the present Eldians. His people would've be free to live their lives without facing any danger from the outside world with the cost of their fertility. In a utilitarian sense, this would create peace between the world and the Eldians that would remove any need of war. Yeah it's fucked up but it ensures ultimate peace that would remove the need of a genocide. The other plan was to sacrifice Historia as well as continuing the cycle of passing on the Titan powers with the minimal use of the rumbling being a deterrent to any outside invasion while Paradis buys itself time to modernize it's military. Again in a utilitarian sense, this would create ultimate peace which would offset the need of committing a worldwide genocide. Eren couldn't accept either of these plans as it would substitute freedom for safety which goes against his nature of always seeking freedom. The rumbling was ultimately a selfish plan from Eren who wanted to create a world that is free from the reality of the Titan powers and a world where his friends would live in complete freedom regardless of their wishes. He mentioned in chapter 131 that he \***chose**\* to do this when speaking to Ramzi instead of being forced to. He was out of time to find a different solution due to his reduced lifespan and wanted to ensure that his friends lived in a free world. Again to reiterate, Eren's actions represent the true cost of seeking freedom, one that is not romanticize and in its quintessential essence, comes from pure selfishness. It doesn't praise or condemn freedom and represents it as a transient yet unconditional entity. You could see this sort of the selfish desire of seeking freedom from the oppressive structures of the world through many revolutions like the Bolshevik revolution, who in their pursuit of creating a society free from the oppression of the class structure, will justify committing mass atrocities in order to manifest that selfish desire. The desire of freedom ultimately is not good or bad but just that it is. This goes back to what Eren said to Falco about the nature of war and conflict, and how some would willingly put themselves through that hell to seek what they desire.",True,False,attackontitan,my thoughts on how AOT is supposed to be seen and interpreted,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/attackontitan/comments/xckxpo/my_thoughts_on_how_aot_is_supposed_to_be_seen_and/

I started the show not even a month ago and finished in two days and after watching some videos waiting for the two episode release, I read a mention of Eren kissing Historia's hand and that it wasn't just Eren getting disturbed by Grisha murdering the royal family for the founding titan, so when do you guys think this chapter 121 be introduced to the show so I can finally understand what Eren saw?

There's a few questions, but please go into good, non-spoiling detail so that I can understand what has happened because going through the show so fast leaves a lot for the brain to try and comprehend, and with this confusing of a show, I missed a lot of stuff.

I get Eren is in prison for disobedience but when and why did he leave Paradis?

Could someone explain the episodes where Eren is on trial and what significantly happened during them? (not the first trial but with Historia and after that)

A little insight into the kid Ymir ate and why Reiner wasn't supposed to be selected?

The whole Tybur family is confusing so an explanation on them would be awesome

Why did Eren lose control in Trost when that never happens again?

Does Reiner actually miss Paradis or is he iffy on it?

Why does Eren say he and Reiner are the same?

I see a lot of people saying Eren got Historia pregnant, is that true or just speculation?

How was the Reiss king able to take away memories? (or is that a spoiler to answer?)

Why can't Eren take compliments on his hair? (I am currently rocking the same bun he is so I took his lack of pride immensely)

The whole Ymir lying thing and wanting to be honest was really weird so was it really insightful or just how I see it as lame?

Has there been any information on what MAPPA will do because the show is ending before the manga?

Why does the military want Eren's founding titan?

Why was Erwin locked up in a room during season 3?

When were the Jaegerists formed? Also when did Eren talk to Zeke to plan what's going on? (or are they more spoil to answer questions?)

Lastly, when will the S3E12 nightmares end? That caught me too off guard :/",False,False,attackontitan,I could really use some answers! (no spoilers please),0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/attackontitan/comments/m8trv9/i_could_really_use_some_answers_no_spoilers_please/

Caution : I never really wrote shit like this so it might be somewhat all over the place and maybe incoherent at parts. I apologise but I hope my feelings about the final chapter will get through to you, should you decide to read this long af rant.

Eren’s main goal was to actually rid the curse of titans.

He could have done it by euthanising eldia as zeke suggested but he didn’t like it. Because yearned for freedom. He didn’t want the eldians to simply die of old age knowing their entire race is going to be wiped out because they can’t reproduce. He wanted the eldians to have the freedom, that he couldn’t achieve.

He wanted to be free but he couldn’t and was a slave to his destiny and ended up doing all the horrible things and killing himself, for the sake of reaching this ending. 

Let’s be real here as long as people who can turn into titans exist, there will ALWAYS be racism and fear. The only way the world could get a shot at peace is by eradicating Titans (which eren swore to do by like chapter 1).

By killing 80% of the population, he also levelled the playing field for eldians (who would lose the power of titans) so they wouldn’t simply be killed off by the rest of the world. Whether this was intended by eren, we don’t know.

But fact is,

•	⁠all countries are NOW somewhat equal in military strength.

•	⁠titans are exterminated. Eldians have a shot at eventually redeeming their reputation as time passes

•	⁠there is now a link between paradis and the rest of the world in the form of armin and gang. They were from eldia BUT helped the world by killing the villain called eren Jaegar. 

They can be a mediator between paradis and the other countries in hopes of maybe achieving world piece.

Keep in mind even our own world was plagued with war and discrimination a while ago. But we now have atleast some semblance of peace. Our current world could be one possible future to the world of AOT. But you should understand that EVEN this is literally not possible as long as people who can turn into titans exist. They will always be viewed with fear and hatred. Thus titans had to be exterminated. 

Now eldia has a fighting chance at redeeming itself. Albeit a small one. 

As you can see wars will continue to take place. Deaths will continue to happen. The world of AOT will continue to move forward even after the end of the Manga. 

The ending is not as simple as “haha budget lelouch ending”. There are some layers to it if you think about it. And I feel the ending is somewhat different from code geass too.

Making armin and gang the “heroes” is just a side thing. It is NOT EREN’S MAIN GOAL from what I can see.

Now the REAL ISSUE with the last chapter is the terrible pacing. That’s literally it. I’m sure if the anime splits the final chapter into 2 episodes and goes into a bit more depth, I’m certain the ending would be WAAYY more impactful and epic.

As you see, although I do like the ending, I did not feel this way as I was reading the chapter. I only started to like the ending after I thought about it for quite some time.

I really do think this was a fitting ending for AOT. 

The curse of titans is broken. 

Ymir let go of her love for the king after seeing mikasa kill the one she loved. Ymir would no longer stay for an eternity in the path where she has to listen to the person who has the founder powers. She is free. 

The world is free. The people are free. The Titan powers are no more and thus they can’t influence the world. The world no Longer has a “fixed” destiny. 

Anything can happen now. The people in the world of AOT can truly sculpt the ending however they wish it to be. They are free. 

Maybe they would kill each other by war and nukes. 

Maybe they might achieve peace.

But fact is, they are no longer shackled to some singular destiny due to the disappearance of the founder Titan powers. 

The only person who couldn’t be free and followed his destiny to the end was Eren Jaegar. The one who yearned for freedom more than anything. His story is fucking tragic alright. He had to suck up his emotions and had to act cold towards his friends so that mikasa would make the final decision to kill him. He had to fucking destroy 80% of the world. But in reality he was still our whiny shounen mc in heart. He just restrained himself and became emotionless eren for a while. This is why we also so him reveal his true emotions to armin in the final chapter. Him crying about mikasa does not make him “suck”. It just makes him even more tragic. He was still the eren we knew at heart.

Oh and we also see one ending where mikasa confesses his love to him and he decides “fuck whatever happens to the world. I’m gonna live out my  remaining 5 years of life with mikasa freely”.

Especially because I've heard of a theory that, in the AoT world, exists 3 different timeline: the one in wich Mikasa and Eren live tighter for 4 years (escaping from the war); the one we know where Eren kills the 80 percent of the world population and then is killed by Mikasa; and then the anime one...Honestly, I wouldn't be surprise, I mean Isayama has more time amazed us with the plot of AoT. And here comes the second trailer of the final season. There are two details in particulars that I want to consider: first of all, the image of young Mikasa (I immagine seen by Eren perspective). The details that is intriguing is her scarf: not the usual red but black or blue st least. It can't be an error, because in animation, and in a trailer like this, everything is intentional: so there are two possibilities. First one: just a symbolism, maybe of death; second one: this is just a Mikasa from another timelines with a different scarf (and this is kind of proved by the fact that, some frames later, older Mikasa has her scarf, but now red, the usual red, and not black). Then, there is the second detail: at the end, Eren says that he will keep moving forward ""even if I die. Even AFTER I DIE"". I mean, I know he says a similar phrase, in the manga, to Grisha, but he don't says that in first person (he says ""Even if YOU die. Even after YOU die""). This (in my personal opinion) can be an int that there are more possible timeliness, because even after he dies he will just keep moving forward, every time from the beginning of the story (and also someone think that this ""beginning"" of every timeline is just him waking up from that tree seing the young Mikasa of this trailer, or in general the young Mikasa when he woke up in the first chapter of the manga of the first episode of the anime). So, for these reasons I think that the anime may have an original ending (and if it does, Isayama is more of a genius that I've already thought!).

#**What about English dubs?**

[Funimation](http://comicbook.com/2018/07/08/attack-on-titan-season-3-english-dub-premiere-date-announced-simuldub/) will be posting English Dubbed versions starting in August, a few weeks after the original broadcasts. [Toonami](https://twitter.com/ToonamiNews/status/1018952750623789056?s=19) will begin broadcasting the dubbed episodes on TV starting August 18th.

#**I heard the first episode was already available? How?**

The first episode was shown to a small audience at Anime Expo on July 8th. It was also shown in select theatres in the US and Canada on July 10th (subbed version) and July 11th (dubbed version). There are currently a few camera recordings of the episode available on the internet. The episode will not be broadcast to everyone until the formal premiere.

#**How long will it be?** 

While no official information has been released, credible sources imply that Season 3 will be 24 episodes long (2 cours). Official manga advertising from Kodansha USA indicates that it will cover 10 volumes of the manga, which would require 2 cours to fit. [YonkouProductions](https://twitter.com/yonkouprod/status/989799119047700480), a very reliable leaker, also confirms.

#**Will it be faithful to the source material?** 

The author of the manga, Isayama Hajime, [revealed in an interview included in the Season 2 Blu-ray boxset](http://comicbook.com/anime/2018/03/22/attack-on-titan-season-3-hype-hajime-isayama-uprising/) that he was “disappointed” with his work on Volumes 13-16 (which will be covered in Season 3). He says: *“Hopefully, now that Season 3 is being made, I’ll have the chance to wipe away that regret and replace it with something I’m proud of.”* This indicates that there will be some differences between the manga version and the animated version, but we don’t know yet exactly what those changes will be like.

Based on the Season 3 premiere event, it is evident that the pacing and order of certain scenes is being shifted around. Some events were shortened, some were apparently skipped over, and some were moved to different points of time with different contexts. Until the rest of Season 3 airs, it will be difficult to tell how extensive the changes will be. However, it seems as if the core story will remain identical to the manga, and will simply be executed differently.

#**Will it be censored?**

Although there were some rumours about Season 3 being censored more than previous seasons, staff members confirmed in [an interview](https://www.snknews.com/post/171764083097/tdkr-cs91939-another-season-3-interview) that the change in network will not affect production. The premiere episode also depicted violent scenes, so it is safe to say that there will be no extra censorship.

#**What will the release schedule be like?**

The episodes will come out one at a time, week by week. There **might** be a break between the first half of the season and the second half (possibly a recap episode like in Season 1), but this is not confirmed.

#**Will it be on Netflix?**

There is no news yet regarding Netflix. Netflix didn't get Season 1 until a long time after it had aired and they still don't have Season 2, so don't get your hopes up.

#**What's with the new opening credits song?**

For this season, the opening song will be ""Red Swan"" by Yoshiki feat. HYDE. This is different from previous seasons, which had their OPs done by Linked Horizon. The full song has not yet been released, and the OP has not yet been played anywhere. [Here is a short teaser.](https://twitter.com/YoshikiOfficial/status/1020260689917575168)

#**I don't remember the story so far, is there a summary?**

[Here is a summary of Season 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/90xr3m/season_1_spoilers_summary_of_season_1/)

[Here is a summary of both seasons.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/90xtyv/anime_spoilers_summary_of_the_events_and/)

Please also consider using [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Attack_on_Titan_episodes) and/or the [Attack on Titan Wiki](http://attackontitan.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Attack_on_Titan_episodes) as well.

#**I want to read the manga, where do I start?** 

Season 1 went up to Chapter 33. Season 2 went up to Chapter 50. So you can start reading from Chapter 51 (the start of Volume 13). There are not many significant differences, other than the final battle of Season 1, some filler, and some characters having different personalities (i.e. in the manga Eren is less angry and Hange is less crazy). The manga releases at a rate of one ~45 page chapter per month, officially on the 8th of each month. Though sometimes the chapters leak a few days early.

#**Where will Season 3 end?**

Based on some advertising and some content from the premiere, it will likely end at Chapter 90 (Volume 22).

#**What about Season 4?**

There is as yet no news about Season 4. Last year, Season 3 was announced immediately after the Season 2 finale. Hopefully the same will happen this year.

#**Will it be good?** 

There's no way I can give a definitive answer to this. This season will be covering 2 arcs, the first of which is somewhat controversial, but the second of which is more widely praised. However, both arcs have their share of fans and critics, and we don’t even know yet what kind of changes will be made to the source material. Ultimately, there are many vastly differing opinions on the quality. You'll have to wait and see, and decide for yourself.

#**Where should I look for official news?** 

[The official website](https://shingeki.tv/season3/) is the main source of announcements and news. Funimation, Crunchyroll, and Anime News Network are also all trustworthy sources. [SNK News](https://www.snknews.com/) is another excellent source of information. News will be posted to /r/ShingekiNoKyojin.

Having been on my university break for quite some time now, I have spent my time arduously attempting to figure out the finale of Attack on Titan. I have created document after document, chatted with other fans, scoured forums; many people have devised some strong theories. However, there is one manga panel that is rarely mentioned and it is one I cannot move past: '**Goth' Mikasa and 'Nerd' Armin (from the Attack on School Castes) appearing in Chapter 120 of the main story.**

&#x200B;

[Here is the panel I am referring to. This shows Eren's PAST memories. Notice the shard in the very top left corner? ](https://preview.redd.it/q1nbd68apwg61.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c812a299881c74a4e263375b25860f3ef9a6333)

[When we zoom in, we can see that this is 'Goth' Mikasa and 'Nerd' Armin. Take note of Mikasa's hairstyle and Armin's glasses...](https://preview.redd.it/7fsn4qicpwg61.jpg?width=361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f8dd811f26bb70cf1b3890d540106716850eeb1)

&#x200B;

[See Mikasa's hairstyle and Armin's glasses?](https://preview.redd.it/b2kwptrfpwg61.jpg?width=463&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7fa63b186b9db1cfdad06707ad6aae6a1e0a986)

For those who are unaware, the 'Attack on School Castes' is an alternate universe where the characters from Attack on Titan live a simple, peaceful life and attend high school. They are included alongside the official manga as 'previews,' and are published at the end of each volume, starting with Volume 21.

Though there are clear comedic purposes to these previews, there are important events that take place in this alternate universe. I will now summarise these quickly, as they serve as the foundation for this theory:

1. In this alternate universe, Eren is seen as a 'nobody,' and is very **bored** with his life. 'Goth' Mikasa and 'Nerd' Armin befriend Eren because he 'protected' them.
2. One day, Eren has a dream that he was fighting a zombie apocalypse at his high school. He woke up from this dream **crying**.
3. After this dream, Eren continually mentions that his life is boring; he wishes that his dream was real, just so his life would be more interesting. He wishes to become a 'threat to all of humanity' just so 'something interesting would happen.' (I'll post this panel below, as I believe it is important).
4. Then Ymir Fritz is on the scene, and she is worshipped as a God. Eren is the only one who can see her.

&#x200B;

[Eren in the Attack on School Castes wishes to become a 'threat to all of humanity' because he is tired of a life where 'nothing happens.' ](https://preview.redd.it/cxarrk5jpwg61.jpg?width=765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78d9a149ce01ae8e536d6a4d6f8ac51d47bb4a9d)

Many have brushed off the memory shard of Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin, stating instead that it's most probably an easter egg. I thought that too, until I stumbled across [this](https://www.snknews.com/post/186889347382/2525-kawakubo-the-initial-draft-isayama-sensei) interview with Isayama:

&#x200B;

>Reporter: What's your favourite fake preview?  
>  
>Isayama: Definitely the High School Caste AU. Even though there are only two pages each time, I spend about five pages worth of time and energy to complete them.  
>  
>Reporter: What’s the appeal of that AU?  
>  
>Isayama: **If possible, I want to draw something that is linked to the original manga’s universe. That’s how I’m approaching it now.**

&#x200B;

The interview was conducted on July 20th, 2019. Chapter 120, where Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin appeared in the past memory shards, was published on August 9th, 2019 - only a few weeks later. This suggests to us that this memory shard was no mere easter egg - but **may potentially open up the possibility of alternate universes in Attack on Titian**. (I also want to emphasise that this interview took place during the Attack on Titan Finale exhibition; whereby fans could get hints for how the manga will end).

&#x200B;

This brings me to the next piece of the puzzle: One of Isayama's [primary sources of inspiration](https://twitter.com/AoTWiki/status/1186777262701441025?s=19) for Attack on Titan is **Muv Luv Alternative**. In fact, he even stated that the [ending](https://comicbook.com/anime/news/attack-on-titan-ending-inspiration-jurassic-park-manga/) was similarly inspired by Muv Luv. Here's the kicker: The Muv Luv franchise is based around **alternate universes.**

So, to investigate further, I watched various Muv Luv play-throughs and scoured their wiki. I discovered that the similarities between Muv Luv and AOT are striking, for example:

* Both stories involve mindless giants; in AOT these are Titans, in Muv Luv these are BETAs (which are aliens).
* Both stories involve 3D manoeuvring gear.
* Both stories have similar arcs.
* In Muv-Luv, there are certain characters who obtained powers as a byproduct of science mishap, and though they are very powerful, they suffer headaches as a result of this; parallels with Mikasa and the Ackerman powers.

However, the most crazy similarity of all is the beginning of Muv Luv Alternative and AOT; both main characters wake up from a dream crying:

&#x200B;

[In Muv Luv, the main character wakes up from a dream crying. This was in reference to waking up from an alternate universe. ](https://preview.redd.it/2cq7lgplpwg61.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=535d929b1fcebf905b30ce57da4c5e7f7f92db3e)

&#x200B;

[In Chapter 1 of AOT, Eren wakes up in a similar way; having experienced the 'longest dream' and also crying. ](https://preview.redd.it/v1pwgm3opwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a1b458093651a3d7bac7f79c803a8e20af8fdaa)

&#x200B;

[Interestingly, Eren had the exact same experience in the Attack on School Castes previews. ](https://preview.redd.it/qhj7pf5rpwg61.jpg?width=734&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08e5d952b3ce86841a6d3bcfbba0b680bdb6df16)

So, knowing all of this, **I devised a theory, linking AOT, the Attack on School Castes and Muv Luv:**

* The memory shard of Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin was in the past. This means Eren was living in the Attack on School Castes alternate universe first.
* In the Attack on School Castes alternate universe, Eren was tired of his boring life and wanted 'something to happen.' He wanted to destroy humanity. This was his wish.
* In the Attack on School Castes, he made a deal with Ymir for this to come true.
* Everything we have seen from the moment Eren woke up in Chapter 1 of the AOT main manga is a result of Eren's wish being fulfilled. This parallels the plot of Muv Luv, the game we know Isayama took great inspiration from.

I then re-read the manga and re-watched the anime in an attempt to either prove/disprove this theory. My verdict is: **it made more sense.** **Way more sense.** I will attempt to explain the plot of AOT (simplified) through this new lens, and this forms the basis of my evidence for this theory:

&#x200B;

1. In the beginning of AOT, Eren expressed the same boredom and desire for [something to happen.](https://imgur.com/wd4EvBA)
2. Then something did happen; the titans. Humanity was being destroyed, just as Eren in the previous High school Universe wished for.
3. Just as in Muv Luv, Eren's memories of a past, alternate universe would have been wiped (which as a side note, would parallel nicely with the implied memory wiping that the 145th King conducted on Eldians). Because of this, Eren believes he is fighting titans, saving humanity, and is none the wiser.
4. Until, however, he kisses Historia's hand. We still don't know all of what Eren saw. However, if this theory is correct, then I am willing to bet he saw that all of this destruction **was his wish from the start** in a past alternate universe. (And I mean, his [face](https://imgur.com/SQsiWOC) doesn't look too happy).
5. This explains the [panel](https://imgur.com/Wm8FqSz) where Eren is talking to Ramzi perfectly. Eren expresses regret over what is to come (ie. The Rumbling) with the words **'I wished for it. I wanted to wipe it all way.'** Wished = past tense. Wanted = past tense.
6. It also explains this [scene](https://imgur.com/Ia5XRSo) where Eren reflects on kissing Historia's hand retroactively. He says 'even if this was set in stone from the start,' and 'even if this is what I wanted.' Again; wanted = past tense.
7. It similarly explains the [scene](https://imgur.com/w7earKQ) with Hange, where Eren seemingly begs them for 'another way.' However, as mentioned before, there is no other way. This was set in stone from the start due to Eren's wish to destroy humanity. All he can do is to keep moving forward.
8. Since kissing Historia's hand, Eren knows this is all his fault. This is why his attitude and demeanour changes drastically since that occasion. It's why he tries to push away his friends. This regret and shame is foreshadowed in the Attack on Castes [panel](https://imgur.com/aqFzW7B), where Eren says (rather grimly) 'it's all because I wanted to destroy the world.'

&#x200B;

So, if Muv Luv led me to discover these parallels, then **can the plot of Muv Luv Alternative similarly predict the ending of Attack on Titan?** (And let's recall, Isayama himself said the ending of AOT is inspired by Muv Luv).

In a nutshell, the ending of Muv Luv Alternative depicts the main character leaving the alternate universe of destruction for his 'previous world'. He loses all of his memories, and everyone will similarly forget him and what he did.

To translate to Attack on Titan:

* Eren won't stay in the current universe of destruction (what we know as the current world of Attack on Titan).
* Everyone will forget him and what he did, and he will travel (most probably) to the Attack on School Castes universe where he previously resided. Presumably, the other characters will 'travel' too.
* In this universe, I believe there will be two options: Eren will 'wake up' as the same age he was in the Attack on School Castes previews, and the last chapter will *also* include a timeskip that shows Eren as an adult; OR, Eren will 'wake up' in this universe and time will have passed (Eren in Chapter 1 was 10, Eren in Chapter 139 will be 19/20; so 10 years will have passed). Eren depicted as an adult is an important detail (and this will be discussed further below).

&#x200B;

The concept of the AOT characters leaving this universe for another has been heavily foreshadowed before (it's just that most of us didn't think to interpret it literally). As shown below (some examples of many):

&#x200B;

[Mention of a 'world we don't know about yet.' ](https://preview.redd.it/uldgbvxvpwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8de0f6ca6d3da2100569d34ea0fdb521a60baa62)

&#x200B;

[This heavily aligns with the theory that Eren wished for this world of destruction, or 'pain and suffering,' yet another world exists. ](https://preview.redd.it/742tgltxpwg61.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b544854b13f8458f2fc3294e7b5403d2764cbb71)

&#x200B;

[This panel is excellent foreshadowing if correct; 'if only those kids could've lived normal lives.' ](https://preview.redd.it/exvnv9yzpwg61.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9da4059d3b6256aa719c16091883444980fa8c1)

&#x200B;

[Here is further foreshadowing of the characters living 'long, happy lives.' Interestingly, though Eren's motivations have long been confusing - his desire for his friends to live 'long, happy lives' has always been made clear. If we also note what Hange said when talking to Levi about running away, she emphasised that even if they returned to Paradis, the 'Jeagirists control the land with the Spinal Fluid.' So, with only 3 chapters left, the only feasible way I can see the AOT characters living 'long, happy lives' is an alternate universe. ](https://preview.redd.it/88m2bu62qwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b3ec544f2a8fc56315bc5718ee2594e3848bd8)

&#x200B;

[This is an image that was shown during the Season 3 ending scene. Many have suspected that these are the young Tybur children in a few years time. However, given the current fashion trends seen in Attack on Titan, these uniforms seen far too modern. So instead, could this foreshadow the Tybur children in the alternate universe \(which we know is set in the 21st century?\)](https://preview.redd.it/6hh041e5qwg61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f076efe6f4551d93837ce3dcd3266748d9dcfc6a)

&#x200B;

[EDITED TO ADD: A user in the comment section also pointed out that in the Akatsuki no Requiem MV \(which appears to foreshadow the ending of AOT\), there is a lot of imagery of a character leaving one world for this city \(seen above\) in an elevator.  Also, if you flip this image to the right side up, the character is actually travelling downwards to this city; parallels nicely with the previous image that says 'underneath this world full of pain and suffering exists another world where light cannot reach.' ](https://preview.redd.it/2fgs5wb7qwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b671166d5172654ace30a80007144a5c3bf512b3)

&#x200B;

However, probably the most striking evidence of all is what Eren says to Ymir in Paths, 'Lend me your strength, I will put an end to **THIS** world.' Grammatically speaking, usually one will say 'I will put an end to THE world,' or 'I will save THE world.' Eren saying he will put an end to THIS world, implies the existence of MORE THAN ONE WORLD.

&#x200B;

[Eren says 'I will put an end to THIS world' rather than I will put an end to THE world. ](https://preview.redd.it/0a9mv1e9qwg61.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b1158cb50544542fc32ba2da47c6c65c2bf14e)

This is also similar to Eren's phrase 'because I was born into **THIS** world.' In fact, when Zeke asks Eren why he is betraying him in Paths and going ahead with the Rumbling, Eren just replies 'because I was born into THIS world.' That's an incredibly vague and weird justification for annihilating the planet - unless you put it into the context of this theory; that Eren is going ahead with the Rumbling because he has no other choice, THIS world of destruction was his wish from the start.

&#x200B;

[Again, born into THIS world, rather than born into THE world. ](https://preview.redd.it/hzzmwiibqwg61.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ebaecb02a5a0146dccc16d17eaf5ef608a22cc)

&#x200B;

Incase you still weren't convinced, take a look at the [Season 4 **opening** song](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/My_War#English_). First thing to note, the cover art for this song is of a modern-day classroom. (**Edit**: As of the start of the month, the official art for the Season 4 song 'My War' was released; it depicts [Ymir Fritz in a modern-age classroom](https://imgur.com/JT5HdQJ), further solidifying this theory). Further, the lyrics of this song seem to parallel perfectly to the occurrences in the **previous** Attack on School Castes universe, right as Eren made a deal with Ymir to destroy the world. See some of the notable lyrics below:

>""Let's **start a new life** from the darkness""  
>  
>""**Destruction** and **regeneration**. **You are the real enemy**.""  
>  
>""Time to leave **school**, stepping in others shadows. When I noticed, I was alone at dawn.""  
>  
>""It's okay to **cry** for now. I have to get ready for **tomorrow**. I have to **do my homework and go to bed. My war.**""

&#x200B;

Contrastingly, the [Season 4 **closing** song](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Shock#English_) appears to foreshadow the ending, whereby Eren and his friends will return back to their previous alternate universe, losing all memories and proof that they ever existed in the universe of destruction (what we see in Attack on Titan); see some of the notable lyrics below:

>""Someone please disperse  
>  
>The **proof that I existed here**  
>  
>Even if my **bones turned to sand** and **disappeared**  
>  
>**I'm alive**.""

&#x200B;

Finally, I want to point out two **'bonus' puzzle pieces.**

&#x200B;

* The **first** puzzle piece is a key detail that many overlook: the story about the miner in Episode 25 of the anime. You can read [Part 1](https://imgur.com/QOHbRrK) and [Part 2](https://imgur.com/liVUjUp) here.

To **summarise** this story that appeared in the anime intermission: There was a miner that originally dreamt of a better life and as such, wanted to dig his way into Wall Sina. He was an expert at digging, doing so for **20 years.** One night, he finally attempted to dig to a better life; but no matter what he did, it was no use. On the brink of giving up, his friend instead insinuated he should accept and be happy with 'his lot in life.' It was then revealed that the miner suddenly disappeared without a trace, even the pit he had dug had disappeared. His friend also vanished, never to be seen again.

As a parallel, Eren Yeager is currently 19 years old. His birthday is March 30, which is directly before the release of the final chapter of Attack on Titan (April 9). Symbolically speaking, Eren will be **20** in the last chapter of the series. This correlates to the 20 years mentioned in the story of the miner; Eren has been trying, fighting and battling for **20 years**, and though it is theorised that he caused this mess in the first place, he too is striving for a **better life** (as he often refers to '**that scenery.'**) That **better life** can be found in an alternate universe, which is why Eren and friends will similarly disappear without a trace (just like the miner and his friend); they will be finally free from the destruction that Eren wished for.

&#x200B;

* The **second** puzzle piece is that the Attack on Titan manga will end with Chapter 139.

This is rather strange, considering that almost all AOT volumes have included 4 chapters and concluded with an even-numbered chapter. Yes, this could simply be a coincidence or an over-sight. However, it's interesting that when looking at [Numerology](https://angelnumber.org/139-angel-number/), the number 139 represents 'the end of a cycle; it is not a 'real' death, but just the end of one period, and therefore the beginning of another.' This perfectly aligns with Isayama's [own words](https://twitter.com/AttackOnFans/status/1347926278914142208?s=20), as when he was asked about the ending of Attack on Titan, he simply replied **'it's just the beginning**!'

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I know what you may be thinking; 'what about the infamous [final panel](https://imgur.com/ksfRDXH)? How does that work with this theory?' This could go a number of ways, but I think a huge clue is the **parallels between Grisha and Eren's love interests.** I will break it down:

* Grisha first married Dina, who is of royal blood.
* They birthed a child, Zeke. This child of royal blood  was born to be utilised as a weapon; arguably not 'free.'
* Grisha, then on the brink of death, was given a second chance at life behind the walls. He then married Carla.
* They birthed a child, Eren. This child wasn't raised to be a weapon, and appears to have an innate desire to achieve freedom (even if that restriction and destruction was implemented by him in the first place).

&#x200B;

So, if this theory is correct, let's look at how this parallels with Eren:

* Eren and Historia appear to be allied together at the moment (a whole separate host of evidence for this, but if I digress this theory will be too long). Notably, Historia is also of royal blood; parallels to Dina.
* It is likely at this stage that Eren is the father of Historia's child (again, also has evidence but too lengthy for here). Unless the titan curse is broken in the next 3 chapters, or so as long as the people of Paradis are considered 'subjects of Ymir,' this child will **not** be born free (and the popular reincarnation theory similarly dictates this to be so); parallels to Zeke.
* However, if Eren and the other AOT characters 'wake up' in the Attack on School Castes alternate universe, where presumably time has passed, it is likely that Eren will have a 'second chance,' similar to Grisha; however, this time with Mikasa. (And for further proof, [this panel](https://imgur.com/YawdvDM) in the Attack on School Castes previews shows that Eren clearly has romantic feelings for Mikasa).
* If Eren and Mikasa have a child together in this alternate universe (where again, presumably time has passed), this child will be truly free - as it was not born in THAT world of destruction that Eren wished for, and has now escaped from. This is what I believe the last panel will show, and this was eerily foreshadowed already (see below):
* **Edit**: Following Chapter 137 and 138, this hypothesis may have changed slightly. See the link under 'Additional Comments' for more information.

&#x200B;

[First, notice what Zeke says; 'no one will cast blame on you for forgetting everything about your first family to enjoy this happy life.' This would foreshadow the ending perfectly if this theory is true; that Eren has forgotten everything about his first family \(Historia\) due to the memory wipe, and now experiences a 'happy' life with Mikasa in the alternate universe. Also, notice how Grisha and baby Eren look eerily similar to the father and child in the final panel? However, Grisha does not have a beard here, whereas the man in the final panel clearly does. Instead, I believe the man in that final panel is Eren \(with a beard\), holding his and Mikasa's child. ](https://preview.redd.it/owdxkfceqwg61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=720bb39cf40cd0fca69a8835a693dc4f7fd63e60)

&#x200B;

To add further credence to the importance of Mikasa and Eren's relationship in the final chapter of Attack on Titan, I would like to highlight an important quote in Muv Luv, said by one of the main love interests:

>You want to meet him again, don't you? Then you should say... 'See you Later. Not goodbye.'

The concept of saying 'See you later' rather than 'Goodbye' is a prominent theme in Muv Luv, and especially pertains to the travel across alternate universes.

Where else have we seen this before? Right at the beginning of AOT:

&#x200B;

[Just like the love interest in Muv Luv, Mikasa says 'see you later,' rather than 'goodbye,' hinting she and Eren will meet again. ](https://preview.redd.it/z586d7igqwg61.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=939016c0e1391431e96c29c232663a5eef57c4e1)

Now, this next part is **purely speculation,** but I believe there could be more to Mikasa's character than we originally suspected:

* We know that as of her father's side, Mikasa is an Ackerman. They are resistant to the powers of the Founding titan; including memory wiping.
* Mikasa is also apart of the 'Oriental' bloodline (through her mother). They are also resistant to the powers of the Founding titan, and again, this includes memory wiping.
* This means that despite being Eldian and able to enter the Paths, both sides of her bloodline are resistant to memory wipes. This puts Mikasa in a very unique position.
* And, when you think about it, the plot point that some clans (such as the Ackerman's and the Oriental Clan) are resistant to the memory wipes has been rather fruitless and purposeless so far. It was not used to reveal any information on the outside world - so why else would Isayama include this detail?
* We know that in Muv Luv, when characters exited an alternate universe, their memories were wiped. What if, when travelling from the previous (Attack on School Castes) universe to the AOT universe (what we see in Chapter 1), Mikasa's memories were not fully wiped?
* This would explain [this panel](https://imgur.com/ZNc5g1A) in Chapter 9 where Mikasa says Armin's abilities have saved them 'many times in the past,' and Armin is confused as to when this occurred.
* Similarly, [this panel](https://imgur.com/lOWAeYS) of Mikasa saying 're-opening the same old wound... do I really have to start everything anew **yet again**?
* What is most convincing are [these panels](https://imgur.com/M2rzpXu) in Chapter 6. Mikasa sees Eren is being choked, and she says 'I'd seen this scene before, over and over again.' She then follows this up in the next panel, talking about the 'cruelty of **THIS** world.' Again, saying THIS world, rather than THE world.
* Most importantly is the phrase '**come back home**,' of which Mikasa says to Eren [multiple times](https://imgur.com/n6Y6Hyg) throughout the manga. Instead of interpreting it literally, what if Mikasa is referring to 'home' as the previous alternate universe in which they came from?
* In fact, in [Mikasa's character song](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/No_matter_where_you_are), there are multiple important lyrics that link to this theory and going 'back home' with Eren:

>""  When I woke up again, At that moment… I found you""  
>  
>""You are my home to return to, no matter where you are.""

&#x200B;

* In linking with this, the OST 'Name of Love' also potentially foreshadows this theory and Eren and Mikasa meeting again at the finale:

>""**Goodbye world**. Our shadows, standing side by side, do not cross each other.""  
>  
>""somewhere in this world, **if we can meet in the future,** please dont forget... about me""

&#x200B;

Tbh, I am not 100% sure whether Mikasa has retained her memories or not. Irrespective of this, if this alternate universe theory proves to be true, then I still believe it is likely that the final chapter will include Mikasa and the scarf, and the phrase 'lets go home' when going back to the original alternate universe. (**Edit**: Following Chapter 137 and 138, this part of the theory takes on a different interpretation, again see the link at the bottom).

&#x200B;

**Now, answering some of the questions/complaints I can anticipate in the comments:**

* **""A parallel universe is unlikely and comes out of no where.""**

Not necessarily true. The fact that Eren was able to change Grisha's memories without causing a paradox implies that multiple or alternative universes can indeed exist. Further, there have been various hints throughout the series already; such as the Paths and the ability to transcend time, as well as all the symbolism of rebirth and second chances (especially in the latest manga chapters).

**Edit**:  A user in the comment section pointed out the use of a fixed-timeline in AOT, meaning the future cannot be changed. This doesn't mean that alternate universes can't exist, as for example, Paths is quite literally a metaphysical alternate universe; but important to note regarding the above statement.

* **""Eren and Ymir making a deal in the Attack on School Castes (previous/original universe) seems like a reach.""**

Well, have you considered the [original painting](https://imgur.com/bt0vgPj) of Ymir and the Devil, making some sort of deal? We know that Founder Ymir gained her titan powers from an unknown organic material when falling into the tree... so what else could these paintings be depicting, I wonder? And let's not forget who is currently seen as the Devil... (\*cough Eren\*).

Further, it's rather interesting; Ymir was the original 'Founding Titan,' meaning she had the ability to wipe all memories. If she was the one involved with Eren in the School Castes universe (where she is viewed as a 'God'), and partook in his deal,  this could explain how the new universe (and subsequently wiped memories of the previous universe) came to be. Further, I believe that in Norse Mythology, 'Ymir' was symbolic of the creation of Earth; this could potentially be excellent symbolism of the role Ymir Fritz plays in the creation/manipulation of the two universes I am theorising about.

Additionally, and this might be the most concrete proof of all; if we go back to the Chapter 120 manga panel with the memory shards of Eren's **past** (the one with Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin), down the bottom left is Ymir Fritz. Eren hadn't met her yet, so why was she in Eren's past memories at this stage? Unless, of course, they'd already met in a previous alternate universe to make the aforementioned 'deal.'

&#x200B;

[Ymir Fritz in the Chp 120 memory shard panel; depicting Eren's 'past' memories. ](https://preview.redd.it/howslmqiqwg61.png?width=228&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd397ac18435ccc318f38e076e6b9dc59f680ebe)

As a final note; the first Chapter of AOT when Eren wakes up from his 'dream' is titled, 'To you, 2000 years from now,' and then the Chapter when Eren finally reunites with Ymir Fritz is titled 'From you, 2000 years ago.' What does Eren say in the latter chapter? **It ends now.**

**""Okay, but why The Rumbling? It doesn't seem like Ymir or Eren want this.""**

This is the one thing that Isayama would be yet to explain, and is a probable reason as to why Eren and Ymir's true motivations and points of view have been shrouded in mystery. However, if we theorise that Eren made a deal with Ymir in the past alternate universe to 'destroy humanity,' then Eren must fulfil this deal and either complete that mission, or be killed in the process. This was hinted already during the [scene](https://imgur.com/9DX2aMk) where Eren Kurger says to Grisha 'if you want to save Armin and Mikasa, then you need to fulfil your mission.' If we know that attack titan inheritors are connected- then perhaps was this meant for Eren? Is this why he 'keeps moving forward?'

* **""But I've seen X, Y, Z theory and it sounds much more plausible.""**

The beauty of this theory is that there will be essentially two endings; a conclusion to the universe we see in Attack on Titan (most likely Chapter 137 and 138), and then a conclusion to the entire story (Chapter 139), of which I predict will be Eren and co. travelling back to their previous universe and finally being 'free.' So, your favourite theory within the AOT universe could still happen.

* **""There's only a few chapters left, I doubt this will happen.""**

Actually, the fact that there are only a few chapters left strengthens this theory. Just as in Muv Luv, and just as in that story of the miner digging under the wall - the characters suddenly vanish. 3 chapters is not a lot of space to tie up every last loose end, but this isn't needed if Eren and his friends suddenly travel to their previous universe.

Also, consider again the picture of the Tybur children in the school uniform. They are a little older in that photo (maybe 5-7 years or so older). If the last panel is of Eren holding Historia's baby (with no alternate universes), then you'd also need to have a time skip to show these Tybur children... that doesn't work out. However, if there is an alternate universe where time has passed... it does.

* **""Isayama said the story doesn't have a happy ending, this is a happy ending!""**

Isayama actually [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/c9phsx/manga_spoilers_final_exhibition_interview_with/) he wanted to betray the reader. I also think this ending will shock a lot of people, and potentially be quite controversial. Interestingly, Isayama included a little text bubble in the Attack on School Castes that said, with no real context, ""I do feel ashamed about the reveal being a dream."" (See below).

&#x200B;

[Does this hint that Eren in the final chapters will wake up in the previous universe, memories lost - just like Chapter 1? Is this the big 'reveal' that Isayama is 'ashamed' of?](https://preview.redd.it/5ok6li3lqwg61.jpg?width=175&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ba13a98c1556d1f622aaa70ce177ea0f36e28d1)

* **""From a narrative point of view, this ending sucks. It's cliche and I've seen it done before.""**

First and foremost, I don't think Isayama could ever create an ending where everyone is happy (I mean, just look at the divide in the community between Jeagerist and Alliance supporters). However, I do think he could create an ending that no one would expect - and this theory is exactly that. Yes, there are plenty of isekai animes, or stories involving alternative universes - but it seems that most of these characters travel in time/space for benevolent reasons. I personally haven't seen a story where a character travels to an alternate universe purely to destroy it, just because he was 'bored' and 'wanted something to happen.' It would also mean that for over a decade, Eren was the true villain of the story, and we were none the wiser. What better way to betray your readers than that?

* **How would this work for the anime-only viewers?**

To date, there are only \~10 School Caste previews. It's looking likely that there may be a Season 4, Part 2. In this instance, the School Caste previews could still be animated (perhaps as part of the ending theme, as these usually foreshadow events to come).

However, even if these previews aren't animated, as you can tell from the absurd length of this post (sorry!), there is still significant evidence that exists outside of these previews.

So I watched the final episode, trying my hardest to avoid the politics of ending haters and defenders. 

I did something most AOT fans wouldn't dare; form my own opinion. 

And as someone who's read the manga ending and never shuts  up about it +2 years later, I have to give my hats off to Mappa.

They made a shitty ending... into a servicable one. 

Not a good ending, fuck no. Just less aggressively terrible. 

It added nuance to Eren's nonspecific motivations, added much needed context to the world after the rumbling, fixed the atrocious pacing and dialogue of chapter 139 and allowed for the series to have the feeling of finality the manga sorely lacked. 

Additionally, the Yelena cameo at the end further showed that our concerns of the ending were addressed and fixed in post. For that I can say amazing work. 

The production quality was top-notch, ignoring a few oddities, so there are no complaints about that either. I especially loved the final sequence of Levi and Mikasa making their final assault against Eren's Collassal Titan, gliding through the fire with the OST hyping up the mood.

On the surface level, they've polished all the aspects of the ending that made it so divisive. So of course, people are quick to praise the ending. 

""10/10 kino! Isayama is HIM!"" Twitter wankery. 
And I don't blame them, because the episode was *good*. 

Superfically. 

But, a turd polished is still a smelly turd, and I will bullet point why:

• Eren's motives for why he thought The Rumbling was the only way to ensure his friends happiness is undermined by admitting that he was too stupid to figure out a better solution. Not explanations of Paths or other external factors, but Eren's own naivety towards his preconception of freedom. However, being vague about this doesn't create the intended effect. Rather than portray Eren troubled and conflicted, it shows the writer's wrote themselves into the corner and needed to flanderise Eren's naivety in order to awkwardly assert that Eren was ""A slave to Freedom"". This juxtaposes his development pre/post time skip, where (facade or otherwise), there clearly was a maturation of his resolve. I feel conflicted about this change. 

•Carla's death is still used for cheap shock value. It adds nothing to the narrative except to show how far Eren would go to achieve his goals (like mass genocide isn't enough proof, matricide via time travel is). This is still a frustrating oversight from the writers, it would make more sense for Armin to have the emotional breakdown with Eren about Carla's death rather than the The Rumbling. There was so much room to improve this, yet they did nothing with that information.

•Eren and Mikasa's relationship is as undefined as it is uncomfortable for me. The only reason I dislike Eremika is because its spoonfed to me as this tragic romance, when in reality its watching two Oblivion NPCs attempt to simulate chemistry. I felt nothing when Eren and Mikasa where in Paths (which makes no sense because Ackerman's are immune to memory manipulation???). I felt awkward when Mikasa was bawling over her step brother. I felt nauseous when she kissed his FRESH DECAPTITATED HEAD. The romance being a main factor towards the end didn't sit well with me, because it focused on the weakest character dynamic in the story, honestly. 

•Why did Ymir choose Mikasa? I still fail to see the parallel despite obsessive love. Which for Ymir's case is beyond fucked up, considering she was used as a concubine for King Fritz. The anime still did not develop this parallel adequately at left me more confused about the whole affair. 

•Armin doesn't directly endorse genocide anymore, this is the best change out of all of them, which I am grateful for. But even so, he seems to accept Eren's decision to kill 80% of humanity rather than be critical of it. It's both in and out of character, which unintentionally adds to the surrealism of it all. I wish they extended this scene. And fucking talk about Carla. 

• The cynicism of the ending made me feel empty. Reading the manga I died laughing about the whole thing because of how rushed and awkward 139 was. Now, I don't even feel any form of emotions. 

•...and many more, this is all things at the top of my head.

The anime  ending is an improvement. Don't let the haters tell you otherwise. But it's not a masterpiece. 

Its sealed the cracks of a broken, musky wall, calling it a day with a new coat of paint. 

But it wasn't the paint, the foundations where the issues. 

And this ending, doesn't address my major concerns. That's why I still hate it.

From sources other than Paolo, but he's gone dark and one of these sources, which is corroborating what another one is saying, is kind of reliable.

Small things first:

Episode 9 (End's Eve) will have its OP cut in order to fit all the content in it. This makes sense, as Chapter 127 has a lot of [dialogue density](https://preview.redd.it/e4o4s2gfm2981.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cad3731926006ccde2bad724f010c43cfd8a0e3), even more than Chapter 125 which was so long that they had to have a scene play over the ED in the anime.

Episode 10 title -- Traitor

This is more widespread, but it's Chapter 128's title. Makes sense.

Episode 11 title -- **Retrospective**

This is Chapter 129's title. A big surprise to me, as I figure a whole battle of action isn't enough for an entire episode but I guess we're reverting back to painfully slow pacing.

Episode 12 title -- **Dawn of Humanity**

Chapter 130's title. An even slower episode, if it were just covering that chapter which is very short due to the many double page spreads of titan destruction, but...

*Episode 12 will cover Chapter 123's flashback*.

The leaker for this has said they are 99-100% sure on this. While this is good that Ramzi will not be introduced the same chapter he's killed off, and that we're actually getting Mikasa's POV before the movie, the bad news is...

*Chapter 131 (Rumbling) will not be covered in Part 2.*

This is something Paolo hinted at for a while that he was becoming less sure the anime would include Chapter 131, thinking it might end at Chapter 130 indeed. And in spite of all of the hints to the chapter in the OP and ED, it seems this might be true.

So this leaves 9 chapters for Final Season: Part 3, *or* a final movie. Whatever the continuation of the anime is.

[Some of the noted clues \(among others\) that a sequel is in store. ](https://preview.redd.it/rc5tjtb6v5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdec20d57aec8f4539f3637267d0486607ed1089)

This makes sense, and aligns with Isayama's own words; when asked about the ending of AOT earlier this year, Isayama simply [replied](https://twitter.com/AttackOnFans/status/1347926278914142208) '**it's just the beginning!**'

However, what doesn't make sense is how the story can be continued in its current state. As we all know, Paradis was destroyed. Does this mean Isayama is just going to kick off with random characters, in a decimated country, doomed to repeat the same mistakes yet again?

I doubt it, and here's why; in a 2014 (lesser known) [interview](https://isolilili.tumblr.com/post/85507735030/my-pocket-x-shingeki-no-kyoijin-isayama?fbclid=IwAR2NQ6RiV2MseuXS7576Q3WQ1tEK1qFSVW8xsHpz90iR3RZcbRofFXp6e4Y), Isayama said this when asked about the future of the manga:

>**""I still plan on deceiving the fans.""**

Perhaps he is talking about the future plot twists he had planned, but, what if he isn't? **What if the story of Eren Yeager is really, just the beginning**[?](https://imgur.com/hqzKdDc)

&#x200B;

Although I had a 'gut feeling' that Isayama was deceiving us in some capacity, I could never pin-point any evidence, and for the most part, brushed the idea off. However, that all changed when I came across a [2016 post](http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazime/archives/9324702.html?fbclid=IwAR3P85ZmIBUIhrXq8tf3_Lag5zhqDnFOA1Mh0AALXLXsYh1yvMxORvv9OoE) from Isayama's own blog, where he credited the video game 'Life is Strange' as the inspiration for both the High School Castes AU and **Chapter 84**; the chapter that decides whether Armin or Erwin should receive the titan serum.

For context, Life is Strange tells the story of a girl who can **rewind time** to change the outcome of various events. As she does this, her surroundings *literally* rewind and everything goes into reverse (you can see an example of this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxX4OWblybA)). This may sound familiar, as a very similar thing occurred in the ending of AOT Episode 49; this is what many people refer to as the special 'glitch' ending, where suddenly the music starts to '**rewind**' and a series of images are played in reverse (if you're not sure what I am talking about, you can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/Eq10RTSXYyc)). Then, after this glitch, we are given a small preview into a future episode to come, and you guessed it, it's the episode detailing the events of **Chapter 84.**

**So, to summarise:** The AOT ending in which time **rewinds** shows a glimpse of the episode for Chapter 84; the very chapter Isayama said was inspired by Life is Strange, a story also about time **rewinding**.

[The top picture is a snippet from the 'glitch' ending \(S3\) in which time rewinds, the bottom picture is the first page of Chapter 84, the very chapter that Isayama said was inspired by Life is Strange; a video game about rewinding time. ](https://preview.redd.it/r8z43nz9v5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78ac91bc56bfbfcbbc8e730cc9b682634f416f6a)

In my opinion, this is far too specific to be merely a coincidence. In combination with a plethora of other evidence (which will be detailed below), there is a strong case that some **mind-bending, timeline-shifting, alternate realty stuff is going on here,** **and we are about to see the next instalment of this in a surprise continuation of the manga; allowing Isayama to truly adhere to his promise of deceiving his fans.**

It sounds far fetched, but hear me out.

# The Muv Luv Trilogy

^(As a side note, I have not personally played any of the Muv Luv games, I have only read about the plot through the Wiki, so feel free to correct me if I am mistaken.)

As many are probably aware, Isayama took great inspiration from the Muv Luv *adult* visual novels (stories that revolve around the premise of alternate universes), even going so far as [admitting](https://imgur.com/BLrjYIw) that he 'ripped them off.' If interested, a more detailed analysis comparing the two stories can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/kxbevu/how_shingeki_was_heavily_inspired_by_muv_luv/).

Regardless, this fact spurred on countless theories, including my own [Alternate Universe Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/ldfsg3/the_alternate_universe_ending_theory_a_complete/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that gained minor traction earlier in the year. However, I made one critical mistake when devising this theory; I assumed that the story of Attack on Titan was following the plot of Muv Luv Alternative, rather than it's predecessor, **Muv Luv Unlimited.**

\[Muv Luv Spoilers\] >!At the conclusion of Muv Luv Unlimited, although a small portion of humanity is able to escape to a new planet, the majority is annihilated by both alien (BETA) attacks and the increasing hostility of the environment; similar to the dire situation caused by Eren and the Rumbling in AOT.  The final monologue in MLU also bears a striking resemblance to some of the more iconic phrases in Attack on Titan, as shown in the image below:   !<

[Although it may seem trivial, the theme of saying 'See you later' by the MC's love interest is recurring in both Muv Luv and AOT. ](https://preview.redd.it/ql3p426iv5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb4ca4753e77e68803443b13db1eb5709ef01e86)

>!However, what we see in Muv Luv Alternative, the follow-up visual novel published 3 years later (a similar premise to what I am suggesting with the 'surprise' continuation of the AOT manga), is the main character waking up, right back where he started in the beginning of Muv Luv Unlimited. Although he originally assumes it must be a dream, he soon realises that he has been given a chance to re-do the events in Unlimited; this time, choosing a path that better saves humanity. Interestingly, below is a photo of how he wakes up, which again, bares a great resemblance to a famous Attack on Titan scene: !<

[Both main characters from both Muv Luv and Attack on Titan wake from a 'long dream' that they can no longer remember, whilst also crying. ](https://preview.redd.it/bc8n6y3nv5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8a77e46c8c74af4104323a839ee747aad8fdbde)

The key takeaway: If true to his word about taking heavy inspiration from Muv Luv, as well as the mechanisms for alternate realities already being established in AOT (discussed later), there is a chance that Isayama may pull a >!Muv Luv Alternative!<, and continue the next instalment of the manga in a different timeline, with different choices.

After all, a similar concept was hinted at multiple times in the manga:

https://preview.redd.it/kn82slnwv5f71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c15c07d2407ffa8d6c8fa72986d9dd291848f78

# Life is Strange

Although I have already stated the connection between the S3 ending glitch, Chapter 84 and Life is Strange, it's important to mention that the proposition of Isayama continuing the manga to showcase a different timeline, in which different choices were made, is the *exact* same premise of Life is Strange; a video game that Isayama considers to be a 'masterpiece.'

It is also worth noting that one of the key symbols in the Life is Strange game is the butter-fly. This is a common symbol of the 'butter-fly effect,' which postulates that if you travel back in time and change anything, it has a ripple effect. Interestingly, the L o s t  G i r l s novel (created by the writer for the AOT anime, and supervised by Isayama) includes this very butter-fly, while also describing an alternate reality that Mikasa visits; one where her parents were never killed.

[Above is the butter-fly from Life is Strange, below is the butter-fly from the novel \(and subsequent O V A\); both stories involve alternate realities. ](https://preview.redd.it/p0a8whe5w5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e66b922b35c355faef90ff512c58c68ff15a051a)

Again, including something like this doesn't seem like a coincidence.

In fact, if it is true that Isayama will continue the manga using some sort of different timeline, it reminds me of what the S4 opening singer said during his live video (who, as a close friend of Isayama, was supposedly told how the story ends); **hinting that there will be more to the story of AOT than we originally anticipated.**

https://preview.redd.it/tr4x7jydw5f71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03f02744d6579d120faf4bd3354ea2090c9be77e

# The Eternal Champion:

Some observant fans were quick to point out the explicit similarities between AOT and the fantasy novel 'The Eternal Champion.' Such similarities were so stark that at one point, fans of the novel were calling for the author to be alerted on the basis of copyright infringement.

Although such a connection was never confirmed by Isayama himself, many have analysed the connection between the two stories. If interested, more information can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/ind7rk/the_book_the_eternal_champion_is_ridiculously/).

However, the reason I mention this is that you guessed it - the Eternal Champion is a story based on **alternate realities and timeline switching.**

# Norse Mythology: Rangnarok

As outlined in Chapter 22 of the manga, it is directly [stated](https://imgur.com/09sSwQw) that Attack on Titan draws inspiration from Norse Mythology (for example, the naming of 'Ymir').

Further, as many on this subreddit have pointed out, the Rumbling is akin to Ragnarok; both symbolic of the final destruction of the world. In fact, I couldn't help but notice the uncanny resemblance between a famous painting depicting the last moments of Ragnarok, and Fort Salta, where the final battle took place in AOT.

[Top: Interpretive painting of the final scene in Ragnarok \(Wikipedia\). Bottom: Fort Salta, where the final battle during the Rumbling took place. ](https://preview.redd.it/2z5sjfxfw5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ea6438573bd4347f51c82497bc84b5e94ff5223)

However, what is often less reported, is what comes *after* Ragnarok; **a new world** (often debated to be cyclical in nature).

Although subjective, I don't believe that the bombing of Paradis is a great representation of a 'new world,' but the continuation of the AOT story in a new timeline is. Afterall, the Yggrasil tree, in which the different **worlds** or 'realms' in Norse Mythology are connected, bears a striking resemblance to the infamous 'titan' tree in Attack on Titan.

In linking with this, the idea of rebirth and new beginnings is heavily foreshadowed in the later chapters of the AOT manga, yet as of Chapter 139, this never came to fruition. This was most prominently seen in Zeke Yeager's final moments, whereby he stated '**I wouldn't mind being born once more after all;**' an odd thing to say, considering this was never explored further. That is, unless, a continuation of the story is yet to come.

[Zeke wouldn't mind being 'born once more after all.' What does this mean?](https://preview.redd.it/279ziqvlw5f71.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=40229cb9af60f3af81b75e226bceecf26028e18f)

Additionally, Linked Horizon released a [bonus track](https://youtu.be/PKg1GDJK1ZE) for the AOT soundtrack titled 'Kimi ga Fusawashii to Omou Daimei.' In this song, the lyrics appear to ask someone if they want to be reborn, or if they would rather erase their existence; in the end, the sound of a baby crying can be heard. Although many believed this song to be proof that Ymir would be reincarnated, this did not happen; nor does this song appear to have any relevance to Historia's child. However, one of the last lines of lyrics reads '**are you free?**' a question usually only applicable to our very own Eren Yeager. Could this hint at something more?

&#x200B;

Despite all of this, you may be thinking...

# 'I thought the timeline in AOT was fixed?'

This appears to be a contentious subject. Many people are of the opinion that everything in the AOT world is pre-determined, and there *is* solid evidence for this fact.

However, there are points for the contrary; for example, if everything truly was pre-determined, Eren would have no need to intervene with Dina (to make her eat Carla), as it would have happened regardless. Similarly, Eren would have had no need to persuade Grisha to take the Founding Titan, as he would have done it regardless (which we know was not the case). Besides, the very fact that Eren was able to enter Grisha's memories and change the outcome was not possible unless Eren had the Founding Titan to begin with (as Zeke calls him 'the key'); this creates a paradox, unless of course, we factor in **alternate realities and differing timelines** as well.

Irrespective of this debate, the very fact that Isayama connected the final School Castes AU to the main story also hints that alternate realities are indeed a possibility in the world of Attack on Titan.

# So, what does this all mean?

I know what you may be thinking: 'Eren is dead, this isn't possible.' \[Steins;Gate spoilers\] >!However, as seen in Steins;Gate, Mayuri is killed repeatedly and no efforts can save her - perhaps in a similar way to Eren, his death is 'pre-determined.' However, to resolve this issue, the MC of Steins;Gate travels to a different timeline/reality to avoid this; evidently, similar to the concept that this theory is putting forward. !<

With this in mind, anything is possible. As some fans have already suggested, perhaps the child in the final page of the manga will have some sort of significance in relation to this? Perhaps the aforementioned 'glitch' ending that featured Chapter 84 (the Armin vs Erwin titan serum conundrum) is of notable importance, and it will explore a worldline in which Erwin remained alive instead?

However, what makes more sense to me is the **existence of an Eren in a different timeline** who has already been introduced into the manga (unbeknownst to the reader, *so far*), or has already diverged timelines at an earlier stage (eg. an Eren living in a world in which Carla was alive), and the story will simply pick back up with Eren waking up in a different alternate reality (most probably reminiscent of how he woke up in Chapter 1).

# A multiverse Eren makes sense...

It may sound outlandish, until you remember that it has **already been done**. As seen in the photo below, Ymir from the original AOT universe was present in the School Castes AU world, alongside her School Castes AU self (older and with children). Interestingly, only Eren could see her. Is this an easter egg for something else to come?

[Two Ymir's exist in the same universe. ](https://preview.redd.it/iphjit3ow5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0f9c4133035d7e9687905d8495943be4c402820)

In linking with this, this infamous [music video](https://youtu.be/OrQ0zZArUV8) similarly depicts what appears to be an older and younger version of the same person travelling between two worlds. Although I am hesitant to comment on this video (as I know many people have strong opinions on it), I do believe the end of Chapter 139 did not yet explain the relevance of this video, so it is still open for interpretation.

[An older version of the bird \(left\) and younger version sit together. ](https://preview.redd.it/215nulgrw5f71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1a0952d95f1c5963f13e51b5e7e8943476d880a)

Importantly, if it was revealed that there was one (or multiple) Eren Yeager's in differing, interacting worldlines all along, this opens up the possibility of correcting what many people deem to be plot holes.

For example, one of the primary complaints about Chapter 139 was Eren's **motives** (and supposed 'character assassination.') Many questioned that if the timeline is indeed fixed, why did Eren not use that as an explanation for the Rumbling (rather than, 'I don't know why')? If the timeline wasn't fixed, why did he 'wish' for the Rumbling, despite simultaneously not wanting to hurt others, and apologising for doing so (as detailed below)?

[Eren states multiple times that the Rumbling is what he wanted \(and contradicts this later\), yet it also simultaneously appears as if he had no choice - why is this the case? ](https://preview.redd.it/gyvnf2juw5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4724cbdcfca6b11d81b5e5aaa66fba2d1cf610f4)

**However, what if instead, there was a multiverse Eren visiting the current Eren, yet this was kept from the reader?** (Similar to how Eren 'visiting' Grisha was also kept from the readers for a majority of the manga). It would explain why the current Eren didn't appear to want to go through with the Rumbling, nor did he have an explanation, but rather, it was what he (his alternate universe self) requested (probably for a reason yet to be revealed in the differing world line); hence why the phrases such as 'I wanted to wipe it all away' now make sense - **it** ***still*** **is Eren, just not the Eren in this timeline.**

It could also explain why Eren chose to go through with directing Dina to eat Carla. Although Eren unlocked the power of the Founding Titan, that is, to experience the past and future all at once, that does not necessarily give him the power to glimpse into all the possible outcomes (ie. to kill Carla or not) and if he could, that implies the existence of multiple timelines/realities regardless.

However, an Eren from a timeline where Carla was not killed would have this knowledge (and if this *other* timeline is simultaneously still 'fixed', this other Eren would obtain the founder in this separate world as well, if it was so required). This is further exemplified by Eren's own words in the final chapter; interestingly, as soon as he is about to explain 'who' led Dina to Carla, he is cut off - whilst this doesn't necessarily confirm anything, it certainly leaves the possibility open.

[Eren never finished his sentence explaining who directed Dina to kill Carla. ](https://preview.redd.it/vj5qbz10x5f71.jpg?width=827&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2bcff5872239847df3396a47035451351744c73)

Additionally, **it would also explain all the memory shards that were left without explanation**. As there was already a memory shard of [Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin](https://imgur.com/v8hbVAS) in the main manga, indicating that Eren was granted a glimpse into his alternate self in the School Castes AU world, this opens up the possibility of Eren's connection to yet another (or multiple) alternate versions of himself.

# What would be the point of continuing the story in a different timeline?

Although this is just a theory, if correct, it leaves open so many possibilities for Isayama to explore. Perhaps the things left unexplained were done so on purpose? After all, if everything was wrapped up, how could a sequel of any sort eventuate?

Maybe the differing worldline will be the same (with one minor change, such as Carla not being killed), or perhaps the alternate world/s will be totally different?

Although these are just 'guesses,' here are some of the things I believe could be explored in an alternate worldline (or at the very least, would be cool to see):

&#x200B;

1. **The Hizuru Royal Family inheriting the power of the titans instead of the Fritz's.**

Many agree that Mikasa's connection to the Hizuru family could have been a monumental plot point, yet ended up being rather futile. That is, unless, it is paving the way for a story yet to come.

In linking with this, I can't help but think of [ED 1](https://youtu.be/QBlYYOsdG-U), in which the animation of Mikasa bore a striking resemblance to the story of Ymir.

[The left side depicts the ED 1 animation \(Mikasa\), and the right side is a comparison with the story of Ymir. ](https://preview.redd.it/kp1haae3x5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db840f4dc6eb45692bdba6cde5b508fbfdb97afd)

As of Chapter 139 we know that in *some* capacity Mikasa and Ymir are connected - what if there's more to their story than meets the eye?

2.  **Sasha as a mindless titan.**

I know this sounds ridiculous - but hear me out. Earlier on, a collection of short stories were published in which each character had a 'dream' about an alternate life they lived (you can read them [here](https://snk-smartpass.tumblr.com/post/188436131579/good-night-dear-and-sweet-dreams-goodnight)). For example, Mikasa dreamt of a world in which her parents never died (which interestingly, was again explored in the Lost Girls OVA).

On the other hand, Sasha dreamt that she was a mindless titan; something that would possibly explain her inexplicable hunger. Whilst I would never wish this on a character, the anime makes several juxtapositions between Sasha and mindless titans (as seen below). Is this just for fun, or a hint at something more?

https://preview.redd.it/08kmuib8x5f71.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3aa5c0a9035206bd911f1d28f403afea1f5e1863

**Other plot points that could be further explored:**

* Kruger's words about 'the same mistakes' always 'repeating;' we are still missing clarification about what he meant.
* Alternate Eren heeding Kruger's words about 'loving someone inside the walls.'
* The 'past' Attack Titan holder Grisha was referring to.
* What Eren showed Grisha.
* The Ice-burst stone.
* Titan biology and Hange's experiments.
* ... really anything - **the possibilities are endless.**

# Bonus (crack) theory: 

I couldn't help but notice this similarity between the **first chapter** of the manga, and the **very last School Castes** AU; perhaps the next iteration of AOT will be more modern than we think?

[Both the first chapter of the AOT manga and the final School Castes make reference to a period of 100 year peace without titans; yet we know from the manga what happens next. ](https://preview.redd.it/gt7lryi6p7f71.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51eb51e56feb786b3e0462d3aba32aa6d8ce6397)

Is it then no coincidence that as of June 2021, Kodansha posted ***this*** advertisement for the final volume of Attack on Titan? 

[Eren popping up in the 21st century. ](https://preview.redd.it/3m6b0y1qp7f71.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc0d43793b434f3471654c16d9c9f2fab8c44f99)

# Responses to the comments I can already anticipate:

**""Just say you hate the ending and move on.""**

Although this may be an unpopular opinion on this subreddit, I actually enjoyed the final chapter. Admittedly I was a little confused for a day or two, but I quickly appreciated it for what it was and haven't touched titanfolk, nor anything AOT related since (not out of anger, just busy with other parts of my life).

As such, this theory is not borne out of hatred for the ending. I am not posting this because I think it needs fixing, but rather there is a sense of incompleteness to the series that I can't shake, and I wanted to explore that further.

&#x200B;

**""C o P i U m"".**

As above.

&#x200B;

**""What about an anime original ending?""**

While anything is possible, I would personally prefer the manga to continue in the way I have suggested instead of changing the anime - that way, we still get to explore a 'new' story/ending, and the anime can still stay true to the source material.

Which, speaking of 'new' endings...

[Taken from the AOT Final Exhibition, teasing how the story will end \(which, as a side note, many of the elements shown in this exhibition still have not been addressed\). ](https://preview.redd.it/e0h77g6j96f71.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46a9910625bc960b90751a51cfb12535dc779a95)

&#x200B;

**""This won't happen.""**

I never said it will. It's just a theory that I put together for my own enjoyment.

I personally loved reading all the theories prior to Chapter 139, and I am hoping there are others who share the same enthusiasm for exploring all the possibilities that can still come from this story.

**If many fans are in agreement that AOT will continue in some capacity, I think all cards should be on the table. I  personally believe it to be unlikely that a sequel would take the form of random characters in a decimated Paradis.**

**Instead, given all of Isayama's connections to alternate universe/time-line shifting stories, why not take the story to the next level?**

**Episode 1 - Judgment:** Cold open with the remainder of **Chapter 115**. We then see **Chapter 117** play out ending with Zeke’s return.

**Episode 2 - Sneak Attack:** **Chapter 118** + a small portion of **Chapter 119**. [I can see this panel being a good ending point.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935126022_f954e63250_o.png)

**Episode 3 - Two Brothers:** Alright, I’m starting to lose my hopium that we’re gonna see anime onlies experience the 119 cliffhanger and hear me out, it’s probably best for the pacing. I truly can’t think of a scenario that either isn’t rushed or sluggish in order to get that. I’m thinking we see the rest of **Chapter 119** [up to this point in Chapter 120. ](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935130652_4a52950e78_o.jpg)This will be peak shenanigans.

**Episode 4 - Memories of the Future:** The remainder of **Chapter 120** until [this point in Chapter 121.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935016911_48fc531254_o.jpg)

**Episode 5 - From You, 2000 Years Ago:** This episode’s structure seems to be the most concrete in terms of the leaks. We’ll be seeing the remainder of **Chapter 121** + **Chapter 122** + Eren’s speech at the end of **Chapter 123**. If this ends up being true, it’s basically a lock for the GOAT episode.

**Episode 6 - Island Devils:** **Chapter 123** flashback scenes + [124 up until this point](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935025006_f7c1224211_o.jpg). Ending with a sendoff to our big brained king Pyxis would be a cool way to finish this one. I think it’s gonna be kind of weird to see Annie’s dad again yet not her reveal but I don’t know how they’d cram that into one episode.

**Episode 7 - Sunset:** Cold open with the rest of [Chapter 124 until this panel](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50934339433_7a5548ccaa_o.jpg). This would be the long awaited Annie-centric episode that would adapt the rest of **Chapter 124** and culminate to ending with our famous pie scene in **Chapter 125.** The second half of the episode will adapt the rest of 125.

EDIT 12/25: I got the pie scene mixed up with the 126, I’m the least confident in eps 6 & 7 as I think they’ll have by far the most restructuring.

**Episode 8 - Pride:** **Chapter 126**, rumored to have it’s own episode. This one’s pretty wordy and could benefit from some slower pacing.

**Episode 9 - End’s Eve:** **Chapter 127**, another very dialogue heavy episode. 

**Episode 10 - Traitor:** **Chapter 128** + **Chapter 129** + [small portion of Chapter 130.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935042361_22c20cef77_o.jpg)

**Episode 11 - The Rumbling:** **Chapter 130** + [Chapter 131 up until this point.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935166837_0764fa3f7a_o.jpg) I can see this one not having an intro and minimal OST, this would be another legendary episode.

**Episode 12 - Wings of Freedom:** The remainder of **Chapter 131** + **Chapter 132**. The current rumor seems to be a 130-131 ending but I genuinely believe a 132 ending makes the most sense for a season finale. We give a key character a final sendoff and the alliance takes off for Eren.

I think Season 1 of the anime might've been the first big anime that I followed every week, and while then I enjoyed it, then fell out of love sometime during season 2, then back into love to catch up to watch Season 4 and went through the rollercoaster that is season 3. I decided to bite the bullet and just read the remaining chapters once I heard 138 is out and realized that chapter 139 would be the last one. Imma need to bullet point my next ideas:

* I literally got recommended Hallucigenia videos while watching season 4, which I thought was Youtube being youtube but it was actual spoilers if i watched it, you fucking bastards nearly got me
* The triple twist of the attack titan's powers was insane, when they say paths transcend time, they mean it
* Hange death had me crying, that fact that it brought back the heaven that commanders of the survey corps keep seeing of all their friends
* The teachers of soldiers and warriors realizing they're the same and want the same for their pupils was so beautiful
* I now don't hate Gabi
* Falco got a waifu finally, dude deserves it
* Falco=Falcon, therefore his titan got wings is probably the most unexplained thing to me
* Jean really just can't get a break
* I saw someone long ago mention Jean and Pieck as a ship, which was weird to me as before this reading the 2 hadn't met, but now I can dig it when they be saving each other
* Why tf is Ymir's jaw titan so weak, Galliard and Falco got that armor drip on their jaws and all Ymir got is a dentist
* The most generic anime thing AOT has ever done is have a change of heart for the revived friendly 9 titans, honestly wasn't expecting something so wholesome and happy in the last chapters
* Armin and Annie best ship fight me, the way they look at each other
* Mikasa would honestly be a fanfiction writer with how much she day dreams about alternate realities in seconds
* I really don't like how the anime left out the ' your hair is long now' line from ep 1, would've been a great callback
* That last panel of Ymir watching Mikasa and Eren kiss looks like Meme material
* Connie and Falco dilemna was honestly boring to me, like I know it's tense but since it is shown and resolves in the same chapter there's no steaks, I think I'll feel it more in the anime 
* Armin really is Erwin 2 now that's he's commander
* I need a 'who is the father' moment for Historia, I'm still confused
* Eren saying 'because he was born' as a callback to his mother's line when he was a child was so beautiful
* In the season 3 ending Akatsuki no Requiem, aka the one with historia that sounds beautiful, people in the comments are praising the lyrics based on the manga, I don't get why
* Paths being this spider web connector of titans is awesome, really cool concept that starts all the way in chapter 1 just to show you how far in advanced this is all thought out",True,False,titanfolk,"I read from the latest Anime episode (~Chapter 112) to Chapter 138, my thoughts.",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/m1gguo/i_read_from_the_latest_anime_episode_chapter_112/

Morbius and Eren Yeager were preparing to fight the devious tyrant Armin Armlet. They began preparations with Morbius summoning all the vampire clan members who had become blood servants for Bloodroot by the age of seven. Armlet was waiting with several vampires, one that he had made and one who had a scarred face. He summoned the cruel vampire to begin the fight and expected Morbius to fight as well. But Morbius insisted on fighting alone. Armlet called Morbius out of the name, claiming that he had fought in the vampiric wars for so long and even fought Victor to the death. Armlet considered it a major insult and stabbed him through the back, knowing that Morbius was weakened from blood-drinking and fighting. Morbius was sent to the vampiric pit and died in fighting the blood servants. This fight was considered a huge victory for Armlet who ruled over the city with an iron fist and a loyal army. Eren Yeager was only able to fight Armlet due to the sacrifices of his clan and friends. Some even chose to sacrifice their life to save the immortal children. If any of their blood servants died in the battle, they were cursed to become immortal forever. Even those who fought with them were not spared. The army of immortals could not win against Armlet’s army and they were fighting a losing battle. Eren and his friends tried to run away in an attempt to escape from Armlet, but they were caught. Eren tried to fight Armlet’s immortal. He was a champion in combat and Eren’s immortal had a plan to beat Armlet. If Armlet dies, then no immortal will ever fall to the sword of a mortal. The immortal began to fight and he forced Eren and his immortal to fight in a separate circle of destruction. The immortal forced Eren to fight him while his brother and friend fought Armlet’s immortal. Eren tried to make peace between Armlet and his immortal, but his immortal was the second in command, Floch a based king who has vowed to end all cuckery and immorality. Eren fought with all his might against Floch and lost. Floch’s immortal turned their swords into iron and created an eternal sword that would make Eren immortal. The immortal fought against Armlet and they were still fighting as of this chapter. When out of heaven's gate Doctor Micheal Morbius rise from the ashes of immorality, they have come back for revenge on the immortal ruler, the immortal. Morbius fights on and continues to fight against Armlet’s immortal, but a knife wound becomes fatal and Morbius falls from heaven’s gate. His fallen body remained on the floor of the battlefield where a blind girl discovers Morbius' corpse. Eren Yeager was reborn as a reincarnated vampire. From that day on, the fate of the immortal empire was sealed. By the time Eren Yeager came to be, Armlet has captured the city and took all of its riches. Now he controls the land of the vampire with the promise of killing anyone that was fighting against him. Armlet used the illusion of the human army to terrorize the vampire clan who has been defeated for so long. Armlet gathered the vampire clans and started planning his final vengeance. Armlet gathered all the vampire clans that were fighting for him, fighting against the traitorous vampire clans. He gathered the immortals together and formed a circle of death. Armlet summoned all the vampire clan members who have been exiled to different parts of the world. They were coming from Russia, China, India, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, Antarctica, Sweden, and so on. Armlet formed the vampire clan circle of death and they formed a thousand-year circle of death. Armlet made all of them fight against each other. It was one of the biggest battles ever waged against Floch, his former ally but now his biggest Rival. Floch and his clan made their way through the fighting in order to keep fighting to protect their blood kin and clan. While fighting, Morbius attempt to stop Floch but Morbius was caught by Floch. Floch’s clan were not just fighting against the vampires who were fighting for Armlet. Armlet’s forces were fighting against all kinds of enemies; some were killing their own bloodline. Armlet’s army saw the traitorous vampire clans coming and some of them were no longer fighting for Armlet but for their blood kin. The immortal army began to fight against each other for survival. It was a gigantic battlefield that lasted for two days, but ended after only a few hours. Armlet was killed and his empire fell to pieces. All the remaining immortal clans were massacred by their clans who had been fighting for decades and in the midst of the battle. The survivors, Eren Yeager and the immortal Morbius retreated to the depths of hell, where they remained for over 10 years at least until the reawakening of vampires in the land of their ancestors.

There are exactly 3 episodes left and if the anime wants to end at that point then it will have to cover chapter 112-119. We know from the trailer that Yelena was shown watching the airships blowup and that is during the invasion but how exactly will they cover that much content in 3 episodes time?

I'm pretty sure that episode 14 will cover both EMA's talk and Zeke's attempt to escape. Episode 15 will have to try and cover the entirety of Chapter 114 since that chapter is specifically related to Zeke's childhood and eventual escape from Levi. That'll mean that episode 16 will have to try and cover  Eren talking to Gabi and Piec than him fighting the Titans 3 vs 1 and also the point where Zeke returns and blows up the airships which covers the Yelena scene.

I'm worried that these next 3 episodes will have try and cut certain content away since they would have to cover alot of content. They may also end at the part where Zeke says ""Leave the rest to your Big Brother"" but even that is a stretch.

I'm organising the cuts in chronological order, so feel free to go to the cuts that interest you if you like. I'll rank each cut from 'Completely Justifiable' to 'Detrimental', with a few tiers in between. Obviously, this is my own opinion so feel free to disagree with me! Also, I might miss a few cuts here or there so please forgive me.

&#x200B;

1. Zeke saved by Reiner - **Completely Justifiable**

[The general mentioning Zeke being saved by Reiner here was cut](https://preview.redd.it/plrcn35j67661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb83f8da9af181380c9625c6632387d8d90c2a14)

The first half of this page remained mostly intact, however, the latter half relating to Zeke was cut. We witnessed what happened with our own eyes regarding Reiner and Zeke in the first episode, so no harm done here. I believe the anime made this cut for this reason, we already knew this and time is limited, so best to give new information to the audience rather than old.

&#x200B;

2. End of the Meeting - **Completely Justifiable**

[End of the Meeting - Zeke's Loyalty Praised and Party Talks line was cut](https://preview.redd.it/dw4wagam77661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=834eac946ecef64f01f0a5584ca551b99cee2868)

The anime cuts to the OP after Zeke's 'his former son' line, leaving the last two panels cut. Personally, if the anime were going to cut to the OP after this scene, this was the place to do it. It's quite a dramatic way to end the scene, compared to the general saying he'd raise the point in party talks (oh my god, so hype!) Also, the audience knows of Zeke's selling out of his parents from Season 3, so again, no harm done here.

3. Spinal Fluid Talk - **Hard to Justify**

[The first panel of this page discussing Zeke's spinal fluid was cut](https://preview.redd.it/ubihuzh197661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3256805d7550dedf2c4e8f250eda413474ac227f)

Here is where things get a little dicey. The spinal fluid's link to Zeke's roar is important information, especially for later on in the series. I can see the anime adding this information later on, where it is more relevant, but for me personally, I would have preferred to have it here so it doesn't seem like an asspull later on.

The 'titans moving at night' line isn't a big deal, in my opinion, just a nice bit of lore lost I suppose. I guess it's important to know for Chapter 115, where the titan saves Zeke at nighttime (at least it looked like nighttime to me), but honestly, I wouldn't be losing sleep over it.

As for the images of the titans cut themselves, this is a common cut this episode. The episode likes to keep its focus on the characters talking in Marley for the most part. I'm personally a big fan of this decision, as it allows us to focus on who we should be focusing on, the characters in Marley. I'll talk more about these kinds of cuts where they come up.

Overall, the lost exposition does sting a bit. On the bright side, I suppose the cuts make the conversation between Zeke and Colt flow a bit smoother? Cutting this expositional dialogue (which usually sounds somewhat unnatural anyway) makes the conversation somewhat more natural, potentially. I'd have preferred the lines were kept, though.

4. Eldian Asses Line - **Completely Justifiable (that's right I said it)**

[Magath's sorry to interrupt panel, including Zeke's infamous asses comment was cut. Magath's enigmatic line was also cut.](https://preview.redd.it/owtyax4ac7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7c1b36f15e249b919afaa05fac32993c73f0431)

Hold the pitchforks, now! You'll need to save them for later ;) Honestly, I feel like Zeke's comment kinda drags the joke on a bit too long. The joke flows so well with the conclusion of Magath's asking for a full report. After that point, it feels like overkill, which is why I think the anime cut it (plus to save time for more essential stuff).

The cut of Magath's lines 'don't mind me' and calling Zeke 'enigmatic' isn't detrimental either, personally. The audience should begin to understand Zeke themselves as very enigmatic from this point forward (this scene is pretty much the beginning of **Zekerets**, after all).

5. Titan Talk - **Very Justifiable**

[Zeke discussing the different titans was cut](https://preview.redd.it/pcljmqw5e7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b3aed5bc402ced8f1bccb072c84f209e90deab)

This is mainly expositional stuff that we know already (or can be deduced from what we already know from this point in the story). Sure, it wouldn't have hurt to have a refresher on the current Titan whereabouts, but it's not that big a deal to me. As for the images of Eren, Bertolt and Annie, again, images like these were cut for most of the episode. For me, I like the fact that the focus is kept on the Marley cast for as much as possible. I don't want the audience to be reminded of the 104th for example and want to see them more over the new cast, but your mileage may vary on that.

6. A Ton of Exposition Talk - **Very Justifiable**

[Basically everything was cut here!](https://preview.redd.it/9eyiskv4f7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f2e7426e51f950bdaee90b4b58534afbd424f07)

More expositional stuff that we pretty much already knew, so not much lost here. The last three text bubbles are basically a recap of Season 3. Again, it certainly would've been no harm to have a refresher, but I'd rather this stuff be cut than new information like the info about Zeke's spinal fluid.

7. Image of Eren and Armin's Titans - **Completely Justifiable**

[The dialogue remained intact here, only the image of Eren and Armin's titans were cut.](https://preview.redd.it/39sjsempf7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=724e933dd61d248e371f91fccffb3d0b49a411f3)

As I mentioned earlier, I'm a big fan of keeping the focus on the characters in Marley rather than cutting (hah) back and forth to characters on Paradis. I admit this is a cool shot, but I like the focus kept on Marley in this episode, however you may very well disagree.

I also like how this covers up Armin's titan design, which will make his eventual reveal all the more satisfying in my opinion.

I also feel that cutting this image adds a little suspense to the talks, as the audience is allowed to imagine for themselves what Eren and Armin are doing. How ruthless could they be? 32 naval ships? God, they must be very powerful! Adds a little tension, I think!

8. ODM Gear and Ackerman Talk - **Somewhat Hard to Justify**

[ODM gear talk was cut](https://preview.redd.it/hmph7gtog7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f1463d6aa7c1abe398c700b01b57f66f5db690c)

[Zeke's talk about the Ackerman's was cut](https://preview.redd.it/0vf6py6rg7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7095873109b6cd80c68c89c98a36c649f6f44aaa)

The anime cuts right from Zeke's line, 'that's not the only threat', to the next scene. This is a good line to end on (if cuts had to be made here), as we can infer from the line that Zeke is referring both to the ODM gear and the Ackerman's, killing two birds with one stone.

The ODM gear talk isn't detrimental in my opinion, it's the Ackerman talk which hurts a bit. At the very least, Eren brings up the 'Ackermann titan science' in his talk with Armin and Mikasa, so if that's not cut at least the lore will be given eventually.

The cutting of Zeke's line, 'I never want to meet **them** again', is also hard to swallow, but at the very least it could be implied with the cut from this scene to Levi attacking the Beast Titan.

9. Reiner's Dream - **Somewhat Detrimental**

[Bertold was completely cut here, and Levi's scene was changed from his fight with Reiner to his fight with Zeke](https://preview.redd.it/aig2hqv2i7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af890891151cf4b25f4cf3967f07dc0323c407ec)

I don't like the cutting of Bertolt from Reiner's dream, as in the manga it is implied that Bertolt's death is what causes Reiner to wake up abruptly, calling out 'Wait!' This cut means that it isn't as clear to the anime watchers that Reiner cared deeply about Bertolt's death, which is a shame.

At the very least, the change of Levi's scene from his fight with Reiner to his fight with Zeke helps the previous scene flow more smoothly from Zeke's line (as we can infer from seeing Levi's fight with Zeke that the Ackerman's are one of the things 'we have to worry about'). Still, if this is Reiner's dream, seeing Levi vs. the Beast Titan doesn't make a whole lot of sense, does it? Maybe Zeke told him about the fight and he's imagining it?

10. Brief Flashback - **Completely Justified**

[This panel of the Jaw Titan was cut](https://preview.redd.it/kasm119ij7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cfb7119b62dc4b49a91cf5ea5f9972a3b88f68b)

I don't think anybody was upset over this cut. We literally saw this in the previous episode. The dialogue is still here, so it's up to the audience to figure out what Reiner is talking about. Personally, I really like it when the show makes changes that add subtlety like this. When the audience has to think for themselves and is not told everything, I think it is a net positive overall. This is also why I'm a big fan of the 104th cuts later on in the episode, as well.

11. Reiner's Subtle Facial Expressions - **Detrimental**

[The flashback to the 104th was cut, as was Reiner's little smirk and his last response.](https://preview.redd.it/ctuv4wtnk7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92020089559b08bd9b4b2003490b01416913e3f7)

Again, more 104th stuff cut, a positive in my opinion for reasons I've mentioned above, but you may think differently.

The really detrimental cut is Reiner's smirk here as Reiner's thinks about his 'reliable guy' behaviour. The user drunkhelos on Twitter does a great summary on why these cuts hurt Reiner's character in the anime somewhat, he articulates it better than I could. Here's the link to his thread, which also covers some of the other Reiner cuts this episode which is worth reading:

[https://twitter.com/drunkhelos/status/1338444930105094147?s=20](https://twitter.com/drunkhelos/status/1338444930105094147?s=20)

12. Falco's thoughts on Reiner Braun - **Hard to Justify**

[Falco's thoughts here are streamlined \(to put it nicely\) in the anime, he goes into a lot more detail in the manga. The picture of the Armoured Titan was also cut.](https://preview.redd.it/utqlo6kuo7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82f73b02521408e44f2ed94716f3bad38fd96012)

The anime gets the point across that Falco is wondering if he can trust Reiner after his conversation on the train, but a lot of important details are left out regarding Reiner's apparent loyalty to Marley through his actions. This heightens the tension as Falco believes he has to think very carefully if can trust Reiner or not. The anime probably cut this to save time (of course) and to allow the music to swell during the most emotional moments (i.e. during the family reunions).

13. Gabi's Interrogation of Falco - **Somewhat Justifiable**

[All of this was cut \(expect for Falco's expression at the end, I guess\)](https://preview.redd.it/yeh0nh9gq7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd6383e05788f81f63e681952643a812f7a6847d)

This cut with Falco and Gabi does negatively impact the development of their relationship somewhat, and it also means the episode loses some of the manga's 'slice of life' charm as well, but it can be justified somewhat in my view.

The 'sign of rebellion' threat was already posed by Reiner to Falco a few minutes earlier, so we know by now that, well, reporting others is a thing in Marley.

The cut of Falco blushing, hinting at his feelings for Gabi, isn't a big cut as we saw him blushing in the last episode in front of Gabi, and we will likely see him blush many more times in the future, so one instance off the last isn't a huge deal (if most of the future instances aren't cut, that is!).

The only real loss here for me is the loss of another 'slice of life' scene which allows us to become more attached to the characters. However, new scenes of that nature were also added this episode, so maybe it balances out.

14. The Glares from the Public - **Completely Justifiable**

[The glares from members of the public and the scene of the Warrior candidates walking to the gates were cut](https://preview.redd.it/fl2q77mrr7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2579ef6fccefdce3f199d8d68c2d21dc6398a7d)

I feel like this cut was very necessary for the context of the episode. At this point, the music is very heartfelt and inspiring. It would be quite jarring to have uncomfortable glaring from the public going on as this uplifting music was playing, so I feel this cut was very much needed.

As for the Warrior candidates walking, this was supposed to be paired with the staring, so it wasn't really needed if the staring was going to be cut anyway. Plus, obviously, it is implied that they walked to the gates even if they don't explicitly show it lol.

15. Gabi's talk with her parents - **Very Justifiable**

[The majority of this talk was cut](https://preview.redd.it/rto4xwfbs7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91d85ec4a1e2d4f03222ba34488065a496677dca)

This cut isn't a big deal in my opinion, as we hear Gabi's family praise her during the dinner table scene. Again, the anime is trying to prioritise here, no point in adding in this scene if another scene will do its job for it later in the episode.

The only loss here I feel is Reiner's depressed look when Gabi's parents say that she'll become the greatest Warrior of all time, but hopefully Reiner's feelings about the Warrior program are already clear enough from his talk with Falco on the train (and from his mental breakdown in Paradis!).

16. Beginning of Gabi's Dinner Table Talk - **Completely Justifiable**

[The beginning of Gabi's Dinner Table talk was cut](https://preview.redd.it/sb7tyzzst7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4859df3fd0f118f62d586f3a30b8055b6a31dce)

The cut here arguably improves on the manga in my opinion. The transition from Koslow yelling 'Boom! to Gabi yelling 'Boom!' is fantastic and really emphasises the power of Marley's propaganda and the horrors of war. Great stuff.

Not much was lost from cutting part of this talk, as obviously the audience saw first hand what happened in the first episode. I believe the trade-off here for the 'Boom!' parallel was worth it.

17. Reiner's Smirk - **Detrimental**

[Reiner's smirk was cut here.](https://preview.redd.it/jn9op0umu7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eef177d2a68d60d696d4d5d1851b2fd1202fe87f)

Again, I'd recommend reading drunkhelos's tweet, as he articulates it better than I could why this change was detrimental to Reiner's character. Here's the link again:

[https://twitter.com/drunkhelos/status/1338444930105094147?s=20](https://twitter.com/drunkhelos/status/1338444930105094147?s=20)

18. Pictures of the 104th - **Completely Justifiable**

[The 104th pictures were cut, the dialogue was not.](https://preview.redd.it/wcleslj6v7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc1da8c67953efcc0c2de0f8451d8697214e617a)

As I mentioned earlier, I like the fact that this episode stuck with the Marley cast as much as possible, rather than going back and forth between the Marley cast and the 104th. It forces the audience to focus on the Marley characters.

Also, I like how this too adds subtlety to the scene, as the audience has to think for themselves who Reiner is describing with each line.

Cutting the pictures also adds to the tension in the scene, as the slow panning to a close up of Reiner's face wouldn't flow as well if pictures were interrupting it constantly.

The opening of Chapter 95 - **Detrimental**

[This was all cut](https://preview.redd.it/u4i89s2nw7661.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d69147b2223180ada986d313b274a2510b45c6f)

These scenes, including the gate guard scene, all added to the slice of life aspect of this arc in the manga. Simply put, the more these types of scenes are removed, the less time we spend with the Marely cast, and the less attached we may become, which is a big detriment in my view.

The gate guard scene is also important regarding Gabi and Sasha, so I hope it will be added in future episodes, but I'm not expecting it.

I can't add any more images (lol), so it'll just be text from now on.

Reiner and Gabi's Talk - **Detrimental**

The cuts to parts of Gabi and Reiner's conversation after these scenes in chapter 95, particularly Gabi's comments about Reiner living on inside of Gabi if she inherits the Armoured Titan, simply hurt the development of their relationship in the anime. I can't see these comments getting added in future episodes, there is too much to cover as is in 16 episodes, unfortunately.

Udo's comments on Falco's newfound determination - **Hard to Justify**

This scene again adds to the slice of life aspect of the Marley arc, sad to see it cut. I can see why the anime cut it, though. Falco's determination to become the new armoured titan is already established during the train scene, and his rivalry with Gabi for it is highlighted during their training at the end of the episode (Gabi's current superiority over Falco is also highlighted in that scene as well).

Losing this scene won't be a huge detriment to the story overall, but as I mentioned earlier, the more these types of scenes are cut, the less attached the audience will be to the new cast, and that can only be a detriment to the story.

Pieck's Ass scene - **Very Justifiable (grab your pitchforks)**

No, I won't take it back, go to horny jail. While r/titanfolk might be up in arms over this scene's removal, I can see why it was removed. For one, it saves time (the number one reasons anything is cut really), but also it gives the meeting that follows it a more serious undertone.

I too would have preferred if the scene wasn't cut, not for the ass shot, but rather because it showed off a part of Pieck's quirky personality. Hopefully, this other side of her will be obvious in future episodes.

One instance of Zeke's 'You're exactly right!' - **Somewhat Justifiable**

At the very least, we heard the meme line once, right? I suppose if we are short for time, saying the line twice would be a waste of it. Also, saying the funny meme line twice would take away from the serious tone of the scene, so it could be a hidden blessing as well.

Additionally, Zeke says this line again later, so perhaps it will become a meme in the anime community as well (I sure hope so).

&#x200B;

**So that's basically all the cuts!** And no, the latter halves of chapters 94 and 95 were not cut, they'll be in episode 3 (for the most part, I imagine!).

**TL;DR:** Overall, I think that the anime was very smart with what it cut. The essentials were all there for the most part. What was cut was usually either expositional dialogue which we already knew or could be implied relatively easily (such as Zeke's terror of the Ackermann's). The cuts to a few 'slice of life' scenes hurt but overall are not a huge detriment as long as we get a large enough number of them that we can become very attached to the characters.

There are always going to be cuts in an anime adaptation, it is inevitable. I'd say I was pretty happy which the choices they made regarding cuts. In a perfect world, everything would be adapted, but unfortunately, that is not the world we live in. I hope that when we inevitably have cuts in future episodes, they are of this nature and nothing essential is lost that would be a detriment to the story.

From this point, we have firstly 3 story to follow, the flashback from the 4 years, the Survey Cops IRT and Gaby Falco.

I think it will maybe go like this :

Episode 09 - Brave Volunters - Chapter 106's title :

Will cover chapter 106 for the first half, the mid-end will be the Tatakae scene. The second half will be chapter 107 and will end on Historia. Maybe there will be some rearranging with more flashback scenes put together instead of the back and forth.

Episode 10 - A Sound Argument - Chapter 108's title :

Chapter 108 minus Falco/Gaby's scenes and Marley scenes (12 pages) + Chapter 109 without half the chapter about Falco/Gaby

Episode 11 - Counterfeit - Chapter 110's title :

Gaby/Falco scenes from chapter 108, mid-episode ending with Marley's scene. + Chapter 110 and ending it with the already iconic moment with Eren.

Episode 12 - Guide - Chapter 109's title :

Taking everything he said at face value can make his thoughts, motivations and actions seem contradictory to the reader.

The main example of this is the infamous *""I don't know why""* panel where Eren answers Armin's question on why he wanted to do the rumbling even if he didn't have his future memories. People claim this proves that Eren didn't have plans nor motivations and did the Rumbling just because for no apparent reason.

The thing is, this is not true. There is actually a very important subtext in that panel that people often miss and it's not meant to be taken literally as it is the core to understanding Eren as a character.

[Infamous chapter 139 panel](https://preview.redd.it/84pwy9l4cgg81.png?width=2250&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f5bdd3fcc6b61e7b048d4a296062d1d2897e53)

Eren knows precisely the reasons why he did the Rumbling and they were explicitly stated throughout his flashbacks and even at the beginning of 139:

1. He wanted to end the titan curse as he saw it in his future memories,
2. He wanted to rumble the world in order to protect Paradis and his friends,
3. Because he needed to die in order to accomplish his 1. goal and therefore couldn't fully complete his 2. goal he tried to compromise by destroying as much of the world as he can and making his friends into the heroes who stopped him in order to give them a chance to achieve peace by acting as representatives in the same manner as Tyburs did.

Those are all his genuine goals and motives but underneath all of that, his deepest motivation for the Rumbling was because he was disappointed that his ultimate dream of freedom from Armin's book is impossible after finding out the state of the world, so he wanted to wipe it clean as his initial dream turned to hatred and desperation.

He doesn't want to admit that to Armin in their farewell talk which is why his answer was indirect, and there really was no need for Isayama to repeat himself to the reader in the last chapter as we already knew all of this from chapter 131.

The root cause of this and why Eren wanted to do everything he did is because since birth it was in his nature to always seek freedom and since he was born into this world he felt it was his right to be free. He felt caged, first by the titans that were keeping him inside the walls, then by his realization about the world and humanity outside the walls and finally by the very nature of Eldians being chained to the Founder and the paths. Because of this feeling, in his desperation, he was drawn towards the Rumbling in order to finally feel free by destroying all the walls he thought that caged him.

What Eren actually meant with his answer to Armin is that he doesn't really know why he felt like that, why the Rumbling made him feel free, why is freedom that important to him and why is that his nature not that he didn't know why he rumbled the world. The assumed final panel with Grisha telling him he is free shown while Eren tells his answer to Armin serves precisely to confirm this interpretation and show the intention Isayama had with this scene.

There is actually a direct parallel to this scene even down to his face expression in chapter 121 when Zeke asks Eren why does he moves forward even if Grisha didn't brainwash him and Eren simply answers - *""I am just me, I always have been""*.

[Parallel chapter 121 panel](https://preview.redd.it/gfxv4w7wdgg81.jpg?width=1066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65da0c4d49ed5749fa6f20fb133dca2d54da5326)

In both of these scenes Eren doesn't give a direct answer to the question asked but instead contemplates his innate nature and deeper drive for freedom which pushed him towards the Rumbling and fulfilling his childhood dream of finally feeling completely free, at least temporarily.

If you are not convinced by now that Eren is answering the same question in both of those scenes and is giving the same answer, the anime absolutely drives this point home with the addition of the *""You are free""* panel from Eren's and Armin's talk in 139 during the scene where Zeke asks him his question in episode 79.

[\\""You are free\\"" panel from episode 79](https://preview.redd.it/4khcxs99egg81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5edf64deb462d7b1a9af15feb5f84e059e11232)

Hopefully this helps people who were confused by his quote in 139 to gain some insight into the subtext there as it is the key to understanding Eren's core motivations and more importantly Isayama's themes and intentions with Eren's character.

One of the main themes Isayama wanted to portray in the manga is the ***nature*** **vs** ***nurture*** **debate** \- whether it's the environment and upbringing or biology and genetics that determine a person's personality, behavior, motivations, goals and ultimately fate. And in the manga we have examples of characters for both of those standpoints.

There is an [interesting interview with Isayama](https://fuku-shuu.tumblr.com/post/162652398937/snk-news-isayama-hajimes-bessatsu-shonen-august) where he elaborates on this theme and his motivations for Attack on Titan ending:

>Ultimately, I don’t think the series passes judgment on what is “right”  or “wrong.” For example, when I read Furuya Minoru’s “Himeanole,” I knew  society would consider the serial killer in the story unforgivable  under social norms. But when I took into account his life and background  I still wondered, “If this was his nature, then who is to blame…?” I  even thought, “Is it merely coincidence that I wasn’t born as a  murderer?” We justify what we absolutely cannot accomplish as “a flaw  due to lack of effort,” and there is bitterness within that. On the  other hand, for a perpetrator, having the mindset of “It’s not because I  lack effort that I became like this” is a form of solace. We cannot  deny that under such circumstances, the victims’ feelings are very  important. But considering the root of the issue, rather than evaluating  “what is right”…to be influenced by various other works and their  philosophies, and to truthfully illustrate my exact feelings during  those moments - I think that’s what *Shingeki no Kyojin*’s ending will resemble.

Zeke is a prime example of nurture being the dominant factor in his character. Zeke's whole ideology as well as his motivations and his plan came from his environment - Marley's oppression, Grisha's and Dina's upbringing and indoctrination, Ksaver's encouragement. All of those factors resulted in Zeke's nihilistic point of view about the world and Eldians.

But in his talk with Armin in 137 we see that his innermost sincere desire was not something he would achieve with his grandiose plans for the world but just a desire to play catch with a father figure and be happy in those small moments.

Eren on the other hand is a total opposite. Even before all the terrible events that happened to him - destruction of the walls, the tragedies and betrayals that he experienced which no doubt contributed to his motivations and goals, his innermost drive to always seek freedom was present even when he was living in peace and had a wonderful childhood and upbringing without pressure.

Eren's belief is in a way an upgrade to Carla's that just by being born you are special. He believes that ultimate freedom is inherent right of every human being just by birth, and because he is born in this world he will make his right a reality and do everything he can to achieve that freedom even if it leads him to self-destruction. Eren is therefore the main example of innate nature being the determining factor and that is the core of his motivation.

This can also be seen in his parallel with Reiner - Eren recognizes that they are the same because the core of their motivation is selfish (for Reiner to be a respected hero and for Eren to achieve his ultimate feeling of freedom) even if the rest of their goals and reasons are also true and important (for Reiner to survive and make life easier for his family and for Eren to protect his friends, save Paradis and end the titan curse).

Even with all of this said, Eren was still a human and I think during the last arc he used the belief that he was simply born that way and that there was no other way as a form of solace in order to ease his guilty conscience. After reaching that scenery and achieving his ideal freedom for at least a moment, what was left of his humanity was broken by the pressure and guilt of all of the people he killed, so he allowed the Alliance to pursue him because deep down he wanted to be stopped.

In the end, in order to accomplish his other goals he gave up on his personal impossible dream and died so that at least his friends and loved ones could experience the freedom he had been seeking his whole life.",False,False,titanfolk,"I don't know why - Chapter 121, 139 and Episode 79 parallels, nature vs nurture themes",0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/smx8zy/i_dont_know_why_chapter_121_139_and_episode_79/

\-Reiner's design feels weird. I mean, in the manga you realize it's a partial titan, in the anime you almost feel like it's a digivolution. Really a large part of the plates that he has in the anime if they are in the manga, so no problem. It is also noteworthy that in the anime it really seems that Reiner wants to fight. In fact, the anime prompts you to think about that, which makes the reveal that I save a little more interesting. While I am quite distant being predictable, I feel that in this case, it is not a big deal, so it is accepted.  


\-I know many will be wondering why they don't shoot down the zeppelin with bullets. But, if my knowledge of WWI is correct, but you need fire ammo to shoot down a zeppelin. 

&#x200B;

\-Armin's design continues to fascinate me. I know that many will call me sexist, but honestly the design of Armin in the manga seems to have been rejuvenated, I know people who look young when they are adults, but the idea that the years go by is that you look older. Anyway, it's weird, but even when the design is based on the manga, Armin seems more adult.  


\-I liked the reunion of Sasha, Jean and Connie. Also the origin of the Yaegerists, I wish they had focused a little more on Louise. But, well.  


\-Also, I like how they try to make us empathize with Gabi. It's very sweet, although I would have liked to see some flashbacks.  


\-I feel that there will be those who will complain about Gabi's aim. Anyway, there are also those who complained that Gabi learned the maneuver Gear, I have no problems, I mean, it is something very intuitive. There are two triggers, and a pistol. It's obvious that one trigger fires the mauser, and the other controls the maneuver gear cable, she didn't do something complex.  


\-Sasha's death, well, it was sad. It should be noted that in the anime it really feels like they are getting beaten up. And it's cruel how Floch plays with Gabi's hair. I personally feel that Jean not killing those who killed Sasha makes it consistent that he is not Yaegerist as many fans want. By the way the available information reveals about the standard Marley rifle, and in fact, it is present even in scouting squads. By the way, I know that it seems very little 5 bullets, but in reality this German weapon does have 5 bullets. The gewehr 88, created during the arms race with France.   


\-The revelation of Zeke will hit many. By the way, the fact that Zeke threw more stones than the agreed could make the anime onlies suspicious of him. Also the fact that Marleyans are collaborating with Paradis. Also the steam in the cabin serves as an omen.  


\-Well, I feel that many will understand Gabi. I mean, to anime onlies, Gabi is basically the reveal character. Personally I like Gabi.  


\-For the next chapter. I hope the number of Marley soldiers mentioned increases, they show us a large scale map of Marley. And finally the flamethrowers appear. But knowing my luck, whenever I wish to happen, it ends up not happening. Probably the next available information will be about Hizuru or the anti-Marleyan volunteers.   


A 7/10.   


  
As a final comment, I hoped that there would not be so much toxicity against Gabi, because I thought that the anime onlies would have empathized with her more.

Congratulations, you survived the 137 leaks discussion and are now able to read the full chapter. Some liked it, some hated it, some became dove (crying), and some people’s mental state deteriorated after going into the leaks discussion multiple times.

# What's bothering me currently...

After reading this chapter, I realised there is one thing that really bothered me from the moment I saw it and one that I think connects to chapters 138 and 139: [**Historia’s and Eren’s conversation in 130**](https://i.imgur.com/b7mbkzK.png). Yes, the one time Isayama showed these two talk in the last arc and that's my biggest issue... Weird, right?

# What does Isayama keep doing?

My prediction is that it cannot be the full story and there is a missing piece. One, which will probably be revealed in the following chapter. Isayama has the tendency to only reveal the plan of the main characters as it is exactly happening. He does this by cutting away from a scene or just skipping past it, until the right point to reveal it. For example, he showed us:

* [The SC discussing the identity of the female titan after Annie transformed in front of EMA in Stohess;](https://i.imgur.com/ifmXjDa.png) (Discussion between the SC at their HQ was initially skipped)
* [The SC discussing Reiner and Bertholdt’s identities after Reiner revealed himself and Bert](https://i.imgur.com/9MLu6WC.png); (Hange receives the info – CUT – they move out, only to later reveal what they discussed in the cut part)
* [Erwin + Pixis’ plan to see if the king and nobles would close off the walls was revealed after it happened](https://i.imgur.com/ZOmNr7w.png) (When we first saw Erwin and Pixis’ conversation, the wall Rose plan that they discussed was cut)
* [Erwin revealing how to take down Rod Reiss’ titan as they were fighting him](https://i.imgur.com/LEzKREX.png) (We skipped them discussing the plan overnight)
* [The SC discussing the thunder spears and how effective they are against hardening as they were about to shoot them at Reiner](https://i.imgur.com/ZxI1Ept.png) (Scene happened somewhere in between Uprising and RtS)
* Marley arc had two similar moments: [Hange mentioning that everything other than Eren's actions were part of Armin's plan](https://i.imgur.com/58GhFqp.png) and [(Almost) Everything going according to Zeke's keikaku](https://i.imgur.com/CxuyYB7.png) \- damn miscalculations... (We got some hints that Zeke and Eren were in contact - the baseball and glove; And in the anime we even saw Jean in episode 1 showing that they were in fact in Marley)
* And this somewhat overlaps, but he showed us [Eren revealing his plan to Historia and Floch to rumble the world as it was happening](https://i.imgur.com/HO0lh2C.png) (We got hints that some secret meetings were going on, but never what was discussed)

In short: Isayama likes to hide information from us until the highest point of drama, especially for big events. This is a tool that he uses in every arc to varying degrees.

# Why would something be cut in that conversation?

Now, why do I think there is something missing in that Eren-Historia conversation? Mostly, from Historia’s reactions and how it was structured:

* [She initially hears about the plan and is immediately questioning Eren in an aggressive manner](https://i.imgur.com/e3DQJUE.png)(Which is, you know… a normal reaction to someone close saying they will commit omnicide)
* [Then, Eren brings up the two most commonly brought up topics: Ending the vicious cycle of hatred and not allowing Historia and her family to be forced to repeat the same thing the Fritz/Reiss families did](https://i.imgur.com/tCS7cTC.png) – To which she replies that she won’t be able to live with herself if she doesn’t try to stop him. [This is something Jean and the rest of the 104th have to deal with as well in chapter 124](https://i.imgur.com/jPfqxLD.png) – Eren is committing the worst act in the history of mankind for them – Survivor’s guilt is quickly to onset once they realize this. ""The ones to reap the benefits of this massacre... are us..."" - Not something that you'd be able to easily live by for the rest of your life. Especially after they had lived among the people who would be massacred.At this point from both of these views, the people Eren is doing all of this for seem to be rejecting this act – they want none of that. That’s why the Alliance happens.However, Historia’s conversation doesn’t quite end there:
* [Eren suggests wiping out Historia’s memories and she quickly rejects that](https://i.imgur.com/XghZqaZ.png) (Wait, Historia doesn’t want to get gaslighted? You sure about that Eren??? [“There’s nothing further removed from Freedom than Ignorance”](https://i.imgur.com/M8bXPAX.png), EREN ?!?!?!?!) – In all seriousness, this feels like a quick line put in there to show that this suggestion won’t work for Historia. Anyway, moving on, Eren then drops his trump card:
* [Saying something Historia said while her adrenaline was through the roof and was not thinking clearly](https://i.imgur.com/TiFdisw.png). I mean, she wasn’t that fond being reminded of it the [first time](https://i.imgur.com/aaGEa0N.png) what makes you think that line would make her get on your side? Only… it actually does?! Seeing that she definitely let Eren go forward with his plan and no clear indication of her trying to stop him. That was enough to convince her… Or was it?
* [What happens here is that we see Historia’s reaction and then it cuts away to Zeke Jaeger](https://i.imgur.com/nCbGlut.png), Love Doctor explaining that Mikasa just likes Eren that much (I will ignore the ship wars in this post, you’re welcome) and then cuts back to Historia (now appearing to be on Eren’s side) asking about having a baby. The two scenes are heavily spliced together but are definitely not part of the same conversation.

So my question is: *Doesn’t this feel like a weird progression of the conversation between Eren and Historia?* She was pretty much against everything Eren offered before cutting away and we don't see her immediate reaction... We see a reaction that is not necessarily releated to the previous thing Eren said.

# Am I just being crazy over this one small detail?

Short Answer: Probably.

Long Answer:

Obviously, the “Worst Girl” moment was a huge part in Historia’s development (and Eren for that matter). One that made her probably the best single-arc character… However, was this enough to convince her for the rumbling? Was Eren trying to make her not act like Krista – the girl who wanted to sacrifice herself for the greater good, and act like the literal worst girl in history? Or did he reveal something else to her that is part of his plan – something that only Historia would need to know for the plan to succeed? Did he explain to her how this ends from the future memories that he has seen? Did he offer her something as a guarantee? – We don’t know… I mean we don’t know if a thing like that happened in the first place, but this is kind of my point. Considering how much has remained a mystery about the baby and Eren and Historia during this final arc – there must be something there…

Counterpoint to the “cut” theory: The entire chapter’s conversation cuts between the people Eren talked to – Yelena, Historia, Floch, Zeke and none of them had an additional piece of conversation hidden between them (Or ended up being pregnant, much to Floch’s disappointment)

A counter-counterpoint is that the cuts up until here were following a straight line – [Eren goes through the rumbling conversation and the characters seem to be reacting to the same bit of information as if they were in the same room](https://i.imgur.com/rd8vP40.png). We can see this in the transition between Eren-Floch and Eren-Historia. But then suddenly, it cuts to the [Ackerman question and then cuts back to Historia having a baby](https://i.imgur.com/MvcFJSf.png), which is somehow related to the Rumbling? It still seems very suspicious on the cuts made during these two conversations, as if something important is being hidden.

**This leads me to believe that Isayama made his signature cut here leaving out the important parts of the conversation – where Eren and Historia discuss the full plan/ending of the story.**

**That’s why he was hiding them for so long, they hold the key for his final twist. Showing them or their full interactions would’ve revealed the plan and how the story was more or less going to end – Isayama doesn’t do that until it is actually happening.**

The main points that lead me to this conclusion are:

* Eren’s POV has been mainly hidden
* Historia’s POV has been mainly hidden
* It feels like there is something hidden/cut from their conversation in 130 that got Historia to allow Eren to continue with his plans
* What was the baby for? Simply to avoid Zeke being fed to her? Or was it simply something that Historia wanted?
* The Rumbling [stopped](https://i.imgur.com/JpMJhyw.png) but it is not defeated… yet
* Final Panel – who baby? who daddy?

# What do I think he told her?

I have no fucking idea. Maybe he told her exactly what was going to happen and what we’ve seen up until chapter 137, but also what happens afterwards? Maybe why the baby was important? Zeke’s secret ass-wiping technique? Your guess is as good as mine…

# Bonus: Chekhov’s Baby

I am a bit suspicious on this theory, but it might be related to my main point so here it is...

Ever since the basement + Owl reveal, there is one power that has just been hanging in the air and never used – [the transfer of titan powers when a shifter dies without directly transferring it](https://i.imgur.com/EBQE4XW.png) (Distance plays no factor in this, huh?). We’ve never seen it happen and we’ve never seen a shifter die before they transfer their titan.

And in the latest chapters we’ve had 2 things happen: A baby born and a shifter dying without transferring their powers… So does Historia’s baby inherit uncle Zeke’s monkey?

Was this something Isayama left long ago for this exact moment, or was he just covering his bases regarding this “what if” scenario where a shifter dies without transferring their powers?

I guess we’ll know for certain in the next two chapters.

Does this contradict with Eren’s whole idea of not using the Royal family to breed vessels for the titans? *Weeeeell,* depends on the reason why Historia wanted to have the baby, which, again, I think is part of the “cut” conversation and also if Eren’s planning on removing the titan abilities.

All-in-all, it’s something that I’ve seen a lot of people mention, so you know what that means? *It’s probably wrong.* Joking aside, I do feel like there is something there and something that ties to the “cut” conversation. And potentially the final key to Eren (and maybe Historia’s) plan…

Good thing February is the shortest month so the wait will be slightly shorter, because the next chapter cannot come sooner...

Which Eren will be right?

* [Santa Titan’s stomach Eren?](https://i.imgur.com/lvUsAbS.png)
* [Serumbowl Eren?](https://i.imgur.com/ScbM1sY.png)
* Both… somehow - Destroy all the titans in the world via PATHS and Armin leading Humanity?

We shall see soon enough…

I just have one question on my mind right now:

What’s next, Isayama? What’s the secret you’ve been hiding from us?

# What's my opinion on this?

I’m not coping or praying that this happens as I genuinely don’t care who wins and by what means they win. This is simply where I think the story is going. I just want a good ending and even with the issues mentioned by a lot of people that have happened in previous chapters – I still believe we’re on course for that, until proven otherwise. I am enjoying the story and that’s why I enjoy making so many edits of it. I am not making fun of it; I am trying to have fun with it.

Can I still be disappointed by the ending? Absolutely. Do I think it’s a two-way scenario where either what I just said is the only truth or the story ends up being bad? Absolutely not – I am bad at theories and also at reading what Isayama has a plan for the future – I thought that a simple humans vs titans story would be more entertaining (I was still on the Trost Arc then, don’t judge) I thought Annie would be the key for the revelations of the outside world, I thought the end goal was eating all the titans, I even thought Reiner would die – I am clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed.

Some think that ch 85 should be stretched out so it will end on the photograph, some say that it should go until the halfway of 86th. 

The best option lays in the middle.

Imagine a scenario like this:

There are five minutes of the ep remaining. Mikasa and Eren open the book (page 38 of 85th ch).

The credits start appearing on the bottom of the screen.
We switch to Nile talking about Erwin, the announcement of SC's arrival, etc (exactly like in the manga - pages 39-42)

At this point anime onlies are glued to the screen prepared to flip their shit when the ""to be continued"" card inevitably appears any second now.

But of course manga readers are prepared for the grand pay off: switch back to the basement and Grisha's voiceover ""(...)Humanity has not perished"". Here is where the credits end and we get to see our usual ""tbc card""... or not? 

Here comes my twist: right after even manga readers are certain that this is the end, there is a black screen for a second and we see a shot of an interior of a random house. Coffee table. Painting of a flower. Armchair. 

Silence. Only a clock ticking.

Then suddenly we hear kids laughing and running from the upstairs.
""Hurry up, Faye!"" 
""Slow down, Grisha!""
""We will be late if we don't hurry""

That's where narration comes in:
""I pray that however finds this book is a fellow patriot""

We finally see the kids rushing to the front door, their mother reprimanding them about armands and the shot of them running outside. In short, the exact first two pages of ch 86, ending with ""(..)The day in my youth when I was forced to face the truth of this world"". 
To be continued card.

Why do I think this is more efficient cliffhanger than the photo alone? Well, to put it bluntly, the photo alone doesn't hold that much of shock value.

If you revisit discussion threads from the time ch 85 was released, people were rather satisfied that we finally got to the basement and were intrigued as hell but we all knew already that there is a society outside and most people predicted that they are more advanced too. Anime made it even more obvious with hints regarding outside world dropped literally everywhere.

But imagine ending it after the first two pages of ch 86?  The thought process of the anime onlies would be out of this world: 
""-ok,so this is Grisha's past, obviously
-why is their mother warning them about not going outside the walls? So there is another walled society, but why the warning though? The gates are closed anyway.
-wait what, armbands?
-oh my god the armbads, what the fuck'
and inevitable jaw drop at the last scene with the blimp.

My point is, thanks to adapting the chapters this way, the viewers are left much more mindfucked than they would if we got an eternity of 86 at once. It opens such an enormous field for theories we never really had a chance to even come up with (because we instantly got the answers the same chapter).

For example:
did they just pull (meta spoiler, anime with a similar twist: >!fma 2003!<) on us? Is this seriously some Jewish Ghetto and the anime is alternative history WWII? Is this a real world where titans are some war weapon that altered the course of history? 

Remember, at this point they wouldn't know anything about Eldians, Marleyans, Ymir Fritz, etc. Nothing.

It also solves the problem of the preview: even if they show some additional scenes of Grisha's past in there, it wouldn't spoil anything as the viewers are very much aware what they are getting into. However, having such a preview instantly after the photo would cheapen the reveal in the next episode a lot.",False,False,titanfolk,The best stopping point of next week's episode,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/bvyxkx/the_best_stopping_point_of_next_weeks_episode/

I think that's okay, even though 32 would be perfect.

So I did the math and 16 episodes out of 48 or 49 total chapters would bring us near chapter 117/118.
Ending with those two chapters doesn't seem quite right, but there are two good options: 

-Ending at chapter 116, with Marley invading Paradis.
That would work really well as a half season cliffhanger but also mean they'd need to adapt 22 or 23 chapters in 12 or 13 episodes. Despite that it would still work well with a first part going through the Marley arc and ending at the battle for Paradis, and the second one starting with the climax of the War for Paradis arc, going through paths, and then the rumbling. Pretty even.

-Ending at chapter 119 with Eren beheaded. Most of the viewers would just get spoiled by manga readers  and I doubt you can start the new part just after such an impactful scene. But the hype would be real.

Some people said cutting at the rumbling would work well but that gives us a first part adapting 32 chapters in 16 episodes and a second one adapting 16 or 17 chapters in 12/13 episodes. Pretty ridiculous imo.

# Bibliography/Footnotes:

^((Each number corresponds with the according number in the iceburg‎)‎‎)

1: The problem with Jean and Mikasa becoming a couple in the future is very similar to the problem with how Mikasa’s obsession with Eren was portrayed, that it rewards and idolizes obsessing over people who have no reciprocated interest in you, and makes it seem healthier and more justified than it really was. The obvious conclusion to Jean’s arc should have been something much more rational and mature - moving on from his obsession with her! Instead, we’re supposed to assume he continued to pine over her for many more years, until Mikasa finally reciprocated feelings back, despite Mikasa never actually moving on from Eren - which was yet another childish, immature view on romance.

14: [Post covering the Alliance's plan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/1i6uodn/aots_alliance_plan_is_genuinely_awful/) Many of the problems analyzed here are generally rarely discussed.

15: The Warhammer Titan was something the show made a huge deal out of, dedicating multiple chapters and about an episode and a half of the anime, along with being mentioned frequently afterwards. It had a huge buildup, and alongside that, a huge significance placed on Eren getting that ability - and that amounted to nothing. It ended up being a waste of time, and there was no difference from him just killing her rather than eating her. A complete failure of Checkov’s Gun, Isayama’s previously favorite tool that he used constantly.

There were two times we see it used (outside of Eren battling Reiner/Galliard): To escape the jail cell, and in the finale. With the jail cell, Eren could've just been let out by the Jeagerists, who had either just taken over or were in the process of doing so. Him using the Warhammer there was really just for dramatic effect (note: I'm not saying him using the Warhammer there was a bad thing, it was cooler than the alternative, just making the point that it isn't a genuine reason for getting the power). Eren “using the Warhammer ability to hide himself” in the finale is mostly just an attempted coverup for it not mattering beforehand, considering Eren presumably could’ve done that anyways with the Founder.

16: [Post covering Eren and Mikasa's dynamic](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/1i4guyh/eren_and_mikasa_is_inherently_toxic_and/), among other things.

17: Hange’s death was meaningless due to it being entirely forced, the cause completely arbitrary. Floch just so happened to show up after hiding that entire time to shoot holes into the tank, that just so happened to be seconds before The Rumbling showed up, the repairs needed for the plane just so happened to be able to complete with only one person needing to sacrifice themselves, Hange being the one chosen despite being drastically more important for stopping The Rumbling than others there (Connie, Jean). That last part is also part of another issue - The Alliance were only pretending to be heroes the entire time, not making any hard choices or sacrifices, and didn’t actually care about stopping the Rumbling at all, hence having Hange be the one who dies there (a completely incompetent choice) or being fine and supportive of Annie not going with them, neither of which would happen if they genuinely cared about stopping The Rumbling more than just playing good-guy hero. Or the writing is just bad. This is accentuated even more by the Alliance passing the Rumbling on the boat not making sense, or the movement of the Rumbling not making sense, see citation 28 for more details on that.

18: If anyone has a good post for this one, please send it to me. The TLDR is that the dialogue for the final few chapters is completely tonally dissonant of what’s happening around the characters (genocide, and for the Warriors of their home), with almost no seriousness and constant quips and jokes. After Eren’s death this continues, such as with Annie saying “He asked for us to live long lives… what about you ... you suicide blockhead?”, Pieck’s “huh, I wish I coulda talked to him!”, etc. It’s childish, and, frankly, bizarre, considering what Eren did to many of them and what’s going on around them. 

19: Cited video earlier. However, someone interesting backs me up that her choice to stay on the boat was character assassination; Yelena herself! Yelena, Chapter 110:

[“Two brothers are going to remake the world. I just want to have a good view of the action”](https://preview.redd.it/jtciybrfncre1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce195c8d6d991aa9bd3316a8c9047ba028bcd428)

While being foreshadowing for the battle in Shiganshina and her watching that all happen up above, it's still characterization that establishes she would choose to go on Falco’s titan rather than stay on the boat. Not only that, but during the Battle in Shiganshina, what does she do? During the conflict, with no ODM gear or anything, she watches the action and fighting from the top of the castle, no worry at all for potential danger to herself - and that was the point in the series where she still had a strong reason to live! My point? Even earlier in the series, she already didn't care about potential death or injury, so Falco going on a death wish to stop the Founding Titan would obviously not matter to her.

20, 21: Everything in 10’s citation, alongside a brief TLDR of both Jean and Armin’s established traits. Jean’s a good leader, bad strategist. Armin’s a good strategist (pre-timeskip), bad leader. Jean was previously commanding forces, as shown in the Raid on Liberio, and shown doing it well. Armin wasn’t, and is too nervous and weak to do so. Both narratively and logically it only makes sense for Jean to be the commander. Even in the finale, Armin immediately gets kidnapped, does nothing the entire time while Levi acts as commander, and even after he gets out, that’s *still* what was happening!

22: Detailed post for this would be nice. The way Zeke and Armin escaped paths didn’t make much sense, no identifiable logic for how or why anything there happened - it just ""does"".

24: The scene of Armin and Connie meeting Annie is commonly criticized for its focus on levity and lack of any meaningful confrontation or addressing of past events, especially from Connie. 

26: Opposing the Rumbling directly puts Historia in danger. While there are problems with Ymir’s actions and internal monologue near the end of S2 (one of the rare pre-timeskip messups from Isayama, presumably from not having yet fleshed out Marley), she only barely chooses to go with the Warriors, partly due to wanting to pay them back for eating Marcel. She’s also characterized as not caring about harming the others when it comes to Historia’s safety, as shown when she briefly fought Mikasa. She’d most likely not oppose The Rumbling.

27: First, it’s important to briefly recap Connie’s brief character arc. S2, his entire family is killed. He promises to “never forgive” the people responsible, among a few other lines, essentially set up as being on a revenge arc against Zeke. That goes nowhere and is dropped either S3P2 or S4, most likely due to Sasha living past her planned death in S2, and thus his anger going towards Eren when he becomes responsible for her death. However, he should’ve confronted Pieck about it in the campfire scene given she was part of the gassing of Ragako, yet neither Yelena nor Pieck bring it up. Mediocre (in terms of professionalism and comprehensiveness) post [discussing it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/tzjyb6/isayama_was_too_afraid_to_give_this_fanservice/).

28: Don’t have a post specifically about this, but [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkoLhVZgIj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkoLhVZgIj8), at 15:58 this is covered very well. I recommend watching this rewrite from the beginning if you do. Here’s a brief summary of it: The movement of the Rumbling doesn’t make sense with the Alliance’s trip on the boat. They somehow pass the line of titans on the boat, which doesn’t make sense, and then have it catch up to them, and if not that, then the Rumbling’s movement doesn’t make any sense at all and could’ve been avoided easily.

29: See citation 10 for a bit more on this. A dedicated post on this would be nice, may make that myself. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/1acc3ou/can_you_believe_eren_actually_expected_armins/) covers part of it briefly, the bottom square however should be ignored.  
Part of what the story repeatedly told us through Armin was that you can’t just talk your way out of conflict with people who want violence against you, S3P2 was the climax of this, and when he finally accepted it. Him talking the Marleyans out of shooting the Alliance is a direct rejection of this lesson that occurred over and over again, and is almost identical to the first time this happened. Even as late as the port battle, this is still true; Isayama was pretty clever there, because if you remember, how did Armin's failure at talking end? With him getting **shot in the mouth**. Remember when he tried to talk Kitz (the scared commander w/ the cannons) out of shooting Eren (and therefore him and Mikasa)? This (although really much of post-timeskip Armin) pretends that scene, as well as all of his character development since then, never happened. The cherry on top is that his argument here is awful, unlike the Kitz scene. 

30: Before Armin entered Paths through the Okapi, all scenes in Paths happened instantaneously, with no time passing in the real world. Zeke being healed is not an exception to this, as what took time there was his body rehealing. Yet, for whatever reason, not only does Armin’s scene take place in real time, he somehow knows it is as well.

31: The Pregnancy Subplot didn’t make sense. Like characters in the series noted, pregnancy is dangerous, especially with their level of technology. Why does that matter? Because the obvious thing that should’ve happened is having Zeke impregnate people over the very long stretch of time he was working with them so they don’t needlessly endanger Historia’s life, especially since they talked plenty about the dangers of an assassination of her with the 50-Year Plan, which wouldn’t exist if it were random women pregnant rather than Historia. The reason so few people picked up on this problem was that both the reveal of Historia’s pregnancy and Zeke’s level of involvement with Paradis (planning year(s) ahead, meeting up with Azumabito, etc) were revealed in fragments, so this obvious oversight was relatively unnoticed. 

33: Levi’s injuries ended up being a frivolous plot detail entirely hinged on a retcon. His injuries were massive and debilitating, even losing some fingers, handicapping his use of ODM gear. The obvious thing that should’ve happened is his death, especially after getting *even more* injuries during the battle, combined with his Ackermann powers disappearing at the end. That gives us the perfect segway - previously, Ackermann powers never included “rapid healing”, potentially even after Hange saved him. How do I know that? Season 1, Levi twisted his leg during the Female Titan expedition. Days later, during the confrontation in Stohess, Levi is still injured! Then, during all of S2, guess what? *Still* injured. All of that for what was only a twisted leg. When Hange saved him, that’s most likely when this retcon occurred - however, him simply surviving the injuries because of the Ackermann power *could* be acceptable, but him being completely recovered during the final battle - two days after his injuries - is not, especially since he still lives after losing the Ackermann power immediately after. 

34: The conclusion to Zeke’s character and arc was unconvincing and forced for a variety of reasons. The first major problem with it is that it doesn’t address Zeke’s *actual* conflict; his problem was never “appreciating the little things”, it was his daddy issues, that was where both his ideology of nihilism and main conflict came from, a rejection of his father. 

Now, obviously, solving his nihilism would solve his central conflict, but ideally part of it should be addressing the main problem he had the whole time. That part of his character was… partially concluded, but we never actually saw any payoff, any exploration of that conclusion, only his shock at Grisha’s real identity (not an evil person) and nothing after that. And past that, what solves his nihilism is, when broken down, both unrealistic and almost an insult to the readers’ intelligence; it can ultimately be boiled down to “appreciating the little things in life, i.e. precious moments are what give life its value”, and from hearing that Zeke realizes there’s actually value in living. This is his lifelong ideology that’s developed over 30 years, it’s unrealistic and immature for such a simple, obvious thought to “solve” his problems, and for him to have not thought of it himself. Except… he did! In S3P2, we see him briefly appreciating the little things in life to not be like his father, and while obviously not the exact same thing, is similar enough that it breaks suspension of disbelief that this just never occurred to him. 

There’s also it being Armin that makes this much worse. The only connection Zeke has to Armin is Eren; he doesn’t come up at all in their discussion. Outside of that, Zeke doesn’t know Armin’s name or anything else about him. The view expressed by Armin also isn’t unique to him, we’ve seen that same thought expressed elsewhere (ex. Sasha in S2 thinking the same thing, nearly thought for thought), and there’s nothing to suggest the rest of the Alliance doesn’t think the same. Zeke has a history with everyone else there (besides Jean), Levi, Pieck, Reiner, Falco, Gabi, Annie, even Connie considering Ragako, so any of them it could make sense for him to have his views changed with something he relates to - sees Connie still wanting to live despite his family and Sasha dying, having forgiven him and whatever, Reiner relating to Zeke (since he’s been at that same low) and Zeke figuring out from him that life’s worth living, or from Falco going into battle even after the death of his brother and everything else that happened to him, etc. But instead, a teenager he doesn’t know shows up for 3 minutes to tell him “life is worth living”, and his entire life’s ideology is abandoned.

**Non-cited points:** A few of the points have no citation. That was just because I figured there wasn't any point in doing so, that they were simple or self-explanatory enough that the reader would instantly know the issue without context being required, or would understand what's wrong with it immediately. I'll very quickly write up a bit on a few of them for those who are interested, though.

Mikasa walking to Paradis: Mikasa traveled across an entire barren, destroyed continent, starting in what appears to be a Badlands desert, to then swim across an ocean, with nothing except a decapitated head. There is no amount of suspension of disbelief any rational person can have for this.

Plot armor in the final battle: The one argument I've heard is that ""the battle was set up/fake because Eren would never hurt his friends"" The Ancient Titans were, supposedly, from Ymir, not Eren, so that argument is null. But even if it were Eren who did that, it still wouldn't be true! We see them clearly harm the Alliance extremely badly, Levi gets his legs destroyed and Connie nearly falls into the abyss below, so they're clearly trying to kill them.

The battle was just like the Port battle, but exponentially worse in every way; we're supposed to take it seriously, as if it's an actual conflict, but the writing just isn't good at all. And in addition to that, as late as Ch. 130 Eren was still intended to kill (much of) the Alliance, or at the very least whenever Chapter 130 was written that was the case. That topic requires it's own post to show, but it's pretty conclusive. That really doesn't matter, though, considering the titans weren't even from him.

Azumabito-Mikasa Plotline: It mattered because it allowed Hizuru and Paradis to trust each other - that's completely true! What Isayama used it for was an easy reason for the Azumabito to both trust Paradis and for Paradis to trust them. But the problem here is that that's *all* he used it for; it was revealed and then went nowhere, when this should've been something important to Mikasa's character in really any way possible; but instead it didn't matter for Mikasa at all. Isayama even gave up having Kiyomi have any kind of relationship with Mikasa, given she ended up having more personal and real of a conversation with Annie than she ever did with her.

The Alliance: Think of this as encompassing multiple of the related entries. The fundamental problem with the Alliance that caused all of their issues is that everything they did, their claims and their actions, were all theatrics. What do I mean by that? Really, when you break down everything that happened with the Alliance, it does feel as if they're simply acting or pretending to be heroes, like they're putting on a show of being good-guys more so than actually caring about stopping The Rumbling.

They don't think long or hard about anything that matters (see their absolutely unhinged plan to try to stop the Rumbling for example), they (primarily Armin) don't learn from their repeated mistakes, and they don't actually make any hard choices. Take Hange's death for example. We're supposed to believe they genuinely care about stopping The Rumbling, being ""good-guy heroes"" just a product of that. Yet nobody cares at all when Hange, someone drastically more important than Connie or Jean for stopping The Rumbling, chooses to be the one to sacrifice themselves. They all just respect it, because it's not actually about The Rumbling, it's about looking good.

Annie choosing not to go with them was even worse, unbelievably detrimental to their cause. All I need to do is let ""smart"" Armin speak for me: ""I'm glad... Annie... should just keep on being Annie."" After all, being nice matters more than failing and billions being stomped to death, right?

In the previous cases we were not shown something like that, I mean in 6 we were shown a bit of the end of 5, but it was one of the most crucial moments of the anime and the scene did not last long.

\-Beyond that, the appearance of the Panzer unit was very epic, there was a real tension with the machine guns. I mean, the Panzer unit never killed a named character, but I still feel like they did a good job.

\-Zeke's appearance felt quite epic, and you can tell the characters' trust in him, which makes sense, since he's the wonder boy.

\-Something to note was that as many have already mentioned two of the characters in the Panzer unit have photos of Pieck. Karlo has normal photos but the other boy, well: At first glance I thought it was a simple photo of Pieck sleeping, but seeing the image in higher definition, it seems that Pieck is naked and only has a bra. This is very rare, I mean, I know that there were soldiers who had women painted on their planes, but having a photo of your superior like that, well, is something rare. Also, it doesn't seem like the photo was taken by surprise, Pieck seems awake and aware of the photo.

\-As it is obvious the transformation of Armin was great, I have to admit that it makes me the best moment of the episode. Since it exceeds the manga, in the manga the explosion is like a ball from a distance, here it really looks like a Nuke and it lives up to the term of God of destruction.

\-I think many will empathize with Magath more in this chapter, because of how he tried to protect Falco and Gabi. I also liked the scene of the soldiers protecting Pieck.

\-I think there will be the question again if Porco ate the Warhammer titan.

\-Something that personally causes me problems is that Eren did not try to harden his teeth to break the glass, they could show that Eren did not have the hardening so strong, but it feels strange that Eren has not thought about that.

\-Also, Eren takes time to eat the titan jaw, he already had it subdued and without limbs or strength, but it took long enough for Reiner to rise from the dead.

\-I'm anxious to see people's reactions to Onyankopon, they will surely theorize that Paradis received outside help.

\-Something interesting that I found looking in Wikipedia is that the next chapter is called Killer bullet, and the next chapter to that is Brave volunteers. That means that the next chapter will only adapt one chapter, something that hasn't happened until now, that makes me wonder, what are they going to add? Sure, they didn't adapt the entire chapter 104, but there was little that was left. Honestly, I find it strange to imagine that they can show more to lengthen the episode, maybe a longer fight between Eren and Reiner? Or will we finally see the Flamethrowers? Whatever it is, I'm excited, I'm even more excited than the next chapter of the manga.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\-Well, we finally have the supposed death of Zeke. As had been theorized Zeke's resurrection will be postponed for the next part. I suppose it is to leave the suspense for the anime onlies.

I liked that Ymir's appearance felt like a near death experience.

\-The titan appears expelling steam, which makes me wonder, is it one of Zeke's titans that was not killed by Levi or is it entirely created by Ymir?

\-I feel that where Mappa's animation shines is in low-light scenes, it feels with a warm and soft color palette, in addition to that the drawings look higher quality.

\-A remarkable point is what Pixis mentions about the use of gangs to discriminate against Eldians, I honestly don't know why this mention is there. I mean, I know it looks alike, but I feel like maybe there's something behind it. Is it to make a similarity between Marley and Yelena because they both planned to save the world by eliminating the Eldians? It's the only explanation I can think of.

\-At the same time, I feel that the scene of Yelena shooting Griez is at the same time to show that although there are similarities, the mentality is not based on hatred.

\-One of the anti-Marleyan volunteers looks like the Marleyan from the train, which makes me wonder how many Marleyans joined the anti-Marleyan volunteers? Because Griez joined them.

\-Something that was mentioned is Mikasa's design, did Mappa pay attention to the criticism of Mikasa's design?

\-We all know that Pieck was the one who stole the show, his character became more interesting with a much more complex mentality than blind loyalty to Marley.

\-Another interesting point is what she mentions about Ymir's subjects, regardless of the country (Eldia or Marley) they continue to receive the hatred of the world, either Marley or the other nations will bring the destruction of all of them.

\- Porco's appearance is clearer here. In the manga he had a survey corps coat at the scene of his death, I hope Mappa corrects that detail.

\-Ok, being serious. Ashes on the fire? Look, I don't want to repeat the same words as before, but honestly, it's already tired. I mean, the song is good and all but I think the best thing would have been to give a little more musical variety. Something that made me curious is that it sounded during the moment where Pieck tells Gabi that she would not betray her friends, which makes me feel that part of the epicity comes from that; Anyway, it sure is nonsense of mine.

\-Everything is prepared for the final fight, I feel that many could say that the best thing would have been to cut at another point (chapter 119 or chapter 123 for example), but I feel that that would have made the season longer, making this more boring. Also, this is also a good time. If we think about it in hindsight, since the declaration of war there have only been 2 battles, both lost by Marley.

\-In no moment was the scene of the flamethrower, the scene that I most expected in the whole season xd.

Why would they do it? With the armored titan is more than enough. 

&#x200B;

I feel like this could serve to capture the soldiers as prisoners of war. Remember when Falco captured a soldier from the Middle East and then tried to treat his wounds? It seems that international laws force nations to capture soldiers who cannot fight and then become prisoners of war, care for them and once the conflict ends, they have to return them to their country. (This is something that can be seen in chapter 93 when soldiers from the Middle East were sent to their homes).

[The Marleyan soldiers also appear in the manga, but I just recognized that they were allied soldiers and not enemies.](https://preview.redd.it/nrom9b62uus61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b6c306feb43fc6c0ae92941907a864cc88f8e12)

Another point is that the enemy is the Middle Eastern alliance. This is an important point because in the manga it is referred to as ""The South"".

But in the anime this mention is omitted. On top of that, the soldiers in the anime also had a different uniform than the Middle Eastern alliance.

https://preview.redd.it/5knc5vqkuus61.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b5bfa775c3daafd282618d0faef62747bd30442

Side note, the southern nation seemed dependent on horses, while the Middle East used military trucks.

I feel like this is due to the fact that Marley uses military tanks to mobilize soldiers. That is to say, it gave the impression that Marley's enemy nation was more technologically backward than Marley itself, when actually the reliance on the Titans retarded development technologically.

I personally like this detail.

&#x200B;

To reinforce this the cannons are more similar to those of the anti titan artillery. This is rare as the anti titan artillery seemed extremely novel. However, these may be raw prototypes which had to be deployed at the end of the war in a desperate attempt to resist.

And above as ""yapa"" we had Willy Tybur and his family, because it is quite good to humanize Willy, who is in fact the best villain of the entire series (Although that depends on whether you consider certain characters or not villains) .

It is also revealed to us that the children are Willy's children, I thought they were his brothers, and the adult woman was Willy's mother. Anyway, this was finally solved for us. By the way, if Eren is the father, maybe it's about marking a certain similarity between the two

&#x200B;

Magath and Willy's conversation I imagined a bit more scandalous, you know, Willy yelling although that boss tone is quite nice. I hope the mods don't delete my post for this, but, the fact that Willy and Magath knew about the attack reminds me of conspiracy theories that say the US knew about the attack on Pearl Habour and still allowed it .

&#x200B;

Well then we have Eren looming over the military. An incredible job capturing how terrifying Eren would look in that situation, I also liked that they kept the personality of Calvi, a calm subject who calmly awaits his death.

Here I ask you, why didn't Calvi panic or try to run for Eren? Was it because he knew it was useless to try to escape? Did he accept Eren's victory? Was he asleep with wide eyes? I think we will never know.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is also the death of Udo and Zofia. The truth is very sad and it feels more tragic because we got to know them better, although I feel that the series itself did not give so much importance to their deaths, I mean, it is simply one more fact of the chapter and then we continue. I have no problem with that to tell the truth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway, the Eren VS Titan Warhammer fight was great. I like how Magath tries to calm the soldiers down and then we see the warhammer with Marley fighting Eren, it's pretty cool, and in a way it gives a nostalgic factor, that is: Basically you start to think, this is how the fights have been during the Great titan war?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It also solves something about Eren's reaction speed, he is able to block shots, but he doesn't have enough stamina to prevent them from hurting him. In other words, if the shots hurt him, it is not because he does not block, but because the cannons are very powerful.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Putting that aside, I liked the way the Warhammer creates his weapons, he feels magical.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Panzer unit is very nice and seeing the Survey corps return is very epic.

&#x200B;

We also have Mikasa arriving on the battlefield, very epic.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well, the participation of the scouts is very cool. My only complaint is that Magath was unharmed from an attack with thunder spears and an explosive dropped in the room where he was. I know that in the second case he left bleeding, but really he still had the ability to continue advancing and then we see how he is able to continue fighting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't think I have much more to say, except that Porco's appearance was very special and I think the episode didn't end with what was presented in 102, that is, they didn't adapt 102 completely.

&#x200B;

Well, they will adapt it in the next chapter.

&#x200B;

Beyond that, although the CGI is not horrible (It is not like the colossal titan of the third season) if it felt something weird and out of line with the rest of the episode, it felt like a very good definition video game instead of an anime.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Beyond that there are small details such as that they show us the soldiers on the train going down Fort Salta, or that Magath is in fact more convinced that they have to recover the founder. If this surprised me, he pointed out that the Warhammer had to eat Eren and that killing him would only delay Paradis. And in fact it's Koslow who says the Warhammer doesn't seem to want to eat Eren.

I've spent the entire day reading theories, re-reading the manga/rewatching anime scenes and discussing with other folks in order to write this up. I'll inevitably be editing it to clarify some points but hopefully the gist of it is here from the start. 

I believe to have cracked the ending to our beloved series. This theory supports itself with the [Trost theory] (https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/kymub0/this_cant_be_coincidence_right/), by u/elxdark, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lfn9cg/whats_next_isayama/) excellent post by u/YakiBacki.

So, let's first make the anchor point clear. An alternative title to this post could be...

##THE PLAN AND FATE OF EREN YEAGER
----
...but I decided no to use it because it felt a little too dramatic.

Well, let's start with a short summary of what I've pinned down Eren's plan to be. And here's the first ""shocker"": it isn't pure, unbridled genocide.

Eren wants to [expel the Curse of Ymir from the world](https://i.imgur.com/0iZovzr.png) by destroying the Founding Titan's spine  - the source of the titan powers. He plans to accomplish this through a [deal with Ymir](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/b/b7/Ymir_Fritz%27s_story.jpg), who has waited for him for 2000 years. Her part of the deal? To be free. To be born into the world not as a slave, but as a child. To be loved, like the [love she saw and held dear](https://i.imgur.com/Dzn6ZzO.png). That is why Eren promises her to [get rid of that world](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10122000/29.jpg) - the Paths [realm](https://i.imgur.com/Nn9OoU1.png), which only exists because of the power of the titans.

Of course, to accomplish that is a double edged sword: Eldians are forever free from the Curse of Ymir, but they also lose their (by far) biggest military advantage. That is why Eren saw the rumbling as necessary - other nations would attack if the island of devils suddenly lost its only relevant weapon of war, just as happened to Marley when the Warriors were defeated in Paradis. 

""But u/Matt_37, none of this was stated in the story! Eren's childish ""I'll end the titans"" goal is long gone, we've been following Eren's rumbling plans for many chapters, we even saw him telling Floch and Historia about it, and they were on board!""

Well, yes. I'm not sure to what extent Floch is actually aware of the full plan, but I'm one hundred percent sure Historia was informed of it. Referring to u/YakiBacki's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lfn9cg/whats_next_isayama/) I mentioned earlier, it is clear that Historia's and Eren's conversation in chapter 130 is not presented to the reader in full. Which leads me to the second section of this theory:

## GRISHA AND HISTORIA

---

When Eren and Zeke are going on their Paths adventure, Grisha remarks to Zeke that [everything is going to go Eren's way](https://i.imgur.com/S3l6hLj.png), and asks Zeke to stop Eren... but as we know, Grisha still dies [giving Eren both the Founding and Attack Titans](https://i.imgur.com/nH9xa7Y.png) - and not only that, he actually remarks to him that if he wants to [save Mikasa, Armin and everyone else, he must learn to control that power.](https://youtu.be/YeTJ3zSsSfg?t=110) ~~Whose memories are these?~~

Likewise, when we see Historia and Eren's conversation flashback in chapter 130, when Eren tells her he's going to rumble the world, she's completely against it. The chapter goes on to show snippets of Eren's past conversations with Yelena, Zeke and Floch, but when it returns to EH's talk, Historia has seemingly shifted her stance - [she asks Eren what he thinks about her having a baby](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10130000/16.jpeg) (???) who will go on to become Ymir reborn. But wait - why does it need to be Historia's? More on that soon.

The missing piece that solves both puzzles is simple - Eren told both of them his plan to end the Curse of Ymir. That is why Historia and Grisha did sudden 180s and got onboard, in the two remaining crucial bits of memories that **ISAYAMA IS INTENTIONALLY HIDING FROM US**, which is consistent with how he has previously written **every big reveal ever**. 

##THE SLEEPING TITAN
---
Isn't it odd how Eren's Founding Titan seemingly slept through the entire final battle? Well, after re-reading 131, and 133-137, I've come to the conclusion that he is... actually [sleeping](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10131000/40.jpeg). In fact, throughout 131 the entirety of his POV is [*extremely* dreamlike](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10131000/31.jpeg). Let's not forget we haven't seen human, present-day, real-world Eren since he was shot by Gabi in 119 - and we haven't seen present-day adult Eren at all since he started the rumbling. He's taken on the appearance of himself as a child.

The whole thing is extremely reminiscent of a popular theory - Eren would be having his [childhood dream](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10001000/14.jpg), enjoying ""freedom"" whilst the rumbling is ongoing. But more on that soon.

Back to the final battle - it would seem like Eren consciously made a choice not to react to any incoming attacks as soon as the alliance arrived, and left defence in the hands of Ymir.

But Ymir is in on the plan. That is why she took Armin to Paths. That's why she [didn't interfere](https://i.imgur.com/mxqIp0H.png) - in fact, she helped - with Zeke and Armin's shenanigans which led to the rumbling stopping and EY ""losing"".

After Zeke died, the rumbling stopped. Jean blew up the FT's neck and exposed what I strongly believe to be[ the source of titan powers.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50924656523_ca0612a977_o.jpg) 

##SEE YOU LATER
---
There are two parts to this part. Mikasa, obviously... and Reiner.

Eren's whole ""I'm out of energy... I can't *exactly* kill Reiner right now"" in chapter 104 (or S4E8) was extremely weird to me ever since I read it, and it was no different seeing it adapted in the anime. But I finally do not believe this to be plot convenience anymore.

I believe Eren saw [Reiner stopping the founding spine from reattaching to the FT's head](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50924656558_f99fae418d_o.jpg), through a future memory. Reiner's death in Armin's blast is part of he must see through in order for the plan to work. [That is why he looked sad when he said ""see you later, Reiner"" and left the battlefield.](https://i.imgur.com/1Djsorb.png) ^^^So, ^^^Reiner ^^^Helos ^^^folks, ^^^does ^^^this ^^^one ^^^count? ^^^Cherish ^^^it!

Now, Mikasa. ^^^(lol) We all know the likehood of ""See You Later, Eren"" showing up is high as we approach the ending of the story. Well, as noted in the previous section, all we've seen of present Eren's POV after he started the rumbling is himself as a child, enjoying freedom, that scenery and even [directing his speech to his friend, Armin](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10131000/32.jpeg). To me, this is no coincidence. This is Eren's dream from chapter/episode 1. This is why he wakes up crying... Because the last thing he sees is short-haired Mikasa saying her goodbyes to his dying self.

And this is the part where I lose most of my yeagerbros -  the real world Eren is either already dead (Gabi snipe™), or about to die. But this matters little to him if the Curse of Ymir is gone, and the world has been mostly destroyed and will leave Eldians alone. Eren will have achieved his goal.

And because he needed the alliance to be present in the final battle, [he made them hate him](https://i.imgur.com/Uhh7Dj5.png). He made them think of him as lowly as possible.

## 138, 139 AND... TROST?

---

If you, at this point, haven't read u/elxdark Trost theory posts, do yourself a favor. Basically, the rumbling arc has the key events of the Trost arc happening in reverse order. Chapter 137 was another culprit - it features the Colossal Titan transforming, just as chapter 3 featured the CT's transformation that took Eren (and everyone) by surprise in Trost.

Well, let me tell you something. Do you know when that speech of Eren wanting to ""kill every last one of the titans"" first shows up? It's in chapter 2, the one which chapter 138 is supposed to parallel. Do you know what Eren's plan is? Exactly that.

What's more - that happens just before a five-year timeskip which ends the chapter. Interesting!

So - I expect 138 to deal with Eren's death and last moments, indeed. ^^^The ^^^leaks ^^^thread ^^^will ^^^be ^^^fun But I'm also pretty sure it's going to start feeding us the missing pieces of information -  why Eren's titan was seemingly asleep, why Grisha gave Eren his titans, and why Historia agreed to his plan and offered to bear a baby.

That's right. 138 and 139 will slowly explain to us how Eren destroyed the Curse of Ymir. These chapters will show us Eren's full plan. Why he didn't stop moving forward. It will present to us the one obvious solution to Eldia's, and the world's, biggest issue.

Eren's plan never changed.

What's more: You know how 137 was called ""Titans""? [Well, I think 138 will be called ""Humans"".](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10002000/40.jpg) This is from chapter 2.

## THE FINAL PANEL

But... if Eren is dead, how can he be in the final panel holding Ymir?

Well, assuming it is him (because we still have no confirmation), maybe it's a vision or his imagination. We'll know when we get there. The important part, the really important part, is that...

...the man holds Historia's baby, Ymir, and announces her freedom.

This directly parallels (hi Trost theory) the [VERY FIRST panel](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5/10001000/3.jpg) of the entire series, in which we see a back shot of Eren, contemplating his birdcage.

I find the last panel, and its parallelism, to be extremely beautiful. 

It is the epitome of Attack on Titan and its themes.

It is freedom, achieved at last.

##TL;DR / CONCLUSION:

After re-reading 131, and 133-137, I've come to the conclusion that Eren was definitely sleeping/faking a sleep through the final battle. It would seem like he consciously made a choice not to react to any incoming attacks, and left defense to Ymir.

I believe Eren's plan is to destroy the Founding Titan's hallucigenia/spine, that is, the source of the titan powers. He must have made a deal with Ymir, a promise to have her reborn in the actual world, free from slavery or curses. That is why Ymir brought Armin to Paths. That's why she didn't interfere - in fact, she helped - with Zeke and Armin's shenanigans which made them ""lose"".

That is why Historia and Grisha did sudden 180s and got on board with his plan, in the two remaining crucial bits of memories that ISAYAMA IS INTENTIONALLY HIDING FROM US.

Of course, extinguishing the titan powers is a double edged sword: Eldians are forever free from the curse, but they also lose their (by far) biggest military advantage. That is why Eren saw the rumbling as necessary - other nations would attack if the island of devils suddenly lost its only relevant weapon. And because he needed his friends to stop him, he made them hate him. He made them think of him as lowly as possible.

Eren will fulfill his season 1 promise of exterminating all titans.

To keep it clear, I've highlighted the headline in **bold**. It's gotten a bit long, but some of the problems were pretty huge as well as my approaches to solving the problem, so I needed a few more words to get to the point. I'm curious to hear if you agree with my list, or if you have any other problems you'd like to list.

# The Problems

*Problem 1*

**Reiner's plot armor** is just too much. In the Return to Shiganshina arc, Reiner saved himself by doing completely absurd stuff that never mattered again afterwards (because it's just completely OP). ""Reiner transferred his consciousness to the rest of his body.""

It's understandable that Isayama wanted to make the battle exciting, but it would be better, for example, if he could make a short hardened layer around parts of his skin, to save himself from the attacks of the Scouts, just something closer to his previous abilities. If Eren and Annie can use their Titan abilities in human form, why shouldn't the Armor Titan be able to do it too?

*Problem 2*

Another problem is **Mikasa and the Azumabito clan**.  Mikasa is usually a person who is very focused on Eren, but generally appreciates all of her friends. Especially in the Trost arc and the Return to Shiganshina arc, her character really blossoms. She can live on without Eren and trusts in the abilities of her comrades, for whom she is wholeheartedly committed, as we saw in the fight for Armin against Levi. 

 In season 4, however, it's often just ""Eren"" that echoes through the room when she's in a scene. She loses a huge amount of characterization outside of the conflict with Eren, and most of her interactions with her friends and comrades also rely heavily on Eren. 

 Don't get me wrong though: she should care about Eren, but she does almost nothing else and just acts disrespectful to all the other characters, be it Louise or Armin. Not caring about Louise feelings, not responding to Armin's emotional breakdown except with ""Where's my scarf (that Eren gave me)?"" in [Chapter 124 / Episode 4x23 ""Sunset""](https://imgur.com/a/kcHL0NB) was just a slap in the face to many fans.

The treatment of the Azumabito clan is especially sad. So much could have been done for her character here. For example, if she had gone to Hizuru to learn about the land (even in an OVA), even if it was only mentioned and not shown, that could have been used for character development. ""I have a different goal in life than Eren"" or ""Eren also wants to wipe out Hizuru, where I met a lot of good people"" would be things I can think of here.

Ultimately, it only served to explain why people of Asian descent live on Paradise Island. If this connection to the Azumabito clan is not of great importance, she should not have been made a princess, but simply a descendant of an ambassador of Hizuru who was left behind on Paradise Island with his family and confidants during the Titan War. 

*Problem 3*

Since we have already mentioned Hizuru: **The world building itself and the interaction with the world** has not been mature enough in hindsight. There wasn't a single person besides the humans who were on Paradise at the start of Rumbling who stood up for the Eldians on Paradise after they learned they were Eldians. At least, none were shown. Instead, we have even heard Udo saying that Marley is still most friendly with the Eldians of all nations, which only demonizes the world outside of Paradise Island even more.

We were shown gruesome images during Rumbling that were meant to and did generate pity and horror, but all these people would have cheered and celebrated if the Alliance had rolled over Paradise in the same way and killed all the ""devils"", at least according to the story's account.

They should have just gone away from the main characters again like they did with the Marley Arc and shown us other people deliberately helping Eldians, even if only for one chapter / episode. For example, we could have seen in the other nations that Eldians lived together with the others completely normally, that only a few people really hate Eldians there, and that the others have recently stopped intervening and preventing brutality against the Eldians because they fear a war of aggression from Marley, since the Eldians could easily be used as weapons due to Zeke's spinal fluid. Also, the use of hate propaganda by Marley tactically planned by Tybur to cause many people with Eldian blood to flee to Marley could have been shown, so Marley would have more to use in war. We could have seen the formation of the Association to Protect the Subjects of Ymir, built from Eldians of other nations and their allies, to oppose this treatment and fight this hate propaganda.

Or the anime could have shown a Marley family hiding a friend from the police because a blood test revealed she had Eldian blood. We could have a story where civilians in Marley found out that the Scouts were from Paradise Island after the Scouts helped them in a dangerous situation, and in return did not betray them when the police and soldiers arrived and showed a good heart, maybe even wanted to help them make contact with journalists to help them to announce a peaceful living together.

That Hange and Armin had not developed an alternative plan after they visited the Association to Protect the Subjects of Ymir was just bad too... It would have been great if we could have seen how the Scouts contacted the Tybur family to help for an announcment of peace, but failed due to the Tybur family's self-hatred of the Eldian race and so revealed the ""rats"" to Willy Tybur. We could have seen a new plan of Armin and Hange, how they want to contact journalists to publicly spread their words of peace and cooperation to clear misunderstandings, but then received the letters from Eren and had only a few days left to prevent a revenge action by Marley.

It should be said, however, that the possibility of this still exists. Mappa can still produce OVAs that do just that. But at the present time, this does not exist.

*Problem 4*

What many also hate is the plot with **Ymir in the Paths**. Her building Zeke out of the sand instead of just showing that this is the regeneration ability of the Titan powers put so much silliness into the power of the Paths that Ymir has to do everything manually, be it every transformation of every Titan shifter or their regeneration...

The question of who builds the ancient titans from the sand, who builds the titans for Reiner, Armin, Annie, Pieck and Falco from the sand after Ymir has been freed, then comes up. The consensus previously was that the Titan form is determined by the personality and appearance of the person, and that this is done automatically by the Paths, and this is much better for the consistency.

So instead of Ymir rebuilding Zeke's body from the sand, we could have seen a scene where Zeke was created from the sand by the Paths, while Ymir is standing at the tree holding a hand on it, looking at a memory of a child being loved by his mother, who then receives Zeke as well, as Ymir looks to Zeke.

We could even see Zeke for a moment in childhood being loved by Dina, for example when he gave him the monkey cuddly toy before his parents decided to make him a warrior. That would have been a nice foreshadowing for later when Armin tries to convince Zeke and foreshadowing Mikasa's dream of memories of a different timeline through the Paths.

*Problem 5*

The next criticism goes to **Chapter 126 / Episode 4x24 ""Pride""**. The problem is not what happened, but how it happened. Connie and Annie just seem completely out of character.

Connie was no longer a comedian with the Marley Arc. He was portrayed as broken after Sasha's death and feared betrayal everywhere because of Eren. He even asked Mikasa and Armin accusingly after the attack on Zachary if they were on Eren's  side. He has anger issues and is not in control of his emotions. He even almost tried to kill a child. However, less than an hour after this event, he can just laugh at Annie's appearance, whose intentions he does not know, who is responsible for the deaths of many of his comrades and is part of the group that killed his friends and family and that turned his mother into a Pure Titan. He didn't even apologize to Falco.

Annie, not knowing what Armin and Connie are planning, also reacts questionably. The situation is just wrong. She had even threatened her friend Hitch who talked to her for years when they first met again. Many fans simply expected a stronger scene here. Therefore, there are many fan rewrites on this chapter that try to solve the problem, for example: [Connie and Annie fixed](https://imgur.com/a/TvIiXgq).

*Problem 6*

In general, **Connie** is a problem. His character gets lost in inconsistencies. He should have been more important by the end of season 2, where the anime cut out an important moment with him. 

With the Rumbling Arc, with his mother, with what he wanted to do to Falco, with his mental problems due to betrayal of Eren and death of Sasha, something could have been built up to let him die emotionally (Fan-Rewrite: [Operation Usurper](https://opusurper.com/) or [Connie's Death](https://imgur.com/a/hiBVp3k)), which could affect other characters (Jean, Falco, Armin). Instead, his whole character development down into the abyss is suddenly just reset to season 2/3 and that's it.

*Problem 7*

**The fight at the harbor between the Scouts and the Yeagerists** was far too inconsequential for many fans. No one from the main cast died. There are 100+ Yeagerists fighting against 7 people. Even the Azumabito ship with the plane was able to reach Odiha safely.

Many fans had wished for Connie's death here. And that ship should have gone down ([Plot Armor](https://imgur.com/a/iXmouFy)). The Scouts would have had many other ways to get to Marley. Moreover, this could have shown up Armin's intellect in coming up with a new good plan ([Example](https://imgur.com/a/vUDmfUO)).

Also, the situation with Falco and Annie seems so forced. Annie didn't actually want to come along and fight Eren, but then does after she briefly talks to Kiyomi Azumabito and after Falco sinks the ship. Also, Falco is somehow too sure that he can fly in his Titan form. In some Rewrite Projects like Operation Usurper, they tried to hint at this earlier so as not to pull it out of nowhere so much. Some also say that the name ""Falco"" was enough of a hint, but for others it's not enough. This whole situation could clearly have been worked out and written better.  

*Problem 8*

**Annie**'s character is also difficult. Within 4 days of story you had to build a redemption arc for her, but at the same time develop the main story and the other characters to the point where they not only want to stop Eren, but even kill him. As a result, her interaction with the Scouts and Marley's warriors just feels wrong.

In the forest, Annie should have acted more like a bridge, starting with an explanation for her actions in the '57 expedition after she was confronted with them. She could tell how she went into a bloodlust thinking she would see her father again soon, and she would still do the same for that goal. She could apologize to Levi for her attack on his squad, whereupon he could say that he can understand her situation, that she just wanted to see her beloved again, with flashbacks to the OVA ""No Regrets"", and that he is no better than her after the things he did in Marley. However, he could then make her promise to save more lives than she took to make up for what she did, to which he just replies ""Live without regrets"" and thus pass on his philosophy of life to her.

In general, this could have been a great turning point for her character to be less stoic and aggressive and more understanding, which would greatly improve the following dialogue and give her character a different motivation.

Also, that Reiner, Pieck, and the Scouts will work together (Chapter 126 - End) becomes more understandable then because of Annie. If the Scouts could forgive Annie, why couldn't Reiner and Pieck? Likewise, the other way around. It would make the story more plausible and more along the lines of Paradis Island and the outside world being able to make peace when a dialogue takes place. I think that her character could so become another important element of the story and overcoming the past.

*Problem 9*

**Levi's character in the last Arc** also was just disastrous. In Fan-Rewrite Operation Usurper, Hange makes him see his promise to Erwin as a curse and discard it ([Scene](https://imgur.com/a/VKkKLAE)). I therefore see him in a position where he would sacrifice himself to save the lives of his comrades, something he has failed to do since the beginning. Seriously injured, he can still make a Sasageyo to his dead comrades, whereupon he then dies of his injuries, much like Kenny.

Moreover, the explosion with Zeke should have wounded him much more severely. For example, if one leg had been torn off in the explosion, it would have been more believable. This was probably also the point where Isayama wanted Levi to die, but his editor Kawakubo intervened, but more on that later.

*Problem 10*

Another point of criticism before Chapter 139: **the way they defeated the Ancient Titans**. The way it was implemented, Zeke could have stopped Rumbling at any time. All it had needed was Armin to tell him that life had beautiful moments despite all the torment. This is for many too little and just bad written.

After Armin failed to convince Zeke to help, Zeke should just have announced that Eren doesn't even need him anymore, since he is now the connection to the parasite, to the Paths, not Ymir or the royal blood, that he (Zeke) no longer exists in the world, only in the Paths and that he is trapped as Ymir was, just without any power.

Armin, desperate for a new way, might have gotten the idea to interact with the Coordinate Tree (by touch) after Zeke told him about his interaction with Ymir. Zeke follows him and, through the touch, experiences the memories and feelings of happiness he had experienced when throwing the ball with Xaver, which brings happy tears to his eyes (and shows that Armin's words have reached him).

Armin, doing the same, sees his memory running up the hill, but where he stumbles and injures himself, but still with a happy smile on his face. Then, instead of all sorts of previous Titan shifters suddenly joining the Scouts, all Beast and Colossal Titans in the battle controlled by Eren/Ymir just dissolve, freeing Armin (he was trapped in a Okapi Beast Titan) and then set off an explosion with his Colossal Titan transformation he started accidently through the interaction with the Coordinate.

The explosion would shred several Titans and break Eren's skeleton. In the process, several scouts would be in danger, panicking and trying to save each other to avoid being caught in the blast. Jean could use the chaos to get to the head and trigger the explosion. 

In general, that all dead Titan shifters could suddenly control the Titans themselves, that Eren Kruger and Grisha chose to fight Eren Yeager, and that Armin was held by them like the new Messiah was just so ""[Shōnen](https://imgur.com/a/RvVrkIl)"" that many started to wonder why Isayama chose to do this.

*Problem 11*

**The plan to kill Eren** in particular is also fraught with great risk: What will happen to the colossal Wall Titans? Do they then run around uncontrolled and start eating the humans? The Scouts should have clearly discussed this, or the plot should have thrown in information throughout the story that suggests the Wall Titans would simply stop moving.

For example, Mappa could produce an OVA set between the time skip of season 3 and season 4, in which Eren receives memories from the time the Wall was built about how the Wall Titans were created from nothing by King Fritz through Ymir in the Paths and thus don't have the urge to eat humans; and Eren would share these memories with the others.

Also the question what the royal blood is all about and why not every descendant of Ymir has it, should have been answered somehow. In addition, information about the Ackermann family, the experiments of their creation and generally more of the situation shortly before or after the end of the Titan War could be shown in this OVA.

*Problem 12*

Dealing with **Hallucigenia**, the parasite, in the final battle was kind of strange too. It suddenly appeared and then just vanished. The story should have provided more clarity regarding why it appeared and why it suddenly disappeared and died. There are just too many unanswered questions.

According to a popular theory, Hallucigenia appeared because Ymir used it in Shiganshina to connect Eren's body, making Hallucigenia a part of Eren's spine. For the disappearance, there were many theories.

Many thought Reiner would play a big role here, as he was clearly built up from the narrative as a parallel to Eren and as a new Helos who stops the Island Devils. If he had killed the parasite, it would have added a lot to his character narrative.

Many fans even theorized that Falco eats Hallucigenia and thus kills it to explain the dream at the beginning of season 4. In particular, the symbolism ""bird eats worm"" had made this theory very popular.

According to another theory, the source of the Titan powers is vulnerable when separated from the Founding Titan. With Eren's death, the Founding Titan can no longer influence the Eldian race without a connection to Hallucigenia. Since the Founding Titan controls all Titan powers, all Eldians lose their Titan abilities, leading to the disappearance of the massive physical manifestation of the Eldian Titan powers: Hallucigenia.

*Problem 13*

The treatment of **Historia** is also criticized. Her person came far too short after the time skip. How she reacts to the Yeagerists, how she feels about her current situation, what her pregnancy means, all of this is missing. Her pregnancy was ultimately only a plot device to prevent the government from feeding Zeke to her. Many have wished for more depth behind this. Operation Usurper paid more attention to her character and perspective ([Scene](https://imgur.com/a/GODoKtM)).

What's particularly evil is that in the manga, a person is standing mysteriously next to her as she approaches the young man (Farmer-kun / Fabian Stonhard) who later lives in the house with her, as if there's more behind it.

If they had at least shown Ymir being reborn as Historia's baby after Eren frees her, that would have been great and would give the pregnancy some meaning!

*Problem 14*

And what's the deal with **Mikasa's dream**? We are simply shown memories of Mikasa from another timeline, and it is not explained why she suddenly gets them and how. Her only connection to the Eldians is the Ackermann bloodline, and they are immune to the Founder's Titan abilities. So we can't assume that Eren was able to send her these memories, or that Ymir sent her these memories, until we get an explanation as to why this is possible anyway. We just don't know.

But since Chapter 1, there has been the *Theory of Timelines*, which was hinted at more and more towards the finale, but not confirmed.

Brief explanation: Attack on Titan always showed improbable conditions for an event in the show, and ultimately it led us down a path to the point in story where we are now. According to the theory, there was always the case of a condition occurring or not occurring, whether Mikasa's parents were killed by a gang of human traffickers or not (Mikasa OVA), or Bertholdt was eaten by Dina Fritz or not, or Eren was chewed up by a Titan or not, and so on. And each time the end of events was not the end of the Titan powers by Eren, the Attack Titan or the Founding Titan or the Paths sent memories into the past and changed decisions so that another chain of events continued. And since members of the Ackerman Family are completely immune to the Titans' abilities through experimentation, but are still connected to the Paths, they experience [a stabbing headache](https://imgur.com/a/TUBpG4a) when events differ from the original timeline.

But as I said, we never got an explanation in the manga or anime. If you want to read more about this fan theory, feel free to use the following: [Time Loop Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lpy304/time_loop_theory_erens_dream_ch_1_and_mikasas/), [Timelines, Themes and Theories](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/mppxmy/snk_ending_timelines_themes_and_theories/), [Ending Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lxy1q5/most_probable_ending_theory_youll_ever_read/).

And why the hell was Eren in the oral cavity in his colossal Founding Titan without any protection and how did Mikasa know?

*Problem 15*

And now the last problem, which is actually the biggest of all: **Chapter 139**. Here, actually, everything falls apart:

Armin thanks Eren for becoming a mass murderer ([Ch139](https://imgur.com/a/afJummw)). Eren doesn't know why he did the Rumbling ([Ch139](https://imgur.com/a/u68THcP), [invaderzz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GmVCD7cxk&t=4002s)). He could have said that he followed his memories because he can't change it anyway because every attempt to do it differently ultimately led to the event. He could have said that he knew that the Titan curse would end, if he followed his memories (he is the last Attack Titan after all). He could have said that it was an inner urge that he could only satisfy that way (Chapter 131 / Epsiode 4x29 ""Rumbling""). But instead he just says: ""I don't know"". Not only is this very anticlimactic and unsatisfactory for a finale, Armin would have deserved a response from Eren!

Mikasa is now suddenly the connection to Ymir Fritz and not Eren, without even hinting at it in any way, although with the reasoning, Historia and Ymir at the end of season 2 could have actually worked to free Ymir Fritz too ([Mikasa & Ymir](https://imgur.com/a/AIMKhVf)). No one exactly knows why it is Mikasa (""Only Ymir knows""). How Founder Ymir would have freed herself should have simply been different according to what was established.

Eren being able to control Pure Titans in the past makes no sense at all. This concept of time travel was not established in Attack on Titan. We had memories from the future and the past, but no direct interaction from the future to the past.

Mikasa loves Eren, though of course with Chapter 123 / Episode 4x28 the question of why she loves him was opened up. Eren's feelings for Mikasa, on the other hand, remained unknown. Not knowing why and how she loves him could explain his awful behavior towards her, but doesn't make the scene of Eren crying over Mikasa any better. Up until this scene, the point of view was more that he loves her as a sister and not romantically, which is why he always reacted angrily about her caring for him ([Isayama's own words in interviews](https://imgur.com/a/Hetndoy)). Many fans could have lived with him loving her, but especially the quotes ""No, I don't want that!"", ""Ten years, at least!"" are so pathetic and egoistic that they have become a meme. This also completely contradicts Eren's statement from the other timeline, in which he asked Mikasa to forget him and live freely.

The fact that Eren has talked to everyone, including Connie and Annie, and they all react emotionally, even Pieck wanted to talk with him, thus trivializing his mass murder, devalues the relationship between Armin and Eren and the point of view Attack on Titan is trying to bring to viewers ([Ch139](https://imgur.com/a/xqKjYIe)).

How Mikasa could overcome 7000 km and a whole sea without food and other aids to bury Eren in Shiganshina is completely illogical ([How?](https://imgur.com/a/WbKjyRT)). It's also ridiculous how three years after the death of Eren Mikasa sits alone at the grave on Paradise. In fan rewrites, it was rewritten that she says goodbye to Eren because she is ready to move on, for example ""Thank you... for wrapping this scarf around me, Eren. I'll try to live my life without any regrets."" ([Chapter 139 Melius Rewrite (Final Version)](https://imgur.com/a/AqkaJBd)).

But the worst is, for some inexplicable reason, Isayama decided to hint that the Titan curse will return with Beren and his dog Tukasa in ""[Beren - Attack on Titan Next Generation](https://imgur.com/a/kStmqWa)"" after the destruction of Paradise Island. With this, everything Eren has done has been in vain. The whole plot with ending the Titan curse was thrown overboard because he or Kodansha want to leave something open for a sequel to make even more money with Attack on Titan, although with 2000 years of history they still have so much material that they could fill at least three prequel series with 4 seasons each.

A lot of fans want an in-depth story about the Great Titan War. An ""Attack on Titan: The Titan War"" prequel with 7 noble houses and King Fritz, a story full of intrigue and mystery, a battle for control of the Titan powers, while King Fritz makes a plan with House Tybur to go to Paradise Island and leave the continent to Marley. The Attack Titan, as the king's right-hand man, refuses to follow the plan and goes underground with an ally of royal blood. We could see flashbacks about the reign of Eldia in the last 1900 years, and learn more about described events like the Fall of Lago, the Devastation of Monte and the Ravaging of Valle.

But instead: [HINT SEQUEL](https://imgur.com/a/xrJqrFk).

# Conclusion

I am saddened by many of these problems, as I feel that Isayama did not want to take the time to cover some aspects in more depth (time in the sense that he wanted to finish the story with Chapter 139, 13 years, 9 Titan powers), which might have solved many of the problems. Or maybe he just wanted to finish the project and move on to something new. I don't know.

What I do know is that the editor Kawakubo prevented many of Isayama's plans. For example, Isayama wanted characters such as Levi and probably Connie to die, but was always prevented from doing so by the editor's influence. There are also accusations that he discouraged Isayama from incorporating Historia in the story to a greater extent and that he pushed Isayama to make Mikasa a princess to make her ""equal"" to Historia, as the editor often interacted with fans on Twitter who are not big fans of Historia, to put it nicely. ([Interview 1](https://febri.jp/topics/shingeki_interview/), [Interview 2](https://comicbook.com/anime/news/attack-on-titan-season-4-finale-levi-death/), [Last Panel](https://twitter.com/AttackOnFans/status/1064167655245004800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1064167655245004800%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-894393431734227598.ampproject.net%2F2206101637000%2Fframe.html))

In my opinion something happened, causing his story in the last arc (Chapter 124 / Episode 4x22 - end) to lose a lot of good dialogue and storylines that made Attack on Titan so special. For many, the show plummeted because of the last arc. The ending wasn't great, by no means Game of Thrones level bad, as some fans claim. The show just didn't use its full potential for the finale.

I really hope the last Special tackles some issues and tries to solve them, also because Isayama himself already mentioned that he's not happy with his ending and would want to do a few things differently. ([Statement 1](https://imgur.com/a/q3S9uex), [Statement 2](https://twitter.com/AttackOnFans/status/1390785906240544771?lang=de), [Statement 3](https://twitter.com/Brownstragic/status/1594055922044882945))

\---------------------------------

Since most people probably doesn't want to read the interviews in full, I've simply picked out the most important statements.

**First Interview**

Question: What impression did you (Kawakubo) have of Mr. Isayama when you first started working together?

Kawakubo: \[...\] He is quiet, not particularly talkative when we are alone, not to mention in public. He is a consistently polite person who listens to criticism and constantly tries to improve. He hasn't changed at all.

Question: Mr. Isayama, has Mr. Kawakubo had a strong influence on your work?

Isayama: Basically, Mr. Kawakubo asks a lot of questions about the plots and names I submitted \[...\] and brings new ideas into play. \[...\] I often think, ""Oh, that's right,"" and change it.

Question: Mr. Kawakubo, how do you see your role in the collaboration with Mr. Isayama?

Kawakubo: \[...\] In meetings, I point out what I noticed and what I wanted \[...\].

Question: Does Mr. Kawakubo's opinion change anything in the story?

Isayama: My memories are disappearing in a frightening way (laughs) \[...\].

Kawakubo: \[...\] There were many small details, but also few major changes.

Isayama: Oh, but there was one recently. The composition of the last volume (Basement -> The Other Side of the Wall) changed significantly because of Mr. Kawaakubo's point of view. \[...\] As a result of Mr. Kawakubo's hints and restructuring, I knew what Eren really was, and I felt I had finally reached my goal. I think more storylines will be restructured in the future through Kawakubo's ideas.

Much later question: What do you mean by that (Isayama said: Kawakubo brought cuteness to the story.)?

Kawakubo: I live on the theme of ""What people think would be cute?"". I want to bring some hilarity to the story and give fans what they want. Personally, I'm also on Twitter and fan sites a lot, looking at what fans are discussing, what they want, and what they're posting.

**Second Interview**

Kawakubo revealed that Isayama wanted to kill off Levi before changing his mind.

Question: Was it planned to let main characters like Levi and Connie die?

Kawakubo: The opposite of what ending Levi got in the last chapter (death) was an option at one point. Isayama said it is okay to have a story where Levi dies. If I had to say which side I was on, I would say the opposite of Isayama's. Any time Isayama wanted to kill off a character, we had a meeting. If a character's death is ""meaningful"", then so be it. We try to figure out whether the death is meaningful from the story's perspective. In the case of Levi and many others, Isayama reconsidered his decision.",False,False,titanfolk,The 15 Problems of Attack on Titan,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/17njuxw/the_15_problems_of_attack_on_titan/

Or, really, it’s more than one thing - over the course of five minutes, we see nearly the entire Alliance get lobotomized by Isayama for… what reason exactly? I’m still not sure. 

What I’m talking about, of course, is the Alliance’s discussion on the plane, and all the frankly bizarre comments made by nearly everyone there, as well as a bit more that I’ll touch on later. Just going chronologically through this shows all the flaws.

The official Armin Arlert Plan^(©) to stop the Rumbling, let's hear it!

The start is fine. The Warhammer Titan power is acknowledged, which is nice, so it feels as if it… kind of mattered in the story? Problem is, Eren could have just done that anyways, since the Founding Titan seems to just have the power of every other shifter combined… for some reason. Doesn’t matter, mostly a flaw of later chapters than this, let’s move on. 

https://preview.redd.it/zont7ymx0fee1.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49107a1e008199a2558cd33b564f12342b5b345c

This is the point where it starts getting really bad, really lobotomized, really fast. 

**None of this makes sense.**

We the audience know about Ymir rejecting Zeke, while the Alliance doesn’t, so it makes sense they would think that Eren would lose the Founding Titan powers if Zeke died. But they somehow “guess” that killing Zeke will also stop The Rumbling. There’s a lot of things wrong here. First of all, Levi is the one who came up with this idea, which I guess *could* be acceptable since he’s sharp, but not intellectually smart, so it would be fine for him to think that without thinking of the consequences of that plan. He also wasn’t present when the Wall Titan was revealed. But then… **Armin backs him up.** He doesn’t give any worry, talk about the possibility of the titans going rogue, anything. Because, don't forget, the Wall Titans were established to be essentially just giant Pure Titans, and what happens to Pure Titans that aren't controlled? They go rogue. And then there’s Levi’s comment right after, of “that was Hange’s hypothesis”.

Hange, the one who saw the Wall Titan get revealed, saw it start looking around and open its eyes, who was directly told by Pastor Nick about its danger of waking up, who knows more about titans than *anyone*, thought the Rumbling would stop if Zeke died? No, the Hange we knew throughout the show would **never** think that. Mikasa also says nothing, and she saw the titan start looking towards her, at least in the manga, and neither do the Warriors, who knew not to damage the walls (instead of gates) to prevent an uncontrolled Rumbling (never directly stated but implied). 

https://preview.redd.it/7k09o3g62fee1.png?width=3201&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2be0f7a3b81fec27ccbbb936b44db6285508d5

What does this mean? That there is only a single explanation for their behavior and thoughts in that scene; that it was **all** retconned. That is the only explanation that could make this scene logical, there is nothing else. The titan waking up and everyone seeing it was retconned, Pastor Nick’s interactions and scenes with Hange were retconned, the Church Religion elites knowing about the titans in the walls and their danger of waking up (literally the whole secret purpose of their organization btw) was retconned, and the warriors knowing to avoid the walls (b/c of titans inside) was retconned. Because otherwise, this makes no sense! They would never think this plan up, unless someone from another plane of existence erased their memories of the story, and correctly expected the audience not to remember… that was clearly a joke about Isayama, but I know someone out there will hear that and cope with Eren erasing their memories so his plan works or something ridiculous like that, so I’ll quickly counter that Levi and Mikasa are both there and are Ackermanns.

Going back on topic, the point I was originally going for was that either a major amount of the story was retconned, or the whole scene is illogical nonsense that resulted from a highly stressed, rushing, forgetful author, so yeah, the options there really aren’t great. 

https://preview.redd.it/ck1zbop71fee1.png?width=3201&format=png&auto=webp&s=437b42fb4af10be8ae4133fc92c8d433bef4fd1e

Next, of course, is the infamous Reiner dialogue. What’s happening here is really strange; so, as you could probably tell from what I wrote before, the way Isayama retcons chunks of his story is that he essentially “erases” it from the minds of all the characters without any direct confirmation that it’s retconned. Here, we see the same thing happen, but a little more complex; through Reiner’s dialogue, he’s telling us that Eren has been retconned and now wants to be stopped and die, because he’s like Reiner and that’s what Reiner would want in his situation. Now you might be thinking, “How do you know that? This is in line with and obvious foreshadowing for the ending, so that means it was planned all along!”

Except… just 16 chapters earlier, we saw the same scene, but with literally the exact *opposite* message and *opposite* meaning!

[Why am I using the colored manga here? How could I not! The people who made this did a beautiful job, I absolutely love it.](https://preview.redd.it/zhd5ffve2fee1.png?width=3201&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a146e4ce6eab2e3b8a8077c0822b459960bd3b8)

Edit: For some reason, the colored pages' translation is drastically different for this sequence alone (rest of Ch. 117 is mostly just rewording of the same dialogue), and actually *understates* the significance of Reiner's monologue here. That first page above (the left) is the same, and for the middle, what he really said was ""Why struggle like this? **What are you fighting for?** What's the point...?"".

https://preview.redd.it/unz7p56i2fee1.jpg?width=1066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ff644ba48ed71944be1a83462a835e6b4f9907d

Reiner and Eren have their parallels. But they’re not the same, and in one crucial area they’re nothing but opposites - where Reiner wants nothing but to give up, Eren wants nothing but to keep moving forward. Where suffering only moves Reiner towards giving up, towards collapse, towards whatever is the easiest route available to him, suffering pushes Eren further and further towards his goals, gives him more reason to fight.

In that area, they are nothing but opposites - and that’s the whole point of this scene.

Reiner can’t understand why Eren doesn’t just give up, because Eren is nothing like him in this regard, that’s *literally the point being made in these panels*. They’ve suffered enough, why not just stop here? Why would you want to live?

Why not… give up… and just sleep…

Because Eren won’t let that happen, and doesn’t want that to happen. He won’t die here, won’t let himself be killed by those trying to take his freedom. Because, unlike Reiner, he has a dream he’s moving towards, and again, unlike Reiner, has no interest in giving up. 

But Reiner can’t comprehend that - that’s the point. But suddenly, we’re supposed to believe Eren is just like Reiner with suffering? That he’s the same as Reiner in that regard? That he wants to give up and die when it’s too hard, when there’s too much suffering and guilt upon his shoulders, because that’s what *Reiner* would want? 

Yeah, that doesn’t work. They’re directly contrasted 48 hours before the plane scene, the point made how they’re *not* the same in this regard, how Reiner could never understand why Eren keeps moving forward. 48 hours later, Reiner is suddenly the same as Eren in this regard, and understands that Eren… doesn’t want to keep moving forward. You couldn’t make a more obvious retcon if you tried. 

The next piece of information that was transferred to them from Isayama is the knowledge that the Founder can control shifters. This is kind of a weird one. 

https://preview.redd.it/uqgttruu2fee1.jpg?width=1066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9686c7e51bf2bbab369307caf351b1cded64dec

The only hint we had before in the story that the Founder could control shifters was right as the Rumbling started, when Reiner’s armor was unhardened. Besides that, there was no evidence whatsoever the Founder could control shifters or erase their memories, and if anything there were implications of the opposite. 

If the Founder could control shifters, then the Attack Titan “always rejecting the self-righteousness of the king” and resisting his will doesn’t make sense, same as the King not knowing the Attack Titan has memories of the past since shifters could apparently just have their memories tapped. What makes even less sense would be why Karl Fritz didn’t just collect and eat all the shifters (besides the Warhammer) if a huge part of his ideology was having Eldians pay for their sins or whatever. If that was the case, then why did he just leave them to run around in the Eldian Empire and fight the Warhammer and Marleyans?

And the last piece of evidence is something that really should have been emphasized more in the story, that each shifter is *supposedly* a piece of Ymir, her being split into 9 different titans. If they’re each different pieces of Ymir, then it would make sense for them to be immune from direct control or memory manipulation from the Founder, and especially makes it more illogical that the Founder can just be an upgraded version of every other shifter combined. At that point, besides the Attack Titan, why is her power even split into those 7 other titans? The Founding Titan already has *everything* they do, at least in the final episode.

Going back on track, why and how do the characters know the Founder is capable of this? As far as I’ve been able to tell from looking into this, there’s no explanation as to how. It would be one thing if they just presumed Eren could because of Reiner’s armor being unhardened, but that isn’t what happens. 

https://preview.redd.it/8xb2rph83fee1.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e2f6071495d08a862f366961893660bd4a14153

Armin just declares, fully confident that it is true, that he doesn’t know why Eren isn’t controlling them or taking their powers away, **as if it was a well-known fact the Founder could do so**. I tried to find any hint that this was a thing earlier in the story, but couldn’t find anything. 

The final thing I want to mention is much more subtle. The “plan” the Alliance had when attacking Eren was atrociously bad, and unlike anything else in the series. For much of the rest of the show, battles were written intelligently and strategically, like how they would be in real life. The only incompetency we saw was because of incompetent characters, not incompetent writing. But for this battle, crucial parts of what should’ve and would’ve been considered were ignored simply because the author knew they wouldn’t be needed. 

Let's take a step back and consider the situation they’re in. The Alliance is going up against the Founding Titan. What do we know about it? We know it has basically unlimited power, can control pure titans and apparently shifters too, and can tap into the memories of Eldians to see what they’re seeing or what they know. We also know that it has one weakness; it cannot interfere with Ackermanns, it cannot read their minds, and it cannot control them, and therefore it cannot know where they are at all times, unlike everyone else in the plane. So logically, what would you base a lot of your plan around? The two Ackermanns and their ability to be basically invisible to Eren. 

Even after Eren’s little monologue about their freedom and not controlling them or whatever, that doesn’t change this whatsoever.

Everyone and everything else in the plane, besides Armin’s Colossal explosion, has no possibility of killing Eren, because he can just see where they are and obliterate any attempts to take his life, whether through Warhammer hardening, controlling Wall Titans, or the Ancient Titan nonsense they find out about later. That means the only way to kill him would be to figure out where he is, and have an Ackermann take him out from behind his vision, because that is the only real way he could be stopped. Unless, of course, a 4-dimensional puppeteer could see the future, and knew that competency wasn't needed because the Founder secretly went crazy but only during convenient moments, so having no plan at all was all they needed...

For the last piece of Alliance lobotomy served to the audience, we have this right here.

…

***“What were they thinking?!”***

So basically, this is Armin’s logic here. Eren said he was just going to keep moving forward, that they’re going to collide and fight. All these titans showing up to fight them after the Alliance showed up to kill him must therefore be from the Founder Ymir.

^(what)

I’m not going to spend my time talking about why what's presented in the 133 pages is also bad, because “really bad writing” is higher of importance for me than “kinda bad writing”, and I don’t want this to go on forever. 

But the thing is, even with the Eren presented to us in 133 onwards, what Armin’s thinking in 135 makes absolutely no sense. In 133 Eren said they were going to fight, going to collide, that they’d have to kill him for him to stop. So then why would he not use the Ancient Titans against them? If it’s in the arsenal of Founding Titan powers, of course he’d use it! I’m trying to put into words just how ridiculous this is, but I don’t know if I even can. Was Isayama expecting us to forget what was said... two chapters earlier? Was it retconned after *two chapters*? It’s just… ***“What were they thinking?!”***

There’s some more to it than that, but I think that’s enough. Everything I’ve just mentioned is obvious stuff, it’s not like I’m making or expecting some ultra-detailed plan like Erwin constantly had. This is just what regular people would figure out almost instantly in their position. Yet somehow **nobody** thinks of an intelligent plan, not even the supposedly smart Armin, whose only plan is to try to talk to Eren (but then immediately cut from the plan) and then explode on him, and literally nothing else. No critical thinking about the Founder’s flaws, no actual “plan”, since what they “planned” is much more like a one second outline than anything, and it just results in them running around aimlessly, fighting like a Marvel movie - or should I say, Guardians of the Galaxy movie. Not to mention all the absurd, meta knowledge forced in from Isayama that has no root in the actual story.

It’s just disappointing and disappointing writing.

This is the reason, so no, this was never Eren showing Grisha a Paradis without walls or baby Ymir like many people theorized, this was always Grisha getting overwhelmed with rage and emotions in this exact moment after finding out about Carla's death (we even see Grisha's demeanor change after he hears about her death and the first thing he immediately says is for Eren to avenge her).

In chapter 121 we see Eren manipulate Grisha in the exact moment where he killed the royal family, but once Grisha got out of the cave, he asked Eren about what happened to Carla and for some reason Eren didn't do anything like he did back in the cave.

Instead he allowed Grisha to know about Carla's death through Kid Eren later on.

Grisha was against the killing of the Reiss children, but he still ended up doing if after Eren manipulated him to do so, just like he was against the rumbling even though he still ended up going forward with it.

Grisha saw Eren's future memories of That Scenery, which is Eren unleashing the rumbling upon Marley in 131, so even though Grisha was against it at first, he still went forward with it in a moment of weakness and pure rage towards the people that killed his wife.

We see Grisha tell Eren multiple times to avenge his mother, but what Grisha didn't knew was that Eren would unleash the rumbling upon the entire world, since like i said he only saw The Rumbling/Scenery of chapter 131 since that is the moment that Eren finally reveals to the audience what The Scenery/Sight (depending on the translation, since chapters 121 uses both) and it's nothing more than the rumbling being unleashed on Marley, the nation responsible for everything bad in Grisha's life, whether it's the death of Faye or the deaths of both of hs wifes.

It's like Zeke said, Eren can manipulate Grisha and show him exactly what he wants while at the same time hiding something from him.

Eren knows that the Rumbling/Scenery means him unleashing it upon the **entire world** since that was his most darkest, selfish and deepest desire/fantasy, but Grisha doesn't know that, so all Grisha sees is Eren destroying Marley in chapter 131.

That is why Grisha and the other titans hifters joins the fight in chapter 137 against Eren, since Eren tricked Grisha into destroying the entire world.

Deep down, in Grisha's last moments the man was a fucking emotional mess and even as we saw in this latest episode, the man was screaming out loud like a maniac towards future Eren even though he couldn't really see him.

And this was after his future son manipulated him to kill innocent children, so yeah, Grisha clearly wasn't having a good day and not only that but a few hours or days later, he finds out that his wife died in the Marleyan invasion.

Grisha is not a perfect man, in fact he is deeply human and flawed and allows his emotions to get the better of him and that is why he gave his powers to Eren, because deep down in that moment he just wanted revenge against those that took everything from him.

EDIT:  **Now that i think about it, from the perspective of the ANR theorists, Eren showing Grisha a baby Ymir in a Paradis free of walls isn't even consistent since not only is Ymir born/reeincarnated, but the curse of the titans is also broken after her birth, so how can Eren show Grisha memories of her daughter in this new world free of walls and curses if he doesn't have the powers of the Attack Titan anymore after her birth**.",False,False,titanfolk,The reason why Grisha gave Eren the powers of the Founder - (Lots of pictures),0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/si63fg/the_reason_why_grisha_gave_eren_the_powers_of_the/

Sorry for bad formatting, i wrote this on my phone and English isn't my first language 

I know it's been 3 years since the ending, but i like to read new theories and memes once in a while here. And i notice some same discussion over and over again, like the plot armor too thick, why 80% rumbling, why x happened etc. This theory could explain most of the plot holes and retcon in the ending.

We all know the story of ymir, how she was a slave that freed the pigs because why not (maybe she already loved king frizz at this point and wants him to cut his bacon intake lol) and then be punished for that. After she ran into the woods and got the titan power, she still submits to king frizz even though she can Destroy his entire village/kingdom if she want to. Well that's because she's still his slave in her heart (or simp or deeply in love, depends on how you look at it). Even after she been told to destroy king frizz's enemy, after she gave birth his children, after she was dead and spawn in the path dimension, her heart still is a slave to king frizz and his descendents. After thousands of years building titans by herself she realizes her wellbeing isn't healthy to still be a slave after eternity, somehow she cant just quit by herself so she need a catalyst, the moment where she saw mikasa kissing eren decapitated head, she finally break free end the titan curse

Now how on earth she gets to the catalyst and achieve freedom with that very specific circumstances? Remember how the path dimension are very powerful like you can build titans then sends them to the real world and times works differently there. Also we know that alternative timeline exist in aot, like when eren and mikasa escape to a cabin and in chapter 1 we see eren waking up from a dream that's actually the alternative timeline, imagine if ymir could reset and manipulate the  present time line to achieve the desired catalyst event? A steins gate if you can call it. That's why mikasa got those headache, from ymir constantly manipulating and resetting the time line.

Important members of the alliance died so mikasa couldn't swoop in to kill and kiss eren? New timeline until the desired thickness of the plot armor

Eren achieve 100% rumbling? Cant have that, timeline reset

Historia got bang by her childhood bully? Who cares doesn't affect that much

Annie instantly get along with her friends? Sure no problem

This also explain why eren is feeling stupid, useless and chained by his destiny because he know what ymir trying to accomplish, eren can see the string that he is just a puppet to do her bidding. That's why eren is forced to kill his own mother in the past, that's why he suddenly attracted to his step sister O⁠_⁠o, all to accomplish the catalyst of mikasa kiss and kill eren


Why we got this ending

There's an article somewhere that is isayama/yams scraped the original ending because it was too dark, we don't know how it goes but i assume its the 100% rumbling, think about it, it was dark, eldians could got peace without external threat from hatred, racism, and eren could achieve it easily, but of course we cant justify genocide. How about zeke plan? Nihilism sounds boring and not enough action. So yams picked the middle ground, 80% genocide, plenty of action, the alliance stop the rumbling and become the hero. I dont mind with the theme of the cycle never ends, fallout theme is basically that, war never changes, even after the nuclear apocalypse. But aot was executed badly

I’ll be making a post for everything we know about the anime very soon. Keep an eye for my comment under this post as I’ll add a link to that post once it’s up. 

This post specifically will be a deep dive into the leaks that have to do with the pacing of Season 4 Part 2. I'll be establishing a quantifiable method of looking at how long certain chapters take to adapt and then combining that information with the leaks to speculate on and analyze the upcoming episodes. Note that when I say pacing I mean *adaptational* pacing, ie. if manga content is cut, adapted or added to, and NOT the actual flow of the story.

Here’s a guide for the different sections:

**- The purpose of this post**

**- The leaks**

**- Looking at the upcoming episodes**

**- Conclusion**

**- TL;DR**

Because of how comprehensive this post is, unless you’re really into this topic then my recommendation is scroll down to the **TL;DR** to hear my point, and if you want a more intensive breakdown on everything then read from the beginning.

# THE PURPOSE OF THIS POST

This is somewhat of a sequel to the post I made a little over a year ago, for Season 4 **Part 1**. You can check that out [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/kbq44g/a_word_of_warning_on_the_pacing_of_the_final). 

Like the previous post, there are three main functions of this post:

* **Summarize the current speculative information out there regarding which episodes will cover which chapters**
* **Assess the value of this pacing**
* **Give an overall understanding of a good adaptational rate in the context of the AoT anime**

The initial post came about because I saw a need to explain how the leaks for Part 1 indicated the anime would rush through the manga content. I anticipated the main leak regarding the pacing (Episode 16 covering Chapter 122) being wrong and emphasized this many times, but in spite of that it was worthwhile to make the post anyway as many people seemed to be under the impression that 2 chapters per episode (Or ""2x pacing"" for short) was the general pacing for the anime. The point was to convey how if Part 1 was indeed doing a 2x adaptation, we should anticipate a lot of skipped content. Likewise, *this post* is inspired by many people assuming the contrastingly *slow* pacing of the leaks for Part 2 is a good sign. It very well could be depending on what you want out of an anime adaptation, but overall I want to spread awareness of the subsequent changes that we'll be seeing, namely filler. 

Note that Part 1's pacing defying the implications of the leaks was precisely because the leaks were wrong. They didn't successfully pull of a 2x adaptation, they ended up with about a 1.6x adaptation so there were less cuts than expected. Ending at Ch116 meant it was way less rushed than Ch122, but it was still more rushed than Ch114 which was my recommendation. Hopefully that demonstrates my capability in accurately approximating the ideal pacing for the anime. You'll also see my flesh out my reasoning as this post develops. 

Admittedly, I went a little overboard with the post, including word counts and multiple graphs. But I want to be thorough for the sake of both supplementing my conclusion with adequate arguments and to hopefully be entertaining for the two or three people that won’t be bored out of their minds reading it. Additionally, I think this really intensive breakdown of this unique topic holds merit even though the anime is coming out in a couple of weeks. You won't see something like this anywhere else, folks.

So with that out of the way, let’s get into it.

# THE LEAKS

All of the leaks will be coming from Paolo, who is a leaker not by his own admission -- He essentially just has access to sources that know leaks which he hints to and eventually confirms on his twitter. Either way, his leaks for Part 1 that I used in the previous post turned out correct \[[1](https://i.imgur.com/nfrfApu.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/UvaDj1t.png)\] and for the sake of the topics pertaining to this post he's been accurate. The Part 1 leaks that ended up being wrong were from another source, and I still don't know what happened there.

Information is still coming out so we could get even more specific about certain episodes, however for the point that I’m making there’s an abundance of evidence for it so more details won’t change anything. And even if tomorrow Paolo tweeted all of his leaks were made up I would still consider this exploration valuable, as like with the initial post this is more about the broad concept of adaptational pacing itself.   

So, let’s get to the leaks. There are **THREE MAIN ASSUMPTIONS** driving the thesis of this post:

**There will be 12 episodes** (1), **The anime will only adapt up to Chapter 130/131 of the manga** (2), and **Episode 5 will cover content from Chapters 121, 122 & 123**.

I'll briefly summarize how all this information came to light. Most of it is leaks so again it comes with the caveat of all of it potentially being wrong. 

**12 EPISODES:**

So, there’s a basis for this outside of just leaks.

The anime Kingdom, which airs on NHK and the same timeslot as Attack on Titan and will replace it once it’s done, has been confirmed to begin airing on [the first Sunday of April.](https://kingdom-anime.com/onair/) What this means is that Attack on Titan must cease airing before that date. From the 9th of January, the first episode of Season 4 Part 2, to Kingdom's premiere, there are *12 Sundays*. Therefore *12 episodes.*

This is the same method people used to figure out Part 1 would have 16 episodes before the leakers and eventually the episodes confirmed it.

Additionally, tweets from Paolo gradually [alluded to this number](https://i.imgur.com/yJvaU9f.png) and eventually [treated it as fact](https://i.imgur.com/gTAYyL4.png). 

So assuming both sources of information -- The timeslots and the leaks -- can accurately tell us about the episode count, then 12 episodes is what we're working with.

Naturally, a lot of people might freak out at this and assume the anime is being rushed, but [it most definitely isn't](https://i.imgur.com/0t18nTx.png). This is because of both the second and third main leaks.

**ENDING AT CHAPTER 130/131:**

There are conclusions you can draw from Part 2 of the anime not completing the manga, such as movie rumors or a Part 3, but for the sake of this post it's irrelevant. There won't be speculation on what format the finale of the anime will take as we are simply discussing Part 2 of the anime.

For this point specifically, Paolo is seemingly unsure [where exactly the anime will end](https://i.imgur.com/E4PRWn1.png), hence the ambiguity in this assumption for the pacing. However, for when we get into specifics I'll give the anime the benefit of the doubt and assume a Chapter 131 ending, to show that even with an extra chapter the pacing is on the slower side. 

The next bit of info is what narrows down the pacing to show just how slow it'll be, and where.

**EPISODE 5 LEAKS**

So Episode 5 was the main thing Paolo alluded to. A lot. With access to Episode 5’s storyboard, he’d been hyping it up visually and content-wise. This is because it's shaping up to be the equivalent of Season 2's Episode 6 and Season 3's Episode 17. [He hinted at it](https://i.imgur.com/dplzgcI.png) and eventually dropped the information through the same [puzzle](https://i.imgur.com/w4PDOBa.png) he'd done twice previously (For a S4 Key visual and Episode 4x9 -- Both of which were correct). 

Applying the same method, the episode number he's talking about here is Episode 5, and it implies content from [Chapter 121, 122 AND 123 will be in this.](https://i.imgur.com/2FiykmW.png) This pacing is good here. While there’s three chapters, only Chapter 122 is being adapted in its entirety (And it has barely any dialogue) with only a third to a quarter of Chapters 121 & 123.

There's a lot more leaks about details of Episode 5, but I'll save those for the bigger summary post linked in the comments. But basically this is the [flow of events](https://i.imgur.com/JYUYCgX.png): Ch121 Reiss slaughter --> Ch121 finale --> OP --> Ch122 ALL --> Ch123 finale.

Here’s why this leak about Episode 5 tells us a lot about the pacing. 

The natural assumption for anyone who’s speculated deeply about the pacing of the AoT anime is that Episode 1 would primarily be the action-heavy Chapter 117, with scenes from Chapter 118 sprinkled in as well as the one scene from Chapter 115 that was cut from Part 1, and then Episode 2 covering the rest of Chapter 118 and all of Chapter 119, which is also very action-heavy (Action-heavy chapters take up less time when being adapted).

However, the fact that the chapters covered in Episode 5 are *in* Episode 5 means that the battle in Shiganshina portion of the story will be more stretched out than it is in the manga. Given Episode 4’s content too, it’s a reasonable assumption that Chapter 119 will instead happen [at the end of Episode 3.](https://i.imgur.com/GQHMSyI.png) And like with me assuming the anime will end at Chapter 131 instead of Chapter 130, that’s being charitable to the anime. Because if we’re not done with Chapter 119 by Episode 3, oh boy then it’s even slower. 

So three episodes, covering three chapters, technically 3 and ¼ if you take into account the Ch115 scene. On average, that’s a **1.03x pacing** for those first episodes. Very, very slow, especially when you consider the chapters are mostly action, which in Season 3 Part 2 manifested in a lot of 2x pacing.  

This seemingly small adjustment of Chapter 119 being at the end of Episode 3 instead of the natural assumption of Episode 2 means there’s now an extra 20 minutes to make up which definitely evokes concern about filler. The last few episodes in a roundabout way also have the same potential issue, though it’s less concrete as the content of those episodes is more nebulous than the first few. More on that later. 

So, how do we quantify these perceived pacing issues? Well first, a summary of what we know about what chapters will be covered in what episodes: 

**-** EP1-3: ??

**-** EP4: ??-121 \[[Here](https://i.imgur.com/60v0S1I.png)\]

**-** EP5: 121-122-123 \[[Here](https://i.imgur.com/w4PDOBa.png)\]

**-** EP6-7: ??

**-** EP8: 126 \[[Here](https://i.imgur.com/asHGC1R.png)\]

**-** EP9-12: ??

You could make assumptions for the *??* parts, but the above summary is stuff that has been explicitly confirmed by Paolo. Again, Chapter 119 is most likely going to be at the end of Ep3 with Chapter 120 in Ep4, and Chapter 131 in Ep12 if it’s there at all but we don’t know for sure.

Now, in order to fill in and analyze those gaps, let's get into that quantifying I promised. This is where it gets fun (For me at least).

# LOOKING AT THE UPCOMING EPISODES   

So for reasons that should be obvious, action can always be done quicker than dialogue when it comes to anime adaptations. This means that the amount of chapters that can be covered in a single episode depends on how much dialogue there is.

This seems to be commonly understood and you'll often see practical applications of this when it comes to AoT -- I know I’ve seen comments like “There’s a lot of action in this chapter so it will probably only be half of an episode”, or the flipside “This chapter has so much dialogue that it needs its own episode”. What I wanted to do in my original post is more confidently and deeply dive into this by translating this ambiguous understanding of dialogue density into a more linear and reliable measure – Hence, word counts. The simple way to do this is, well, count the dialogue. Rather, any words spoken or thought by characters or the narrator that would take up time in the anime. This is how we can roughly quantify the density of each chapter. In the last post I used the RTS and Marley arc chapters, and for this post I’ve counted Chapters 117-131.

Keep in mind there's a margin of error here due to the English translation, so rather than viewing this as an exact word count for each chapter, try to see it as something that illustrates the chapters with heavy dialogue versus light dialogue. As I said, it gives an idea of the density of each chapter.

Below is all the chapters I've done word counts for. I already had most of them done for the previous post and recently added the S4 Part 2 ones. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e4o4s2gfm2981.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cad3731926006ccde2bad724f010c43cfd8a0e3

Like I said, it's less about exact numbers and more about seeing the highest and lowest word counts to get an overall idea. That’s why I didn’t include the exact words, as well as keeping the graph more clean, but you can find the exact numbers here: https://pastebin.com/Dn1ZSHfT

Let’s analyze. In the top 4, we have Ch127, Ch125, Ch86 and finally Ch93. While I knew about the lower two being dense, I honestly didn't expect Ch127 to have the most words overall, nor Ch125 to even be close to it. I would've guessed Ch86 would hold the top spot, so it goes to show how much dialogue is in the final arc.

The bottom 4 chapters, from least to most dialogue, are Ch122, Ch92, Ch104 and finally Ch101, with the first two being pretty much tied and with a decent margin of separation from the others.

Now we can use this information of quantified content to take a look at episodes instead of chapters.

Now, this next graph shouldn't be thought of as a display of the episodes’ word count. It’s more of a display of the collective word count of the chapters that were adapted. I took into account manga scenes that were moved to other episodes, but did not adjust for scenes that were trimmed down. It sounds complicated but basically the idea is to get the density of the manga content that was put into these episodes, and not the episode content itself – The range of dialogue from the start point to the end point. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6szo1j4hm2981.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=46e525300bb6ca07b383e8e2b1ca22d7b20669aa

And here are the numbers: https://pastebin.com/uGEFfgbx

As you can see, the episodes with the highest word count tend to be ones that skip the most manga content (Biggest offenders are 3x20, 3x21, 4x2 and 4x3). On the other end of the spectrum, you have episodes that adapted either only one chapter (2x6, 3x19, 3x22 and 4x8), or two chapters full of action (3x17, 4x1 and 4x7). 

The paragraph below is somewhat of a subjective rant but it's very important for this post's overall point:

I decided to include Season 2 Episode 6 because, for one, I already obtained the word count for it in the previous post, but also because it's a good demonstration of the changes the anime needed to make to fill out an entire episode. If you're someone who has compared the anime adaptation of 2x6 to the original manga chapter, you'll have noticed that the direction is taken up a notch to really make the content its own. The director took a look at the content and figured out what made it work, specifically with tone and pacing. It's because of this that the episode doesn't really feel slow and is considered a great episode with merits that go beyond the content it's adapting. Contrast this with Season 3 Episode 19, ""The Basement"" and Season 4 Episode 8, ""Assasin's Bullet"". Similarly, they adapt chapters which completely change the trajectory of the story, arguably even more so than ""Warrior"". Yet, unlike that episode, these two examples are in my opinion... Not very good. There isn't anything particularly interesting going on in terms of direction, and they drag on extremely sluggishly. I think they're a good example of what happens when there isn't much content to adapt and the people behind the episode aren't confident in their ability to flesh out the content. Again, this is very much me speaking for myself. But something to keep in mind. Remember what I said about those first three episodes of Season 4 Part 2 being slow, because we're finally going to talk about that in the context of this “quantified density”.

So the third and final type of display will be adding indicators of the word count of *upcoming* episodes. This will allow us to refer back to that list of what we know of the content being adapted with a closer lens by comparing their density to the density of episodes that have been catalogued. It will be done in chunks of content. First, Episodes 1-3. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5rd1m5tim2981.png?width=1095&format=png&auto=webp&s=b21d4cceea686f2dcda877a3f6f88500430505bb

For the first few episodes, I've added together the word counts for Chapters 117-119, as well as the scene from Chapter 115 that was left out of Episode 16 and divided this total by three.

Of course, the first few episodes of Part 2 won’t adapt exactly the same amount of dialogue, but for the sake of dividing it into three episodes the word counts are even on the graph. Note that even if you give some manga content from Episode 1 *to* Episode 2 in order to bump up its density, it will be an equivalent exchange and Episode 1 will have even less content from the manga. All three episodes are notably rather short. Their word count is closest to Episode 4x7, which remember was a 2x pacing, compared to the 1.08x pacing of these 3 hypothetical episodes.

This post’s title, Filler in the next season of the anime, I can say most confidently applies to these episodes. Expect filler for Chapters 117-119. If the numbers I’ve bombarded you with water down the meaning of the post, then your main takeaway should at least be preparing for these episodes to either be a slugfest or filled to the brim with filler. There is the slim chance that we get another 2x6 and the pacing actually works out great, and with Hayashi [directing the first episode](https://i.imgur.com/9NWBAsI.png) it’s definitely possible, though considering the amount of filler there needs to be… I won’t hold my breath. Also, while the first episode [may not contain that Chapter 115 scene](https://i.imgur.com/O9u4gvR.png), I’m personally most worried about Episode 3, as even if it gets all of Chapter 119 to adapt, I don’t have much optimism towards them turning those pages into 20 minutes. Will they come up with creative and exciting filler that keeps character consistency? Let's see...

NOTE: It is possible that the answer for this is in Chapter 123. This is a mini epiphany I had: Rather than moving the flashback and Mikasa’s internal monologue from that chapter to after Eren’s speech, they could move it to *before* the rumbling. This is very last minute that I’m putting this paragraph here but it makes everything click regarding Paolo’s [response to someone](https://i.imgur.com/IX19Ogg.png) as well as [his profile banner](https://i.imgur.com/uf5ceO0.jpg) that he's had for a while. If this is true, while this would assuage my concerns for Episode 3, it also means Episode 6 & 7 have less to work with. That being said, Episode 6 adapting only Chapter 124 is certainly better than Episode 3 adapting only Chapter 119, as you can see from comparing the two chapters in Figure 1.

DOUBLE NOTE: This is less likely now as Episode 2 has been revealed to share [the same title as Chapter 118](https://i.imgur.com/oIVuR07.png). If Episode 2 was half of Ch118 (The first half being in Episode 1) and all of Ch119, ending on the cliffhanger (With Episode 3 being the flashback of Ch123), then it would make more sense for Episode 2’s title to be Ch119’s instead. So it’s likely this idea will not play out, but I’ll still entertain it a couple times.

With that said, let’s continue with the next episodes.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fbohocgkm2981.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=4639b257f801f8bfce9b3b4f4b003bd42381f773

Now 4x20 is much better. I'm not worried about that at all, and in spite of its seemingly worrying word count, I'm not worried about 4x21 either. As much as I'm trying to quantify this, the rule of density through word count isn't concrete and sometimes you have to use intuition to understand the exceptions. These being, in previous seasons, 3x13 which didn’t cut much dialogue, and 4x7 which wasn’t slow, despite their word counts suggesting the contrary. So 4x21 (Episode 5 of Part 2) having not many words is no big deal, as Chapter 122 will take up more time than its word count suggests. If it was an action chapter then its lack of dialogue would indicate moving quickly, but its prominence of imagery meant to convey a passage of time means it should be a reasonable chunk of the episode. Note that Paolo has said he’s seen additional shots for Ymir’s backstory and in Eren’s speech in the storyboard, but these might not necessarily be entire scenes so I won’t go into depth until I write the post summarizing the changes. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t55u3z4mm2981.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c0d073118f7c409001d8a56d455a9f1c860cca0

This next one is a lot more speculative but it definitely seems like enough dialogue to sustain two episodes. The dialogue for Chapter 123’s flashback is listed here, so it’s assuming it doesn’t get moved to Episode 3 which as I said is less likely now that we know Episode 2’s title. Since the leak is Episode 8 will entirely be Chapter 126, it’s actually feasible we get Episode 7 being fully Chapter 125 when you look at its word count here. Though feasible, it feels unlikely to me because Chapter 125 might not be seen as a particularly cinematic episode from an anime director’s perspective. Don’t get me wrong, I love me some Chapter 125. The tone and scene transitions are immaculate. But I’m not sure.

From a pacing standpoint though, I expect the main chapter of Episode 7 is Ch125, regardless of if that Ch123 rearrangement happens. Subsequently, Episode 6 is either the Ch123 flashback and Ch124 (Or some of Ch124, with the remainder being in Episode 7), or entirely Ch124 if my epiphany ends up happening.  

There’s also the hopefully unlikely possibility where Episode 6 is just the Ch123 flashback with a bunch of a filler to fill up an entire episode, then a recap of Ch123, causing Episode 7 to be the entirety of Ch124 and Ch125 crammed into one episode. ^(Please don’t.) 

Either way, the pacing of this portion *could* be bad but will most likely be decent.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oh34frwnm2981.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6d8c1e486b7bdd9fab8e4d382f3e8454017e219

Sadly I don't have much to say about Episode 8 on account of my caution towards inspiring discussion in the comments about Chapter 126, which is frankly exhausting. From a pacing standpoint, though, I think it's possible to make it work. There's plenty of opportunities to make filler seem natural instead of, well, filler. Because of the nature of the plot progression and emphasis on character interactions it feels like it’s harder to fuck up additional scenes here, rather than other areas like Ch119 where I’d worry about stalling in the midst of a battle and Ch123 where it would feel like unnecessary fluff that panders to people with a preference for the 104th characters. The reason I think there’d be filler here is that unlike Episode 4x8, you can't use the manga chapter's innate tension as an excuse for slow pacing (And as I alluded to earlier, I don't think it even worked that well) because of the plot progression. What's confusing is that it's possible the infamous pie scene takes place about [halfway through the episode](https://i.imgur.com/wL0BLq3.png), meaning filler needs to go after Armin and Connie have already met up with Annie. This confuses me because the best place for filler in my opinion would be either during or before the Ragako incident, but I suppose they could do something with Jean/Floch, or maybe even Shadis. Though I could be reading too much into what is probably an assumption by Paolo.

Onto the next episodes!

This final section of content is probably the most ambiguous. Not only do we not even know if the final episode ends with Chapter 130 or Chapter 131, but pretty much nothing is known about the structure of the content distribution. If I saw these chapters without knowing how many episodes will be in this season, I would assume it's three episodes: Chapter 127 (**1**), Chapter 128+129 (**2**) and Chapter 130+131 (**3**). But there’s four. So… Let’s try to make this work. 

For their own reasons, let's assume Chapter 127 and Chapter 131 get their own episode with Episode 9 and 12 respectively. This leaves Ch128-130 to be put into two episodes, so two of these need to be paired. Through the dialogue density perspective, Ch128 as Ep10 and Ch129+130 as Ep11 makes sense. On the other hand, through the story perspective Ch128+129 as Ep10 and Ch130 as Ep11 would make more sense. Because of how incredible short Chapter 130 is, I think that Episode 11 in the latter combination would be painfully slow. Who knows, maybe they’ll do something radical like moving Chapter 132 to right after Chapter 129 and adjust around that. Or give Ch128 and Ch129 their own episodes and move Ch130 to Ep12. 

I’m really interested to see how the content of the manga will be distributed across these 12 episodes, but this last section is especially interesting due to how much we don’t know. Assuming we can say we know anything from the leaks about the other sections, lol.

# CONCLUSION

If you’re read up to here you’ve probably got the impression of a slow pacing by the many episodes with potential issues. But let’s look at the bigger picture.

Below is each season’s overall pacing for the episodes that are covered. This will give an idea on how slow Part 2 of S4 will be. Note that I have done some estimations for when a chapter was split across seasons so it gets a little choppy, but the effect is incidental compared to the full chapters they adapt which mostly determine the number.

&#x200B;

Even assuming that Part 2 ends at Chapter 131 instead of Chapter 130, it's the slowest season yet in this respect. When you consider that S1 and S2 both had a significant amount of filler and S4 Part 2 is even slower, it could be considered cause for concern.

The thing is, from a manga reader perspective of constantly fearing the anime not including stuff from the manga, this should be good news because theoretically they have enough episodes and few enough chapters that they don’t need to cut anything. *But* this is often not the case. Both the episode distribution and the filler added may mean we still have lines, moments, even entire scenes on the chopping block, even though they shouldn't need to cut anything. Ultimately it comes down to your faith in the writers' ability to give us filler that doesn’t suck and pace the content reasonably. While the animation studio has changed, the writer for all of the Part 1 scripts and at least the first episode of Part 2 has written for the anime since S1. This makes me reluctant to be optimistic as I am not a fan of most of the anime’s changes, specifically when it comes to character. Additionally, filler is by nature inconsequential and designed to not shake anything up too much, because you need to be able to follow the manga after it's done, so there's the concern the filler won't be too innovative and will just feel like it’s getting in the way of experiencing the manga, rather than supplementing it. 

Again, padded episodes is hypothetically better than rushed episodes. So like every season we’ll have to wait and see to decide for ourselves. Visually though and hype-wise Part 2 seems like it will deliver and like I said I’m very much looking forward to the anime. These concerns aren't getting in the way of my excitement, so don't let it get in the way of yours.

# TL;DR  

* There’s a lot of information about Season 4 Part 2 from leaks that tell us about the pacing.
* Mainly, that there will be 12 episodes which cover up to Chapter 130/131 of the manga.
* This means that Part 2’s pacing will be slower than any previous season.
* Additionally, leaks about Episode 5’s content tells us that the Shiganshina battle will most likely be stretched out to occupy the first 3 episodes unless a drastic rearrangement takes place.
* There will likely be filler in many of the episodes.",False,False,titanfolk,Filler in S4 Part 2? Analyzing the leaks,0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/rtiq0w/filler_in_s4_part_2_analyzing_the_leaks/

Despite what the trailer showed (it showed stuff till chapter 122) this part of the season is ending at chapter 116, and personally, I am all for it. This is a really good point to end the season and I'll state my points in its **FAVOR** \-

1. **This means pacing won't be butchered**, assuming 116 as the ending point, we will now cover around 8 chapters (plus some rearranged stuff) in 6 episodes. This pacing is really good since most of the chapters are dialogue heavy (except 113).This also means that we will get more episodes paced like episode 8, i.e the viewers will be given proper time to breathe between the events and that will immensely help the  *T E N S E* and drama heavy scenes - like the restaurant scene from ch111 and later EMA conversation from ch112.Also Zeke backstory will get proper time, which I'm all for, since most of the anime onlys don't sympathize with Zeke (unlike Reiner who they already knew from the previous seasons).
2. **Production won't melt** \- It is no secret that this season specially has faced a ton of production issues. The animators are working their asses off, the working conditions aren't great either. However, if the season ends early at 116, the only fight scene they will have to animate will be the Levi vs Zeke fight in the forest. Since they won't have too animate the cesspool that was the Shiganshina Fight (which can be later animated with a proper schedule), it will also likely mean that they can pay more attention and divert more resources to the forest brawl. Hopefully that is the case since that fight was kind of underwhelming in the manga (*don't start hoping for 2-D Beast Titan though, there is a reason they made a CGI model, so that they can reuse it*).
3. **IMO this cliffhanger was the second best cliffhanger** \- First obviously being the commencement of the rumbling, ch122 (*IT CANT BE STOPPED ANYMORE*), but to reach that point the pacing required would be more than 2 chapters per episode, we would have to skip substantial stuff.The chapter 119 beheading cliffhanger would have been really cheap, since season 4 part 2 would be announced, literally every anime only would know that Eren didn't die.The chapter 116 cliffhanger is actually pretty genuine, the anime onlys will see the Warrior Crew start their attack on Paradis (*from what I've seen, they actually have grown fond of the new characters*) and Eren walking off alone to face them.
4. **Also I have seen a lot of people here say that** \- ""*They can't end without ending an arc*"", which is simply wrong, since ending at chapter 122 won't end the arc either.The people here think that chapter 90-106 is the Marley arc, which is correct but then they say that chapter 107-122 is the ""*War for Paradis*"" arc (and chapter 123-139 is *Rumbling*) which is **wrong**.War for Paradise is just the name given to the arc by the fans, after the Marley arc, the FINAL ARC starts, which is from chapter 107-139. The proof for this is -Arc names are given by the character information pages at the beginning of each volume. For the Marley volumes, the character pages said ""**THE MARLEY ARC**"" -[https://imgur.com/a/rlEiRYZ](https://imgur.com/a/rlEiRYZ), [https://imgur.com/a/8x0k9I8](https://imgur.com/a/8x0k9I8) (you can check this in the other Marley volumes too, except the first one)Whereas the character information page post chapter 106 are -[https://imgur.com/a/xkcZbA0](https://imgur.com/a/xkcZbA0) (these are from the supposed *WfP* arc)[https://imgur.com/a/aLo1hxm](https://imgur.com/a/aLo1hxm) (these are from the supposed *Rumbling* arc)

**So the point of ending a part without ending the ""ARC"" has automatically been invalidated**.

&#x200B;

The only points I have **AGAINST** this cliffhanger are that -

1. Reiner backstory was skimmed through, it could have been better paced if we were ending this early in the season. We could have spent 1 more episode in Marley I guess but its fair I guess.
2. We would have to wait for our favorite parts to get animated (tbf I can wait lol, so its not a con for me)

3. The current episode titles for episode 11 and 12 also support the theory of ending this part at chapter 116 (do I have to explain this further ?)

&#x200B;

***Whats Next ?***

So whether part 2 will be a movie or an anime is not sure, but what I know is that there will be a special screening when the final episode of this part ends -  [https://twitter.com/Dacsubs/status/1362373579724255234?s=20](https://twitter.com/Dacsubs/status/1362373579724255234?s=20) (its a leak so it might not be 100% true but still)

Also, they might do what WIT did in season 3 part 1 in the end credits of the final episode and show us some scene or a glitch like effect but that is just speculation.

I took the time to type this long-ass post because I've seen so many takes for why ending this part on 116 is a bad idea, I couldn't reply to all of them so I made this post instead. Now I guess you can link this post to those who think its a bad idea (if I changed your opinion ofc) and hopefully change their opinion.

I made this post because so far I am enjoying MAPPA's adaptation and I really dont like the false rumors that are spreading here and there by people who really don't think stuff for themselves and in this depth.

# Overall

* Part 2 will be 12 episodes
* It will cover up to either Chapter 130 or Chapter 131 of the manga. UPDATE 01/5 **--** It will most likely end at Chapter 131 as the chapter is referenced many times in the OP
* The pacing is much slower and there will likely be additional scenes (filler) in the majority of the episodes
* Overall, production is much healthier than it was for Part 1
* There is a huge amount of freelancers working on this part
* UPDATE 01/4 **--** The OP is called The Rumbling and performed by the band SiM
* UPDATE 01/7 **--** The OP visuals are colorful and include (In order) A subtle hint to the Chapter 131 ""freedom panel"" with shirtless Eren looking at the sky and transitioning to kid Eren, EMA as children, An original visual of Eren screaming, and a crushed butterfly
* UPDATE 01/7 **--** The missing scene from Chapter 115 is a cold open to the episode. Unsure which episode, though.

# Episode 1

* ""**Judgement**"" (Chapter 117 title)
* UPDATE 01/7 **--** Mikasa holding her scarf as Armin asks her if she wants to help Eren is near the end of the episode (From Chapter 118).
* UPDATE 01/8 **--** Chapter 115 scene confirmed as the cold open for this episode by preview images
* Directed by Hayashi

# Episode 2

* ""**Sneak Attack**"" (Chapter 118 title)

# Episode 3

* UPDATE 01/7 **--** Info from the storyboards: *Still unsure where it will begin, but the episode will not end with Chapter 119 - It will include some of Chapter 120 too, and* [*this will be*](https://i.imgur.com/4Rj9L7P.jpg) *the final moment.*
* UPDATE 01/8 **-- ""Two Brothers**"" (Chapter 119 title)

# Episode 4

* [The scene of Eren manipulating Grisha](https://i.imgur.com/cxg6R9E.jpg) is in the final moment of the episode
* UPDATE 01/7 **--** The episode begins with baby Eren being picked up by Grisha.

# Episode 5

* The cold open includes [the Reiss massacre](https://i.imgur.com/Pb7Ubcy.jpg) and ends at [the Ch121 cliffhanger of Eren running to Ymir](https://i.imgur.com/yeHGBTV.jpg).
* UPDATE 01/4 **--** The first cut of the storyboard is Frieda transforming.
* Ymir's backstory begins after the OP
* Then, Eren's speech from the end of Chapter 123 takes place after Chapter 122 and the episode ends with [the last page of Ch123](https://i.imgur.com/TbnCHNt.jpg)
* Some of Mikasa and Armin talking may be in the episode but none of the flashback from Ch123
* The director of the episode has not worked on AoT before
* The storyboarder is Hayashi

**Changes: Ymir**

* The action moments in Ymir's story are slightly longer
* There is a very minor addition in [this double spread](https://i.imgur.com/WI02gVP.jpg) of Ymir doing something that demonstrates her admiration for the king. It doesn't show the dynamic between her and the king outright and is more cryptic/symbolic. It doesn't romanticize her feelings for him nor influence anything else.

**Changes: Characters reacting to Eren's Ch123 speech**

* The character in the background face-down in the sand on [this page](https://i.imgur.com/68eDXs2.jpg) is more clearly Falco, and not Zeke, which was somewhat debated in the manga community. He has a shirt on and the angle is more from above.
* An additional close up of Historia's face is shown. She has a sad/pensive expression and is the last person we see reacting. After her it cuts to a brief shot of Paths and then shows the last page of Ch123
* The farmer does not appear to be in the storyboard
* Floch is also added reacting to the speech. He is struggling as he was on the verge of death when the speech started so his expression isn't gleeful or anything like that. It's not a reference to a memory shard either
* Furthermore, around 17 NAMED characters are added to the background. They aren't all focused on and mostly fill out the background instead of NPCs, but you can see some of their facial expressions. Many of them are minor characters
* 1 of the characters' reaction was already shown in a different chapter. Not Hange though *(Speculation: Maybe Annie's father from Chapter 124?)*
* 6 of the characters are Sasha's family
* UPDATE 01/4 **--** Nile and the journalists from Uprising arc are also included
* None of the characters are deceased
* ""Not really"" all of the Yeagerists
* *NOTE: Some potentially contradictory information going on regarding Historia's reaction. Initially, it was said the closeup happens after the page from the manga of Historia standing up, but later it was said she is sitting in a chair. Also, initially a gif of a 1 second timer was shown to someone asking if there was more Historia content, but later the addition was said to be around 3 seconds long.*

**Visual**

* The storyboard for this episode is very cinematic and ambitious. It is also fully uncensored
* No manga panels are directly inserted into the storyboard unlike the episode ""Declaration of War""
* There will be good sakuga
* The Colossal Titans shown are a 50/50 mix of 2D and CG. Eren's skeleton titan is fully CG. The [final shot of the episode](https://i.imgur.com/TbnCHNt.jpg) is 2D
* These [double page spreads](https://i.imgur.com/PkJocWJ.jpg) are supposedly done well in the storyboard

# Episode 6

* Title is NOT ""**Island Devils**"" (Chapter 123 title)
* *Is the confidence of this episode's title due to it being ""****Thaw****"" or is it because ""****Island Devils****"" is Episode 5's title?*
* From this point onwards the pacing is around 1 chapter per episode

**Changes**

* UPDATE 01/4 **--** Chapter 123's flashback is NOT in the storyboard for this episode. It's unknown where it's being moved to

# Episode 7

??

# Episode 8

* Only covers all of Chapter 126 and ends of the chapter's final page
* *Title therefore most likely ""****Pride****"" (Chapter 126 title)*

**Visual**

* Annie looks chubbier in the storyboard when eating the pie
* The pie scene is scene/cut number 180 in the storyboard

# Episode 9

* *Though the leaker mostly knows about Episode 5, 6 and 8 (He has the storyboards for 5 and 8, hasn't confirmed directly if he's seen 6's as well), he has also heard of some stuff about this episode*

# Episode 10

I was exploring some of the AoT wikis, mainly going through side character articles. Eventually, I read through the article about the Yeagerists as a refresher. Under ""notable members,"" it included... RICO?? I was thinking ""there's no way I didn't notice her at all, right?"" 

I double checked and she only pops up in one of the final panels of the manga, only after the Yeagerists take full control of Paradis' military (image below). 

[You can notice her in the bottom right of the panel.](https://preview.redd.it/a26dyqoorf8d1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87e393d944d38983f74bd187e8fd5bad5d93dadb)

While the same panel features Hitch, a character that many (including me) believe she only celebrates Paradis' new military here out of fear rather than actual support, I can see Rico being actually invested in the Yeagerists and their ideals. 

From her limited screentime, there are a couple of reasons one (me... pretty much me) can draw up for Rico's future support of Eren. 

Way back in the Battle For Trost arc, Rico and several Garrison soldiers defend Eren’s titan as he moves towards the gate in order to plug the hole with a boulder. Before the encounter, Rico reminds Eren about the stakes of his mission, telling him that many will die to protect him. 

After the hole is sealed, Rico fires a green flare to indicate the mission's success. She is moved to tears, indicating that Eren lead humanity in their first triumph over the titans and that her comrades did not die in vain. 

Rico is shown to be reserved in her emotions, mainly being analytical in her reasoning (I've noticed that her line of thinking is very similar to Floch's). This is the only moment we see this emotional side of her. This historic moment would have to have some great effect on Rico. 

Ok, here's the real meat of my thought process: How could she be used in Season 4.

For one, I think she could be featured (at least in the background) way more, obviously. I can take or leave the idea of her participating in the raid on Liberio. 

We know that at least some of the Garrison members were featured in the attack. Lobov, the former Garrison commander (and soldier who was shot by Gabi) joined the Scouts prior to the attack as a way to bite back at Marley. 

One concrete idea I had was her being one of the informants the Yeagerists had before their eventual takeover of the government. 

In Chapter 112: Ignorance (and the end of episode 72: Children of the Forest), Floch and several soldiers storm Niccolo's restaurant to detain the Scouts. Floch confronts Hange about not negotiating with the military, mainly Pixis, as it was Eren's decision. He then predicts that the commander has to be drawing up a plan to capture Eren. 

Hange then says 'You're being delusional... or is that what your friends in the Garrison told you?"" I think it was a huge example of missed potential to not have Rico involved here. I believe she would have been a perfect turncoat for the Yeagerists, as she has close ties to Pixis and the other Garrison members in general. 

Another aspect to have made the scene even better would to have Rico in the restaurant herself, bonus points if she’s the one arresting Hange. Her being re-introduced would be a powerful reveal and callback to the earlier chapters since we have one real scene of her in season 2 of the anime and she's only featured in a single panel (and moment in the anime) in the Return to Siganshina arc. Us viewers and readers haven't seen her in actual YEARS.

A second idea I had was to include her in defending Eren during Marely's surprise attack on the walls (episode 76 to 78 of the anime). The concept of her helping to defend the Attack Titan again would serve as an interesting callback to season 1 of the show. 

I can really see her assisting Floch and other Yeagerists in assaulting the Cart Titan. I can see her giving Pieck a good challenge based on what we know of Rico's combat ability. I think her commenting on the different titan shifters and abilities would be interesting, given the fact she hasn't seen any of them besides Eren's. 

Since she's alive at the very end of the story, she obviously would survive the encounter, maybe being injured in the chaos after the Colossal titans break down the walls. I can picture her helping Floch and the others detain the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers.

Past that, I don't see her being an active part of the story. The harbor battle goes horribly for the Yeagerists with the amount of casualties they take (maybe she'd be too injured to fight there?). And there's no chance that Rico would catch up to the main characters after the Rumbling starts. I like to think that she's just chilling on the island. 

Ok, that's it. If you read through this, thank you! This was an idea I had brewing in my head for the past couple of days. If you have any other ideas, feel free to comment or critique!

I think it’s kinda funny to have a post history of like 4 shitposts and then just drop this monster out of nowhere. Hope it’s a worthy read that can spur up some discussion.

(Spoilers for Devilman Crybaby and the Devilman franchise as a whole)

Devilman Crybaby is pure kino. I rewatched it recently and I forgot just how insanely in love with it I am. It is the story that contains my favorite ending in all of the fiction I’ve ever consumed, which is an unfortunate inverse parallel to AoT. I want to talk about it, because not only does it remind me of AoT in a lot of ways, mainly how I think it should’ve ended, but also because I want to have at least one positive post in my history.

So, to start, here’s a big summary of the story:

Demons were spirits that possessed dinosaurs and ruled the world in primordial times. Satan saw their simplicity, their willing disregard of any compassion or empathy in favor of sheer kratocracy, as something to admire, so he decided to join and rule them. God wasn’t a fan of that, so He extinguished the dinosaurs and reset the world to create humans, who are pretty different; we have a much higher roof for feelings like compassion and empathy. We can choose to be good people. This is “humanity,” something that the dinosaurs, the demons, and angels like Satan heavily lack (but aren’t 100% devoid of, we’ll touch on that later). The demons stuck around as disembodied spirits, and found their way in the new world; they possess people and force them to do horrible and debaucherous things, but they keep it on the down-low so they don’t get detected by any kind of authority.

Our main character is Akira, a boy who’s unendingly empathic and compassionate for others, who is possessed by a demon. He’s able to overpower the demon, becoming a devilman, someone who can use the powers of a demon and take on their appearance while still maintaining their humanity entirely. At first, he uses this power to fight bad demons and the series kinda sells itself as an “R-rated monster-of-the-week battle shonen,” but this is cleverly deceptive.

Akira’s best friend is a boy named Ryo, who is really a reincarnation of Satan. Just like in the Bible, Satan is the most misanthropic mfer to walk this Earth by far, and Ryo maintains this absolute lack of humanity or compassion, even in his human incarnation. Yet, he’s still inexplicably drawn to Akira, and values his companionship above all else.

About halfway through the series, Ryo retains his memories of being Satan, and all that demonic misanthropy comes rushing back in. Satan wants to destroy humanity and reinstate the demons’ rule of the world, ignorant of the value of “humanity” and uninterested in humoring such abstract concepts. This is at odds with his human incarnation’s goal, however, which is to keep his companionship with Akira. Satan copes that he can do both: he can destroy humanity AND get Akira to forsake his humanity so he doesn’t have to get destroyed along with it, and instead join Satan’s side. Satan’s absolute lack of understanding what human compassion is deceived him into thinking that this makes sense.

Obviously, it does not. Not just because a human wouldn’t want to forsake their humanity and join Satan, who would be the one to cause the deaths of everyone he knows and cares about, out of just the futility of resistance, but also because that’s simply not who Akira is as a person. He’s the titular “crybaby” of the series, and he earned that nickname because he’s so painfully empathic that he constantly cries for the misgivings of others. He REALLY cares about other people. But this passion is something that Satan can’t quite comprehend; it’s an emotion that he erroneously thinks he doesn’t feel in any regard. He identifies with the demons that don’t seem to feel it, although, unbeknownst to him, even they are capable of selflessness, love, and compassion in great amounts.

In other words, Satan wants “no humanity on Earth,” but also, he wants “the most human person on Earth to stay with him.” He thinks he can have both.

This is foreshadowing.

Satan creates an elaborate scheme where he exposes the concept of demonic possession to the entire world on live TV in the most fear-inspiring way possible. People see demonic possession and succumb to RAMPANT xenophobia. Anyone could be a demon under the skin, be it their classmates, neighbors, even their own children, and there’s NO way to tell until it’s too late. The terror and mass panic becomes a self-sustaining loop of self destruction, where public enforcers start gunning people down in the streets out of fear, countries go to war with each other over paranoia with no true goals in mind, fearmongering propaganda takes over, and society essentially collapses.

In this new nearly-apocalyptic era, faced with the absolute worst in humanity, Akira holds fast. He tries to keep the peace, he tries to reason with angry mobs, and continues fighting demons as the heroic Devilman. He discovers the existence of other devilmen, other folk that have been possessed but still retain their humanity, who are inspired by him and join him in his fruitless endeavors. Despite this force of undeniable, pacifistic, compassionate sheer benevolence, nothing changes. Humanity simply ignores the concept of a “devilman,” as their paranoia and fear have already driven them so far that they see other non-possessed innocent humans as enemies, so what hope does an 8-foot-tall horned winged man have at peace talks?

Over years of war and infighting, and with the help of the opportunistic demons, what’s left of humanity is reduced to a lone bastion, which is the setting of our final battle. Despite humanity standing no chance at survival, nor humoring the devilmen, Akira and his group fights for their sake regardless, clinging to their empathy, selflessness, and compassion more than the humans themselves. As the last remains of the human race and the last few demons fight each other to complete mutual extinction around the bastion, Akira and the last few devilmen face Satan in the sky above.

And this fight is BRUTAL. You’d expect this morally righteous hero, who never did anything wrong, whose been through so much tribulation and turmoil, and fully sporting the power of friendship, to be reaching new heights during the climatic final battle, but that’s not what happens. That’s not realistic. The story doesn’t even humor the idea that Akira was ever going to win this fight. Satan outpaces him easily and keeps dealing fatal blows, which the other devilmen keep sacrificing themselves to save Akira from the consequences of, up until the very end. Satan still wants Akira on his side, but frankly, he just chooses not to pull his punches; he’s not that kind. When Akira and Satan are the only ones left, and Satan deals a final killing blow, Akira dies. The righteous hero just LOSES the final battle.

And in the aftermath, Satan speaks to Akira’s corpse. The realizations slowly begin creeping into his mind. He wanted a world without humanity, and he got exactly that. A world without Akira, the most human mfer around, who he ultimately cared about more than any of the demons he was passively fascinated by. A world without love, or care, or even anyone to live with, all things he realizes he wanted with Akira. A dead, hollow, silent world. And as he begs for Akira not to leave him alone in this world completely of his own making, God and his angels descend upon the Earth to reset it again.

Akira did not win. He wanted to save humanity, he wanted others to share empathy and compassion with each other, and none of that happened. He stuck through his doomed ideals to the end, and died for them. Satan didn’t win either. He got exactly what he asked for, and realized after the fact that what he asked for fucking sucked, and that he was wrong to never nourish or acknowledge the tiniest little spark of humanity that resides within him.

This is how a cautionary tale is written. The world’s injustices are things that can be avoided, yet some overwhelming character flaw allows them to not only persist, but oppress and destroy what is beautiful and just. A more empathic and compassionate unified humanity could’ve beaten the demons, but instead they succumbed to xenophobia and were consumed by fear and infighting. All of this grief and hardship could’ve been avoided if Satan had chosen to understand humanity, but instead he remained ignorant and destroyed something beautiful, having convinced himself that it wasn’t, a facade that shattered moments after he succeeded in his goals.

So what does any of this have to do with AoT?

For starters, the settings and characters of the stories are very similar; both tell a story of a “humanity that has succumb to xenophobia and hatred, allowing a huge injustice to rule over them.” Both humanities have a way out, letting go of such hatred and xenophobia, that they ultimately choose not to take. Both stories have ambition-driven jackasses at the helm (Eren, Satan) who erroneously think they know what’s right for the world, which coincidentally is plunging it even further into injustice, and both stories have the compassionate moralist idealist factions (Akira and the devilmen, Armin and the cringevengers) opposing them by touting ultimately impossible moral philosophy.

The difference is in how these are handled; Devilman is, as I’ve said, a cautionary tale and it knows that, but AoT has no fucking idea what it is.

In Devilman Crybaby, humanity’s failure to reject those injustices results in their complete annihilation, while in AoT, humanity bounces back and continues being xenophobic; the consequences of their flaws are ultimately temporary, enough that they don’t learn their fuckin lesson or get better because *of course they wouldn’t*.

In Devilman Crybaby, Satan is unquestionably a villain the entire time. He has two motivations that aren’t hard to grasp; his grand desire for demons to destroy humanity, and his human desire to be with Akira. His grand aspiration is something that cannot even be slightly misinterpreted as a good or even neutral thing (contrary to “a desire for freedom”), and the fact that it contradicts his human aspiration so heavily is both intentional and what causes him to fail in the end even when he “succeeds.” He didn’t straddle the lines of his desires, he very clearly chose the blatantly incorrect option because he wanted to, and he lost everything because of it. No one could every make the mistake of believing he “chose Akira over his ambitions,” because he VERY CLEARLY did not. There’s no arguments about what happened with his character, it’s not a mystery box.

In AoT, Eren bounces back and forth between hero and villain because “moral ambiguity” apparently means flip flopping between good and evil. His grand desire is for freedom and his human desire is for his friends to live long lives even after he’s gone. Problematically, we have no fuckin idea what he ultimately “chose” because Isayama thought the story needed some determinism in the mix to spice things up, and in just chapter 139 alone you’d be able to find panels claiming he picked either option. Regardless, he was punished, not because he chose the *wrong* option, but because there was no right option, because he was fated to lose and die either way. This is not a character climax, it’s just a disregard of character at the climax in favor of *God knows what kind of demon chapter 139 truly is.*

In Devilman Crybaby, Akira is the moralist hero that sticks to his ideals to the end. He doesn’t have an answer to truly solve humanity’s problems, but that’s okay, because all he has to do is oppose the completely objectively evil faction of Satan and his demons, so there’s no wrong answer; he isn’t “controlling humanity’s fate” or betraying anyone, he’s just fighting the same evil he’s been fighting since the start. He also doesn’t throw his own people under the bus just to stick with his ideals; the only lives lost through the righteousness of the devilmen is themselves. Not some massive group of innocent people, not some terrified soldiers fighting for their lives, just *themselves*.

He’s no ignorant doormat to his aggressors, either; when an angry mob kills his closest childhood friend and love interest, he doesn’t forgive them or spout nonsense about not giving in to the cycle of hatred, he breaks down and says “GO TO HELL” and murders them all. He has values but also very clear, very human limits. Despite this, he still clings to his humanity to the very end, and instead of being rewarded for being in the right, he dies, because “being in the right” in a corrupt and doomed world is suicide, and the story refuses to shy away from that. It’s necessary for the “cautionary” part of the cautionary tale that these heroes that joined the losing side don’t get to have happy endings just because they’re good people. They DESERVE better, but they don’t get what they deserve, because the world is powered on bullshit. Never mind that fact that his death seals the ultimate defeat of Satan; that Satan’s chosen “grand desire” victory is completely for nothing. Evil is still punished for trampling over good, in a more realistic and poetic way.

In AoT, we have Armin and Hange, and the cringvengers (I would like to use a more formal name but I have literally no idea what other names they go by). They cling to their unrealistic ideals and act on their morality, but instead of being trampled like how most goodness would be in such a cruel world, they get fuckin patronized by the writer because they’re the main characters.

*“Feeling human reactions like hate for those who have unforgivably wronged you?” No, they’re above basic vital human concepts like that, because being above negative emotions is how you write “mature” characters, right? “Sure, this child intentionally and unapologetically killed one of our closest friends of many years, but we’re above feelings like “spite” so it’s all okay.”*

*What’s that, you think it’s crazy that ALL of them survived the battle of heaven and Earth? Well, shut up. It doesn’t matter how hard the odds are stacked against them, they’re the survey corps and the survey corps never surrenders!*

*Fine, whatever, for the stakes of the story Hange kills herself or something I guess.*

*No, they’ll receive NONE of the consequences of their actions whatsoever.* They betrayed the country but they can still go home because “diplomatic immunity” protects them (*just like how it works in real life*). They killed hundreds of their own soldiers but that will just never be revisited, they won’t be traumatized by that for years to come or anything. They doomed Paradise to certain destruction without a plan for survival but for some reason they get to live peacefully and grow old and die before that certain destruction arrives, because the universe would never let them be the victims of that. They allowed their morals to steer the direction of the fate of the entire world, then *didn’t fix it*, and then fucked off and lived lavish selfish lives and died before “not fixing it” could potentially become a problem for them, like it was for their immediate descendants. What a vile disaster.

So to wrap up this massive mess of a post, I guess I’ll just say that Devilman Crybaby’s ending is what I really wanted for AoT: a hollow, sobering “victory” for the ambitious genocidal maniac that’s truly a deserved crushing loss in a thin, poetic disguise. Love wins in the end, not because it outright defeats hatred, but because it leaves hatred to wallow in its own awfulness in a world of its own making.

Isayama gave us a shitty world full of people unwilling to change, *didn’t fix it*, and then said “I guess that’s just how it is on this bitch of an Earth lmao” because he either didn’t have the talent or otherwise didn’t have the **balls** to follow the chad Go Nagai’s lead. The end result is that Devilman Crybaby, a series where humanity succumbs to hatred and destroys itself, warns us that we should be more kind and understanding to one another, and that a little empathy can go a long way, while AoT, a series where humanity is saved from extinction by a group of traitors, spouts the nihilistic “philosophy” that humans just suck and there’s nothing your idiotic futile little slave self can do about it, and not even the universal concepts of karma or causality will stop the evil from flourishing.

Rewatching this series reminded me of my love for that franchise and kinda filled a decent chunk of the hole in me that AoT left behind.

So I started watching the anime when there was only 1 season. I loved it, back then I called it the ""game of thrones"" of animes (back when game of thrones was still good, I think the season airing back then was season 4 - tyrion trial and that shit, lovely stuff). 
 
 
Anyways, a long wait for season 2 and when it came I was glued and on the episode where they were stuck in the castle and ymir transformed I was like ""no way, I can't wait one more week, I can't even wait one more minute"" and so I decided to read the manga. 
 
 
In 2 days I was already caught up in the manga. The most recent chapter was pretty much episode 2 or 3 of season 4, so I already read about Marley vs Eldia and saw the warrior kids, but not much, although, compared to what the anime was showing (season 2 - mid, ymir revealed but not reiner nor bertholdt), it was a blast of knowledge.
 
 
I kept reading the manga for 1-2 years, started being active on the original subreddit, making theories, reading everything, trying to understand the attack titan power, being wtf with the owl referencing mikasa and armin, that first chapter name and trip at the beginning where it feels like a loop is restarting, etc. Good times.
 
 
Until Warhammer Titan appeared for the first time. That's when I decided to wait for the anime. This story was too good to read. I had to be pacient and get the full immersion.
 
 
 
Which brings us to today.
 
Somehow I did not have any spoiler, I was full ready for the grand finale. Not gonna lie, I was not expecting much just because I have a friend who has read the manga and he did not tell me if he liked it or nor so I deduced he did not because why the hell would he not tell me he liked it, if he did? It would create even more hype and make me enjoy more. Anyways I'm 'rumbling', let's go to the main point... 
   
  
 WTF was this finale?
  
Like, legit, what is [this](https://postimg.cc/Z0Z8WcXY)?
 
  
Is the moral of the story really to 'not be a simp'? Because that's the only way I can interpret it. And it wasn't even me. It was my girlfriend. She liked it but what does she know? She just saw it all for the first time last year and doesn't remember much as we watched it high but to be honest her interpretation is the only one that makes sense:
 
 - Ymir was the ultimate simp. When she saw Mikasa kill Eren she was like 'oh we can not be simps? Amazing' and the titan power vanishes.
 
 
 
[Serious]
 
 
Ok, not joking anymore, what the hell happened? 
From what I understood Eren said that the only one capable of reaching Ymir was Mikasa but he doesn't know what she did, only that she did and that he had to follow the same route because it was the best outcome. (You know, the outcome that made him kill 80% of the world population and that years later, from that slideshow, ended up not making a difference because Paradise was nuked anyways lol).
 
 - Is this the explanation of what we got? And when Armin has the same question as we do (thank you, my smart brother), Eren replies with 'Only Ymir knows'. (??????????????????????) This is our answer? Only Ymir knows? Did Eren really not have any plan and was just following memories because he somehow knew that Mikasa knew the way but did not why and just- I don't even know how to express myself. 
 
 
Next topic.
The origin of titans? Ok, so my theory was that Ymir didn't find her powers in the tree but already had them with her and in her struggle (almost dying), awoke her titans power for the first time, giving origin to our Attack on Titan events. 
 
With this in mind, and considering:
 - the name of the first chapter and the chapter of Ymir backstory
 - the fact that Falco had weird future memories at the beginning of season 4 (WHICH WAS NOT IN THE MANGA BTW, SO I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CREATOR ADDING EXTRA FORESHADOWING, which back then I thought it was a bit spoiler and when they showed us the attack titan power I figured 'oh, so Falco is gonna eat Eren, they are the only ones that have had memories without having any titan power - Eren at the tree, beginning of anime and Falco at the begining of season 4)
 - the information they gave us about 'what happens when a titan shifter dies without being eaten?' which apparently was the power was transfered to a newborn Eldian baby. This information was givne to us and never proven or useful so for sure it had to be important for something so...
 
I figured Falco would end up eating Eren (he had to get the attack titan) but there still had to be an end to the Eldian/world conflict so Falco would be the martyr (not Eren) by eating all shifters, possible euthanazing all Eldians, or killing them, idk I'm not a writer but then he would die carrying all titans and the power would go to a random baby but would that baby be? 
 
Historia's child. And what was my illumination? Being in a world of patriarchy,where the male pronoun is used as a general pronoun and where traditionally male children are wanted, we (and me included) always assumed Historia would have a boy. But imagine if it was a girl. What would you guys think Historia would name a girl child? Maybe her former best friend that she misses so much. Yep, Ymir.
 
 
And Ymir, the baby would inherit all powers from Falco, the world in a mess from rumbling, Ymir would end up being a slave, not knowing of her powers, one day struggling for her life she would awaken her powers and story would restart.
 
 
But no. The only explanation we get is that Ymir loved the king and therefore wanted to stay slave forever even after dying, like wtf? She's really the ultimate simp? And why did she like Eren then? Because he wanted freedom? Apparently she had it if she wanted since she chose to disappear after watching Mikasa decapitate Eren.
 
 
And what about the worm/origin of titans? Apparently it is its own entity and they just Naruto'd it? Aliens? Life itself? AND IT JUST DISAPPEARED.
 
I've literally just rewatched, Annie, Reiner and Pieck are grabbing the worm, then Mikasa kills Eren and we never see the worm again. Did it die? Was it spiritually attached to Ymir? The only thing we know is that Eldians lost their titan powers, all of them. But no explanation at all, like wtf, I can't even write correctly, I'm mixing stuff but you guys get it, you suffered this some years ago. You understand my struggle.
 
 
Also, apparently Ackerman are immune to becoming titans. Where did this information come from? When did they assume this? I mean, they had every opportunity to do so. All they had to do was show Levi drinking the wine with his troops so we would know he did not transform with them but they did not show it and now suddenly they drop us this information. What is this? Why are they so strong? What is their awakening? Nothing is explained.
 
 
Also, why are some mindless titans abnormals? The best explanation I can find is that they're commanded by future Eren to make stuff happen? But like, legit some are just trolling around, killing random people, that can't be it, so why are some titans Abnormals?
 
 
 On a final note, how did Mikasa kill Eren? She always defended him, always, it even became kinda plot relevant with the whole Eren speech about Ackerman just doing what they're told when he beat up Armin.  She would never cut his head just like that, in a second, no way. The only way this makes sense is if the moral of the story is 'you can't be a simp', which again, lol.
 
 
 And, just so I'm not labeled as a hater, I can show *some* positivity. Eren meeting Armin, Mikasa and the others and taking away their memories until he's dead caught me by surprise and was actually a cool twist but I don't think I even understood it correctly, I might need some help clarifying some shit:
 
 - Chronogically speaking, when was he on the lover's retire with Mikasa? Was that after they did that sneaky recon mission on Liberio where Eren disappeared at the end only to show up to kill Warhammer? 
 

 - What was that conversation between young Eren and young Armin? Did Founding/Royal titan Eren go to a memory of young Eren and Armin and explain them what was gonna happen? Did young Eren already know? He did not, he only found out shit after touching Historia necklace so I really cannot understand how that conversation happened. Is that in the paths? Where everything is happening at the same time? But still, how were they young and with this knowledge?
 
 
 
Yeah, I think this was worse than Game Of thrones. I'm just not more angry because it's not the first time this happens. Oh well.. Thank you for reading, apparently you're the cool sub now, from what I gathered in these last hours of non stop reading about this shit finale.

(My personal theory is that Tybur family had a dispute and some of them decided to stay behind with their people and some betrayed them, took the King's offer and became the rulers of Marley)

And then there's aruani, which means 

\*Karl Frtiz being the devil was a lie---Eren being the devil became a reality

I don't think I have to explain this part...

Parent-child relationship takes a lot of focus in this story. They have a special place in this story because they were born to these folks. Reiner's foundation of his goals and dreams come from Karina, Eren's  entire story is tied to Grisha, Historia is a royal-blood, Mikasa is an Ackerman AND a special clan of Orientals. It only makes sense that Armin's parents or grandfather will have an important role to play...

But here's the most important part which makes the story far more complicated than before and that's Ymir.

Ymir is not only the person who literally started this story, but is also the one who controls the reality, in other words this entire story is her elaborate plan of 2000 years to be free in the end. 

But...

""A girl has a dream, she dreams of a word free of curses and fate""

I think Ymir's goals extend more than just herself...

And the one who is most likely the reverse of Ymir is Mikasa...

I have already made a post on the contrast of Mikasa's ED and Ymir's backstory... :

[Post about the Freedom insignia, Mikasa and Ymir](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/ky35wg/the_mystery_of_that_little_girl_from_season_3/)

combined with the fact that both their songs were released at the same time...

...but I still don't know how it will play out in the story.

One possible possible route I can see is this-

This entire sequence is supposed to be from Grisha's POV except the frame below. 

[Eren eats his father](https://preview.redd.it/l76zltql4bc61.jpg?width=1793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=142a4bdd7d5c0ec885651f3b2583b8da2ab8210c)

And Isayama in the exhibition said he drew this scene while keeping in focus  along running mystery (which still hasn't been revealed yet). This is also the one thing which separates them from the rest of humanity, the 'ability to turn into a titan'.

And this was also the first revelation of this story, ""Eren can turn into titan.""

Then, 'everyone' can become a titan....until we find out that, no...only this specific group of people can turn into titan.

So,

\*What happens when an Ackerman injects a titan tho...

 \*Who is going to be the last person who turns into a titan...

\-The Ackermann can turn into titan because they are subjects of Ymir 

\-They don't turn into titan because they are bi-products of titan-science.

These are all head-canons btw, literally nobody knows what exactly will happen if Levi or Mikasa inject themselves with titan-serum.

This has been brought up only 2 times now.

But the problem is did Levi even have it ?

(2nd time)

But I have a theory regarding the memory shards in chapter 130.

(If it's too long to read just control + F for the TL;DR section)

P.s (If you have any criticisms or thoughts please comment down below)

P.s.s (Can't wait for this to be debunked in a few days)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjng5u5m8v861.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3f77f51c479657992969247aa0686b576c16956

Now I was just reading through the manga for the 100th time and I noticed something peculiar about this page. Everything we see in these shards are memories from Eren's future, the future meaning after he kisses Historia's hand in chapter 90 hence the ""it's all still ahead of us"".....that is except for one. 

The only memory shard that we know to be from the past is Bertholdt's, which is from him exiting thehe power colossal titan after breaking down the gate of Shiganshina district. To make things more perplexing, this memory seems to be the odd one out of memories that includes people Eren is fond of or close to whether it be family: Zeke Grisha, his grandad(Mikasa?). Or close friends (The 104th....yes even Floche). The only other ones that don't fall into this group are the birds Pieck and Falco. The birds can be explained through the obvious symbol of freedom that is prevalent in the series, Pieck due this being the moment where she threatens his life making it rather important in the overall scheme of things. The Falco shard is an interesting one on its own, in relation to the Eren is the Bird theories that most of you have probably already heard so I won't repeat it here; however this is still important to Eren as Falco is one of the few boys, heck few people period he met over the seas that treated him kindly. So much that he wished him a long life and motioned for Zeke to stop when he was about to scream likely because of Falco being one of the people who he knew drank the wine.

&#x200B;

So with that out of the way, it leaves us to wonder why Bert is in the mix here. No offense to him, but when it comes to Eren's favorites he's nowhere near the top of the list. That last time Eren mentioned Bertholdt it was in 112 when he accused Armin of being controlled by the enemy and being absolutely worthless. At least with Reiner we saw a mending of sorts between Eren and him, but Eren has not shown a single pity point towards Bertholdt. So why is he in his memories, more specifically his FUTURE memories?

Well let's take a look at powers of the Attack Titan again as stated by Grisha

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z06y4cn5mv861.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=514aa8d87347b002a541b7e800967a7031e39ef5

The Attack Titan can see the future! But is it really that simple? If that was the case then why didn't Eren just ""see"" the Rumbling all the way back when Grisha gave him the AT years ago? 

The specifics of the ability rely in the past successors of the Attack Titan being able to look into the memories of their future successors i.e Grisha and Eren.

&#x200B;

[Grisha Explains what the future holds](https://preview.redd.it/g5uzm3mwnv861.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=4011df2e54f647d93abc3845b403c180bc7bb245)

&#x200B;

Now there is uncertainty as to whether the future successor can send memories backwards in time, or if it something the present inheritor has to look actively forward for or passively receives. Regardless of whether there is a passive element and if the past inheritors can reach into the future, it is confirmed within the story that at least Eren can send memories backwards for people to receive in the past. We see this with Grisha multiple times when he's surprised to see Zeke or to see from Eren's POV.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Grisha surprised to see Zeke and explains it away as a dream](https://preview.redd.it/t5k1c1ruov861.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=bedd3056acfe70d007f75e7b02750d6d5ef2dd72)

[Knows Eren is looking Behind Him](https://preview.redd.it/xptjukahov861.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90dd2a61ca367c2bca9a50c5d1726be72f2514)

&#x200B;

[Surprised to suddenly see him when he wasn't before](https://preview.redd.it/b5rryzpkov861.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d217ba5b640fc9b2d932b01cf95ab9822c011fc)

&#x200B;

These instances show that Grisha was not looking purposefully into the future at these points in times, he is suddenly hit with a memory from the future by Eren. Which leaves the possibility of a passive recollection or an active sending from Eren to the past. I personally don't care whether the passive ability is true or not, it might be due to Eren's surprise when Grisha first sees Zeke. But we know the active ability has to be true because of what Grisha says in the next panel.

&#x200B;

[Grisha amiss jumbled memories](https://preview.redd.it/m036dw5gpv861.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=fca6f0b3f0a3134782f0e170c9978389a33ca53c)

Grisha isn't seeing everything, he's only being shown some things by Eren. Which means Eren is choosing what is being sent into the past and what isn't, an active ability under his control, which Zeke later explains is him manipulating Grisha into doing what he wants by controlling what he knows about the future.

&#x200B;

[Zeke's Big Brain Moment](https://preview.redd.it/k81ss4svpv861.png?width=2037&format=png&auto=webp&s=cefeda388fb1d823e25f02dec8bd94dbaa96051d)

I guess I could have just shown the last image to prove my point much quicker, but I wanted to cover all my bases. If you made this far into the theory here is treat: [https://external-preview.redd.it/\_yMyuRmwMWmcFaOsxJEUt7RtOfgtEkMSRu2VOtFEnN8.jpg?auto=webp&s=489ba9d4f46a7c28767fd9f49f1123344fdb90e4](https://external-preview.redd.it/_yMyuRmwMWmcFaOsxJEUt7RtOfgtEkMSRu2VOtFEnN8.jpg?auto=webp&s=489ba9d4f46a7c28767fd9f49f1123344fdb90e4)

It's a little graphic that helps explain how Grisha see Zeke and knows Eren is there when they aren't really there. (While I disagree with some things said I agree completely with the section explaining Grisha's perception of things)

&#x200B;

With that out of the way that brings me to the ""So What"" section. ""So what if he can send memories into the past? What does that have to do with the memory shard?""

Well my dear reader it all hinges upon this one panel

&#x200B;

[Poor Grisha](https://preview.redd.it/07ykrxzarv861.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=246f0cec9a6623911eadb6ab52440f75aa469d2a)

Eren showed Grisha ""what's next"" what he calls ""that scenery""

&#x200B;

[Eren X Freedom](https://preview.redd.it/qhuex903uv861.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ba0656a27e77c96f8f341f4bc21998f11de09b6)

I think we can all agree that the scenery is related to the rumbling, my personal bets are on this picture from 131 and all the blood and gore surrounding. Hence Grisha's description of ghastly

&#x200B;

[The lovely view from your bone carriage](https://preview.redd.it/s9xnzuabuv861.png?width=2133&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c1cc6bfa5b569e72514ab8be58caa3403f7247)

&#x200B;

But we know that the rumbling doesn't happen until the tail end of 122 up until where the manga is now at 135. 

So Eren couldn't have sent this memory until Zeke lost control of Ymir. Ergo, Eren is able to send memories to Grisha regardless of whether Zeke is there or not. 

And now with Ymir on his side, he has the Coordinate, where all paths converge to his full use. He isn't just limited to previous Attack Titan users anymore. He has ALL ELDIANS IN HISTORY\* he can use his abilities to take advantage of.

(Technically Subjects of Ymir, but you know what I mean)

Which leads us finally to the conclusion.

(\*\*TL;DR Section\*\*)

  
Eren used the power of the Founding and Attack Titan to manipulate the smiling titan in the past to go on the course of events that would lead her to eat Carla, to motivate Eren to kill all that titans, and eat Hannes, to allow for Eren to figure out about the coordinate. This is why the memory of Bert is there, because that is Eren in the future controlling Dina(either literally or through memories) to ignore Bertholdt.

Possibly even intervening in the events of ch.50(S2EP12) to save everyone since realistically Eren should not have been able to control the titans due to the established rule of royal blood being necessary(until Eren frees Ymir)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are three Premises to this theory that lead me to this conclusion

1. Eren can and has sent memories to the past via the Attack Titan
2. Eren with the Founding Titan has been connected to all other Eldians in Space and Time through paths
3. The shenanigans with the Smiling Titan, Carla and Hannes' deaths and Eren using the Coordinate power in ch.50 making no sense without some ulterior explanation.

I've explained the first two premises in depth and will quickly explain the last point.

This series has been going on for 10+ years now and we still don't know very much about how titans work, what abnormals are or what is the urge that leads them to eat humans to begin with. A common fan theory is that titans go around eating people in hopes of eating a shifter, so that they may return to being human like Ymir did after eating Marcel.

I like this theory, it makes sense in context of the series and has no real contradictions within the story or actions of titans in the series so far. So it makes me wonder why the Smiling Titan, Dina Fritz, when laid with the per

Why would she not eat him? Even if one tried to argue that pure titans are too stupid to know which titans are shifters, this titan knows that Bert just came out of that titan.

&#x200B;

[This was also animated, while they chose to cut nearly everything else](https://preview.redd.it/8cqoexxewv861.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=b015cfa78bfd49f1d303ff3fb6cb30f8a3d5f552)

And we do know that titans can tell shifter titans differently from pure titans. This is why Rico Mitabi and co. tell the soldiers to defend Eren when he's carrying the rock to block the gate

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/day94twugv861.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae2bb39ee9ee41486a3cd6c04d366f9587daa4bc

Why would they need to do that if Eren is just seemingly a titan and titans don't attack other titans? When Eren first showed up a titan aims to attack him before he even does anything to him and this repeats over multiple times. There is an inner acknowledgement of possible titan shifters which leads them to attack them in hopes of eating the person inside.

&#x200B;

So why doesn't Dina eat Bertholdt? Well you already know my answer, but I suspect some will chalk it down to her being an abnormal. Personally I see this as a cop-out as we still do not know anything about abnormals, and the last one explicitly mentioned was Rod Reiss. What made him an abnormal? Maybe the theory is that abnormals come from the royal family or misadminstered titan spinal fluid. The former would certainly explain why Rod and Dina became abnormals, but plotholes aside revolving around titan succession in the walls, if DIna is simply an abnormal, then how does she always end up near Eren? 

&#x200B;

First with Carla and then with Hannes, this all seems very convenient....TOO convenient. If my previous arguments do not favor you then I have one more question for you.

&#x200B;

How was Eren able to use the power of the Founder, if Ymir only listens to royal blood in ch.50/S2E12? Even ignoring Eren and Dina not being sent to paths as they should be like Zeke and Eren were when they tried to use the power of the founding titan by touching, Dina is the only one who could have asked Ymir to do something in that situation. Which leaves us with a very plothole heavy road for us to drive through. Even laying all of it on Dina saving Eren there, how is that Eren was able to command the titans to attack Bert and Reiner even when he wasn't touching Dina? This seems almost unsalvageable based on what we know about how paths works in chapter 120-122.

&#x200B;

Unless that is Eren orchestrated all these events surrounding Dina so that he could self his younger self with the double edged dark sword of rage and anger with the death of his mother, and allow himself to find out about the truth of the coordinate in S2 with the death of Hannes.

&#x200B;

I think that's enough for now, but just as a passing thought, it is weird how Carla and Hannes' deaths are foreshadowed all the way back in episode 1 with Eren's memories. Especially when he wasn't even a shifter then....

Since Volume 21, these previews have taken the form of the **'Attack on School Castes' Alternate Universe**. It depicts the characters living a 'normal life' in a 21st century high school; you can read them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/k9mvt2/isayama_and_his_fake_previewsi_want_mooore/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

However, many may be unaware that a separate Drama CD exists for this alternate universe. It includes 4 episodes and all VA's are present. It was also explicitly **supervised by Isayama himself**. You can read them [here](https://kiryuun-blog.tumblr.com/translations?fbclid=IwAR1qtYPZ9YHAELxLi7SWcsuJg4Ohx5gBiyf5lGvIN1ohAjTUO_sra09tWO0), or listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vl-cBEv3iI).

As such, here are some of the most salient pieces of dialogue I noticed from the Drama CD episodes:

*(Note: E= Eren, M=Mikasa, A= Armin, J= Jean, H= Historia, R=Reiner, Er= Erwin etc).*

# The characters live in a 'world of peace,' where the titan powers are a thing of the past.

In the Drama CD, we see that Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Historia and Reiner are in detention with Mr Smith (Erwin). Erwin is teaching them about the history of the titans:

[Erwin mentions that they are now living in a peaceful world. Highlights the importance that if this wasn't the case, 'anyone could be eaten by a titan.' A comedic nod to the current world the characters live in.](https://preview.redd.it/zt6kowcfqvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b92c00a4c7900f3e43bc3707caf52dae0bb0ddc1)

[Erwin then mentions that he wants to teach his students about 'humanity's mistakes' \(in reference to the history of the titans\).](https://preview.redd.it/orru70nlqvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06110c542d0c4e224a1da0024874260e0a788e87)

[The students then note down the chronological order of events \(eg. Year 845, fall of Wall Maria\). It's interesting to hear Historia say 'What's the use of knowing that?' It really hones in that this truly is a world of peace. ](https://preview.redd.it/oh6oq5ttqvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56a8ddb32ac2e47b35e32e8d961e944083d43545)

It also seems that many of the character's previous issues/traumas are no longer present in this universe:

[It is mentioned that Historia is 'loved by kind parents,' \(a definite contrast to her upbringing in the current AOT universe\). ](https://preview.redd.it/qnbp1tbervp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3dc2ca3c2fa38d1e31e32653e02abd227b1c7de3)

[It is also mentioned that Reiner is no longer miserable, and has a 'bright future.' ](https://preview.redd.it/7hepqhiirvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3176803f495cfa6bcdf37cddafbb9dc619e4539)

# Armin lapses into narrator mode

Considering that Armin is the narrator in the anime (both sub and dub), many have speculated that this hints to Armin's importance in the story. This notion is also hinted at in the Drama CD:

https://preview.redd.it/90twq4tyrvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76df491aec25bd47d7eab767d613aca5960a0518

# Mikasa's commentary is very cryptic...

In this AU, Mikasa is dubbed as a 'goth' and appears to have an interest in all things supernatural (many of which link strongly to the current AOT world). Such examples include:

* Mikasa is seen drawing 'Baphomet,' a devil with a goat's head. We have seen this before already...

[Mikasa is seen drawing Baphomet; a devil with a goat's head.](https://preview.redd.it/98fqsup4tvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4586cf157d2c94ce9602f94031ddb3464e02ab9)

[A devil with a goat's head is also how the 'devil' in the AOT universe is depicted. ](https://preview.redd.it/5kgpsqldtvp61.jpg?width=586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acbf9fb5f87023926d5adf45279ab26c8563c7cf)

* Mikasa also mentions the consequences of desiring destruction. Not only is this a prominent theme in AOT, but interestingly, the Eren in the School Castes AU fake previews is seen desiring destruction in a similar fashion:

[Mikasa mentions desiring destruction and said consequences.](https://preview.redd.it/mdd91865uvp61.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eead0152ef6a4e829069053f58aee925849a360)

# There are strong hints of 'another world.'

There are multiple hints in the Drama CD that there is 'another world' to the one they are currently living in (21st century). Perhaps this suggests that these two universes are not separated, but actually connected.

* Here, Mikasa suggests that Eren comes from a 'different world.'

https://preview.redd.it/610pjehcvvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cba19f5085e06f2536738d7027691be2adc5015

* It was also shown that Eren fell through the roof (lol). Mikasa then mentions that the ceiling (**above**) is like an 'open door to **hell**.' I can't help but think of the Chapter 122 text in the main story that suggested 'another world' that exists **underneath.** So perhaps, AOT universe: *above*, School Castes Universe: *below*. And let's not forget that in the latest manga chapter, Armin referred to the AOT universe as '**hell**.'

[The ceiling \(above\) is like an 'open door to Hell' ](https://preview.redd.it/d8d9wh0lvvp61.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4bf9d41cfef99248d63d77a7b2ff27872816e91)

Now I know what you might be thinking; *'so what? These are just fun previews at the end of the manga, they mean nothing!*' However, not only was a [memory shard](https://imgur.com/9oeAEN1) of the School Castes AU characters seen in Chapter 120 of the manga, but Isayama also [mentioned](https://www.snknews.com/post/186889347382/2525-kawakubo-the-initial-draft-isayama-sensei?fbclid=IwAR2gS0g8BIlC6ZFUCktP9F5ysqSZllzbCgqL5HIRT7VHrnJ8HKuZPcUKJ_k) (at the AOT **ending** exhibition) a desire to link this School Castes AU to the main story.

Knowing this information, I already devised (the controversial) [Alternate Universe Ending Theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/ldfsg3/the_alternate_universe_ending_theory_a_complete/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that suggests that Chapter 139 will conclude with these two universes connecting together. This theory is strengthened by the fact that Isayama has mentioned on multiple occasions that the ending of AOT is inspired by Muv Luv Alternative; >!a story about a boy who visits an alternate universe with giant aliens, and at the very end, travels back to his original universe, where he 'wakes up' from a 'long dream,' and resumes attending high school as a normal boy in the 21st century. !<

And of course, you are free to believe/create/disagree with any theory you see about the ending of Attack on Titan. In fact, I can already see the comments; saying this ending sucks, poor writing, prefer AnR, prefer Chad Eren who destroys everything etc. But to be frank, that's not my problem; this is not my story. I am just presenting to you various pieces of evidence from a variety of sources to offer a differing perspective. And whether you like it or not, considering the staggering amount of ending theories that involve time-fuckery and characters 'waking up', there's just no denying that an AU ending is indeed in the realm of possibility.",False,False,titanfolk,"For those unaware, an AOT School Castes AU Drama CD was released.

There have been many different theories about what will the ending be, including the one with Eren controlling the rumbling with the War Hammer titan and will restart it after touching Historia's baby. Some people agreed, some didn't.

Now I want to start with saying that I'm a sucker for Eren and copium first, and I actually hope this theory will come true, but I wanted to ask to my pro-allience fellows about what they think the ending will gonna be.

To me, the situation is like this: There've been a race called Eldians which can turn into titans and caused catastrophes in the past, and been sealed in an island because of the those past events, but then one of them came and tried to destroy the world, which he partly succeeded, and then again from the same race came a group who didn't support the Rumbling and saved the world.

Now, if you try to think from the perspective of the people who survived, I would say these guys are not a saviour or something. One of them was the cause in the first place and them stopping Eren doesn't mean anything. Also, this brings another point: Even though, collectively, they don't want genocide, 1 guy who thinks otherwise can come and destroy the world. I would say just nuke em all, wipe em out, and make sure a power like that doesn't exist in the world.

Now, you might say that it's cruel or something, but I feel like from what I've seen in all those episodes and chapters, everybody is trying to survive in this world, they are fighting for their lives every second. All of the remaining people on earth trying to secure their futures is perfectly sensible. With all of this I don't believe that they are gonna go and say ""Wow, look at all the Eldians, they weren't actually bad. Maybe we should try to understand each other."" And this would be the reason I would be so disappointed if it ends like this, because it's simply too contradictory and naive to the everything that happened and told so far in the AOT world.

So, I wanted to ask you, again: What do you think could be a possible ending apart from Eren restarting the rumbling, or Eren being killed and Eldia getting nuked?

&#x200B;

Like the title suggests, in this post I will try to analyze in-depth all the mythological elements (MAINLY but not only from [Norse/North Germanic mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology)) and the parallels to real historical events I think Isayama drew ispiration from in order to plot his story. I will also offer my comprehensive theory on how the manga will end, based mostly on what we've seen so far. **I can't stress enough that this is MY OPINION on the matter and I NEVER pretended, pretend or will pretend otherwise.**

&#x200B;

**I will start by immediately making clear that I think the Rumbling will be stopped by the Alliance, that peace between Eldia and the rest of the world (including Marley) WILL, EVENTUALLY, be achieved and that, while I can't guarantee for Paradis as it currently stands, Eldians will still exists as a nation/ethnic group by the end of it, and NOT be exterminated.**

**If you fundamentally disagree with this view and CANNOT reconcile with it no matter what arguments I bring fort and will thusly refute an ending of this kind, no matter how well Isayama may explain or execute it, I suggest you to not even bother with this post and to stop reading it altogether right now.** The others may continue instead.

After this disclaimer, I may begin by stating the obvious: **Attack on Titan** has a ""**Germanic**"" setting and is HEAVILY inspired by [pre-Christian Germanic/Nordic mythos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_mythology) and beliefs. This is especially evident from the anime (but also from the manga, except perhaps not from the very first chapters) since the very beginning. Most of the characters have Scandinavian, German or English names (with few notable exceptions such as Mikasa, which is Japanese; Eren, which is Turkish; and a few other names that are Slavic in nature), whether they be of pagan or Christian origins. *(If any of you is interested about this, I can further elaborate about the origins of the names of the characters in one of the next parts of this post. You'll have to ask in the comments for that, though.)*

[ Above is a view of Lake Geroldsee in the city of Gerold, near the Bavarian Alps; while below is a non-specified location, somewhere outside the Walls, in the AoT anime.](https://preview.redd.it/hqsq2jyket261.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=538267b26d6c88c4457efeee6c9b2ca1e70dd323)

At the beginning of the manga, the setting resembles an anachronistic Central European nation, which some back then (in 2013) even commented that it seemed to be set in the ""Middle Ages"". I disagreed with this last statement, since I thought it more closely resembled European nations from the 17th/18th centuries, although with technology obviously out of place.

[  Above is \\""The Forest of Giant Trees\\"" as seen in Season 1 of the AoT anime; while below is a photo of the Black Forest, in Baden-Württemberg, southwest Germany.](https://preview.redd.it/lru3xg74ft261.jpg?width=978&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fc70a58aaf8848ff444ac7b0c23d6a68afedd7a)

By watching the first season of the anime, it's rather evident that the real world nation from which Isayama drew the MOST ispiration is Germany, especially the [German Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Confederation) (precursor to the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire) of [Otto von Bismarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck)) formed in the 19th century after the defeat of Napoleon, with SOME elements taken from [other Germanic nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic-speaking_Europe) in the same time period, especially Great Britain and the Netherlands.

This is clear by the **clothes** (out of the [1800s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_century), with the exception perhaps of the brown military jackets, and of the hoodies some characters like Annie wear in the OVA, which appear much more modern (although with the justification of Annie coming from an outside nation that is much more advanced, for the latter)), **buildings** (Shiganshina's style closely resembles [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria), especially the city of [Nördlingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%B6rdlingen), weapons ([cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon#18th_and_19th_centuries) and [muzzleloader firearms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzleloader), also [muskets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket), the EXCEPTION being 3DMG, which I will talk about in a minute) and by other elements outside the story, such as the many songs in German language made specifically for the anime's soundtrack and credits (both in openings and endings). Some examples of this songs are: **Guren no Yumiya**, **Akatsuki no Requiem** and **Jiyuu no Tsubasa** by *Linked Horizon* and **Vogel im Käfig** by *Cyua* and *Hiroyuki Sawano* (I'm sure I missed some but now you get the gist of it). If you want to read more about it:  ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_on\_Titan\_(TV\_series)#Music)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan_(TV_series)#Music))

Like I said though, the setting is slightly anachronistic, because while the technology such as firearms and cannons may make sense, the 3-Dimensional Maneuver Gear (essentially steam powered jetpacks and grappling hooks) does not. It surely couldn't be created with 19th century technology and using it would break the spinal column of any potential human wearer (although we only saw Eldians using it and it could be ""[handwaved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving#In_literary_criticism)"" away by saying that only then are durable enough, even in human form, to use it). (**And as the post of another user a while ago mentioned, it's very strange that the royal government would ban cylinder firearms but allow the development of proto-jetpacks, but I assume Isayama came up with the idea of 3DMG BEFORE he came up with the goverment conspiracy plot point.**)

Now that I've set the stage, let's talk about the **politics and lore** of the manga. It apparently all began roughly 2000 years before the current events, in a place that in all likelihood was either Paradis Island or the north of the Marleyan continent. The setting , despite taking place in the geographical equivalent of either our island of Madagascar ([which incidentally is very interesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_Plan)) or the southern part of the African continent, more closely resembles that of Scandinavia, roughly during the [Roman Iron Age period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology_of_Northern_Europe#Roman_Iron_Age) (1–400 CE/AD). We are shown the primitive ""Eldian tribe"" as what appears to be a [Norse tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsemen) right out of the [""Vikings"" TV show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings_(2013_TV_series)). **I'm not an historian specialized in the field (feel free to correct me if you are and I'm wrong)** but I assume the weapons, clothes, general customs and utensils are portrayed at least with a modicum of historical accuracy. I believe Isayama chooses to portray this simplified version of history without focusing on other background details because the historical similarities are for him a ""means to an end"" to tell his **(political and politicized)** story.

[ Above is a promotional picture for Season 2 of the \\""Vikings\\"" TV series; while below: a panel from chapter 122 of the AoT manga. ](https://preview.redd.it/fv1fozfhjt261.jpg?width=3136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=931e902064d4006a479af90ba7bcab499f57ccaa)

We see Eldia being a brutal, warlike, expansionist tribal entity that conquers and assimilates neighbouring tribes (like Ymir's one), usually enslaving their population (or at least the female and prepubescent part of it, perhaps the adult male members are simply exterminated). Ymir is thus enslaved and she becomes what could best be described as a [""thrall""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrall) (basically a serf during the [Viking Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_Age), and the lowest of of the three-tiered social order of the [Germanic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Germanic_peoples), notable for being considered purely property that could be bought and sold, with no special provision by law ([the early Germanic law codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Germanic_law) that is). In essence, people with no rights, born in bondage (Ymir's case, most likely) or **serfdom** and that could not aspire to anything more in life except serving their masters (who also were the only ones who could guarantee some form of protection, by law).

[  Side by side: On the left a panel from chapter 122 of the AoT manga, pictured is the Eldians ransacking Ymir's village.

Notice that they are supposed to be from two VERY different time periods SEPARATED BY CENTURIES \(the Scandinavian Iron Age on the left and the post-Migration Period \\""Viking Age\\"" on the right\), but for the sake of simplicity they are portrayed very similarly.](https://preview.redd.it/rqbggd4akt261.jpg?width=3496&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0de3abcc2098de84779aed761efe64e27f2c5a71)

You know the story: the pigs, likely one of the few sources of meat, either escape or are set free by someone, and to avoid collective punishment, the other thralls lay all the blame on Ymir's shoulders. King Fritz thus mockingly ""sets her free"" by giving her a head start (after having injured her with arrows and likely carved out one of her eyes, that is), before having her chasen down in a forest by horseback riders and hunting dogs, with the intent to kill her.

Here we see Ymir stumbling upon a very large tree ([likely a sequoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoiadendron_giganteum)), this manga's version of the mythical [Yggdrasil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil), with a hole that leads to a cavity at its base. As you know, Ymir falls down headfirst into a pool of water and, as she drifts further and further down, she comes in contact with this strange creature (probably based on the real life [Cambrian worm Hallucigenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucigenia)), this manga's version of the mythical [Nidhogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%AD%C3%B0h%C3%B6ggr), which attaches to her and transform her into the very first Titan.

We are not shown what happens immediately after, but it's implied that King Fritz manipulated Ymir (who, being a slave/thrall since infancy, could not conceive of a better life for herself) into doing his bidding and using her Titan powers to *""build roads, cultivate the wastelands and make bridges between the mountains""*, that is to say, to make the primitive Eldia into one of the most prosperous civilizations and to allow them to **easily conquer their enemies, as seen with the Marleyans.**

[ The ancient, tribal King Fritz commands Ymir to use her newfound Titan power to \\""destroy the accursed Marleyans\\"". This panel is taken from chapter 122 of the AoT manga ](https://preview.redd.it/gqmfwx1rlt261.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22149e64182e17de06997e5ab5d93dd00d559ee3)

Which brings me to the Marley. In the flashback taking place ""2000 years ago"", the Marleyans are represented as [Roman legionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionary) taken straight from the early [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire), led by what seems to be a [Centurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centurion) (?); which doesn't make a whole lot of sense considering [Roman legions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_legion) were usually formed by 10 [cohorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)), each of which was formed by four [maniples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniple_(military_unit)) (of 120 legionaries each), a maniple being itself made up of two [centuriae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centuria) (of 80 legionaries each) (a Centurion was the leader of each centuria). My point being that a single Centurion leads too many soldiers in chapter 122 of the manga, but I'm digressing.

https://preview.redd.it/6jr1sv5kmt261.jpg?width=2320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=803b1aae09a7b983116e8d414db751c22e48f74b

**Side by side: On the left, Marleyans absolutely not standing a chance against Ymir Fritz's new Titan powers. Taken from chapter 122 of the AoT manga. On the right: A** [galea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galea_(helmet)) **(**[of the Imperial Gallic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_helmet#Imperial_Gallic)**), the helmet worn by the Roman legionary, A transversal** [crest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_(heraldry))**, like that of the helmet in the right picture, USUALLY indicates the rank of Centurion, while a longitudinal crest, like that worn by the Marleyan in the left picture, USUALLY is reserved for someone of a lower rank, such as normal members of a centuria.**

Isayama clearly chose to use the Imperial Romans as they're known in popular culture to represent Marley,to give historical weight to the long-standing enmity between Eldia and Marley. Germanic tribes were far from being the only threat (or even the main one, initially) to the Roman Empire, but eventually, by the end of Rome's imperial period, they became one of the leading causes for [the collapse of the empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire).

[ The Roman Empire and its army, as usually pictured in the collective imagination, and as often presented in many American movies and TV shows ](https://preview.redd.it/tkb4jpe4nt261.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2843f1ec20f000ceec6e4601f31facd90e9f29a)

Here's another point I want to bring to your attention though: after Ymir dies (**by refusing to heal herself** with her Titan powers, **hoping to escape her life of slavery in death**), we see Fritz feeding her body to his and Ymir's three daughters (**Maria, Rose and Sheena/Sina**) and after that, we are TOLD by narration that Fritz ordered the three girls to keep having children, as to ""**not let Ymir's blood die out**"", to have said children eat the their spines and then to have their own spines eaten in turn by their descendats, to pass on the Titan powers. The final phrase uttered by the King on his deathbed is ""**Eldia shall rule this world with its Titans. And they shall continue to reign forever. Forever, so long as our world knows no end**"". We see a panel of eight of the Nine Titans (**the Founding Titan** is surely the one missing) terrorizing people (**probably Marleyans**) to accompany this phrase.

[  Two consecutive panels from chapter 122 of the AoT manga, detailing the ancient King Fritz's final command to his and Ymir's daughters](https://preview.redd.it/y7xoj4m6pt261.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca7030202218dbc51953719767ca43d0bba18bfb)

Now, to me this clearly illustrates that Ymir's story marks **the START of a (roughly) two thousands-years long domination of Eldia over Marley and eventually over the entire world**. We are given very little information and details about this, Isayama intentionally leaves his world building very vague, so I can only make assumptions and not absolute statements, as Isayama could choose to rectify or even retcon part of Eldia's past in a future chapter. I will use the ""**Attack on Titan Wiki**"" ([https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline)) as a source but I will also mention the chapters of the manga it uses as reference for its (the wiki's) breakdown of the timeline of events in AoT's world.

**(""B1"" stands for before the AoT world's ""year zero"" (845 years before the year in which chapter 1 takes place), whichever that might be, same as we divide our real world timeline in Before Christ (B.C.) and Anno Domini (A.D.))** (about that: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno\_Domini#CE\_and\_BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini#CE_and_BCE))

**NOTE: I will not post any image to accompany the timeline of events because it would break the flow of the text and make reading comprehension even harder than it already is.**

&#x200B;

**1003 B1** \- Ymir, hunted down by Eldian tribesmen for her crime of freeing the tribe's pigs, comes in contact with the spine-like creature and transforms into the first (the original Founder) Titan. **(chapter 122)**

**c. 995 B1** \- The king of the Eldian tribe, pleased with Ymir's power and accomplishments, takes her to bear his children and starts using her in warfare against the enemy population of Marley. **(chapter 122)**

**990 B1** \- Ymir Fritz defends her king from an assassination attempt at the hands of a Marleyan soldier, choosing to succumb to death from her wound. The king of Eldia feeds Ymir Fritz's corpse to his daughters Maria, Rose, and Sina, who inherit Ymir's power of the Titans.

Ymir's consciousness survives in the paths, a metaphysical timeless space where she starts creating the bodies of Titans and carrying out the commands of the living royal family through the Founding Titan. **(chapter 122)**

**Unspecified** \- Ymir's daughters bestow their power of the Titans unto their grandchildren, leading to the eventual creation of the Nine Titans. **(ch. 122)** The Founding Titan remains with the Fritz family while the eight remaining Titans are inherited by lesser Eldian families subservient to the Founding Titan and the royal bloodline. **(ch. 86)** Those who inherit the power of the Titans are destined to die after 13 years as Ymir did due to a phenomenon called the ""Curse of Ymir."" **(ch. 88)**

The Nine Titans continue to wage war against the nation of Marley, taking control of the continent and gradually transforming the Eldian tribe into the Eldian Empire. **(ch. 86)** Eldia conquers countless other civilizations as well using Pure Titans as cheap weapons of mass destruction **(ch.89)** This results in massive casualties and entire cultures being wiped out. **(ch. 99)**

Eventually, in-fighting breaks out between the various Eldian families for control over the eight Titans, but the Fritz family, using the power of the Founding Titan, maintains balance. **(ch. 86)**

The Ackerman clan, an Eldian bloodline resulted from the Eldian Empire's fiddling with the Subjects of Ymir **(ch. 112)**, becomes the sword and shield of the royal family, remaining close to Eldia's king for generations. **(ch. 65)**

**(These events are extrapolated by, Grandpa Ackerman's conversation (in a flashback) with Kenny during the latter's serial killer days in chapter 65, Grandpa Yeager's narration to Grisha and Grisha' reading of the documents that the Owl (Eren Kruger) sent him to the Restorationists in chapter 86; Kruger's explanation of his mission to Grisha (in a flashback) in chapter 88; a military meeting between Queen Historia, Darius Zackly, the leaders of the other branches of the military, Hange and Levi's squad in chapter 89; and Willy Tybur's speech before the world diplomats gathered in Liberio in chapter 99.)**

**c. 370 B1** \- Allegedly, Eldia wages war against Marley through Titan assaults at the ""Fall of Lago"", the ""Devastation of Monte"", and the ""Ravaging of Valle"", resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Marleyans. **(from Grandpa Yeager's narration to Zeke in chapter 114)**

**c. 240** \- An epidemic leads to a significant drop in the worldwide population. With the power of the Founding Titan, the King of Eldia alters the biology of the Subjects of Ymir to give them immunity, and no Subject of Ymir dies to the epidemic **(from Tom Ksaver's conversation with Zeke in chapter 114)**

**Unknown** \- Eldia becomes allies with Hizuru **(from Kiyomi's summary of Eldia's past history with Hizuru in chapter 107)**

**Unknown to c. 743: The Great Titan War** \- Karl Fritz, the 145th monarch of the Fritz family, inherits the Founding Titan and succeeds his predecessor as the monarch of Eldia. Ashamed of Eldia's history of genocide and civil war, Fritz conspires with the Tybur family, an Eldian house possessing the War Hammer Titan, to bring about Eldia's downfall.

The Tybur family fabricates the story of a Marleyan man named Helos to instigate the Eldian in-fighting and serve as a hero for the oppressed people of Marley. **(ch. 99)**

Karl Fritz gathers most of the Fritz royal family to Paradis Island, Eldia's last remaining undisputed territory **(ch. 86)** and moves the capital to that island, abandoning the conflict between the eight other Titan houses. He also invites Asians from the Shogun clan of Hizuru **(ch. 107)** Some Fritz royals disagree with the King's decision to abandon the war, and remain behind in the mainland. In the King's absence, the other eight Houses wage civil war. **(ch. 86)**

The surviving Marleyans took advantage of this and incited a rebellion. The Tybur family is the first to side with the Marleyan uprising. **(ch. 95)**

Over the course of the war, the Marleyans succeed in gaining the power of six more of the Nine Titans possessed by Eldia: the Colossal Titan, the Armored Titan, the Female Titan, the Beast Titan, the Cart Titan, and the Jaw Titan.

Using the seven Titans, Marley gradually gains control of the continent. **(ch. 86)**

King Fritz uses the Founding Titan to create and order countless Colossus Titans to form the three concentric Walls—Maria, Rose, and Sheena—to protect the remnants of Eldia. **(ch. 64)**

**c.743** \- In order to stop the war, King Fritz sends a false message to the people of Marley, demanding that the surviving Eldians must be left alone or the Colossus Titans will ""flatten the entire Earth.""

The Great Titan War ends. The nation of Marley would retain control of a large portion of the world beyond Paradis Island throughout the next century, using the power of the Titans. **(ch. 86)**

Hizuru's reputation is tarnished due to their association with Eldia. **(ch. 107)**

The Eldians who did not flee overseas would become low-class citizens of Marley, forced to live in internment zones separate from the rest of the population. **(ch. 89)**

After gaining control over the mainland, the Marley government promotes the story that Ymir Fritz had gained the Titan's power through a deal with the ""Devil of All Earth,"" who was slain by their hero Helos during the war. **(chapters 86, 88 and 98)**

King Fritz informs both the Fritz family in Marley and the Tybur family that he has made a vow renouncing war to the Founding Titan, and that there will be no retaliation if and when Marley chooses to enact a final solution against Eldia. **(ch. 89)** However, he asks that he and his people should be given a brief age of peace before their retribution. **(chapters 96 and 99)**

The King uses the power of the Founding Titan to erase the memories of the Subjects of Ymir. The Subjects successfully forget their history, but minority groups not sharing the majority's common bloodline such as the Ackerman clan and the Asian clan are unaffected by the mind wipe. Many of the minority groups swear to secrecy at the King's request and gain noble status, **(ch. 64)** but the Ackerman and Asian groups give up said status, turn against King Fritz, and are hunted down. (**ch.65)**

For the safe-keeping of the Founding Titan, the royal family lives in hiding as the noble Reiss family while another bloodline takes the place of the Fritz family as a false monarchy. **(ch. 89)**

The 145th Fritz King, now the First Reiss King, creates an underground cavern where the Founding Titan can be passed down to successors within the royal family. Some time afterward, a chapel is built above the entrance to the cavern. **(ch. 64)**

**(These events are extrapolated by , Rod Reiss' narration of the past of the Walls to Historia in chapter 64; Grandpa Ackerman's conversation (in a flashback) with Kenny during the latter's serial killer days in chapter 65; Grandpa Yeager's narration to Grisha and Grisha' reading of the documents that the Owl (Eren Kruger) sent him to the Restorationists in chapter 86; Kruger's explanation of his mission to Grisha (in a flashback) and Eren's recounting of it to Armin in chapter 88; a military meeting between Queen Historia, Darius Zackly, the leaders of the other branches of the military, Hange and Levi's squad in chapter 89 (recounting Grisha's flashback with Kruger); Pieck's recalling and discussion with other Warriors of the past and present role of the Tybur family in chapter 95; Reiner's discussion with Bertholdt and Annie of the current location of the Coordinate/Founder power and of the past threat of the Rumbling made by Karl Fritz in case the Walls were ever attacked in chapter 96; Theo Magath and Willy Tybur's discussion of Marley's upcoming political and military moves, Willy Tybur's friendly conversations with Kiyomi Azumabito, Ogweno and Nambia, and the beginning of Willy Tybur's speech to the other world diplomats and ambassadors in the Liberio ghetto in chapter 98; Willy Tybur's continuation of his speech to the other world diplomats and ambassadors in the Liberio ghetto, with emphasis on Eldia's violent past history, his family's and Karl Fritz's role in ending the Eldian Empire during the Great Titan War and Fritz's vow of renouncing war in chapter 99; Kiyomi Azumabito's discussion with the Survey Corps of Eldia's and Hizuru's shared history, and her conversation with Zeke Yeager about their covert past and planned actions, in chapter 107).**

**743** \- According to the traditional history taught in Paradis Island, this is when the entire human race except for the inhabitants of the island was devoured by the Titans **(a training instructor recounts available knowledge on the historical background of the Titans to his trainees, in chapter 2)**.

**Unknown** \- The Titan Biology Research Society is founded in Marley. After researching the nature of the Titans and the Subjects of Ymir, they determine that the power of the Titans is carried across ""paths"" invisible to the eye, with all ""paths"" coordinating at the Founding Titan. The people of Marley name the Founding Titan the ""Coordinate"" of these paths **(as recounted by Eren Kruger during his conversation with Grisha Yeager, in chapter 88).**

**I have more or less summed up Eldia’s history from its beginnings as a primitive tribe to the downfall of its empire during the Great Titan War (and the formation of the Titan Biology Research Society in Marley a little later). I won’t dwelve further in the timeline up to the beginning of the story (845) or to the current year (854) because it’s not strictly necessary to the point I’m trying to make and the post risks getting too long.**

I have written this because there is a widespread belief in this sub that Eldia’s crimes against Marley and/or the rest of the world either are entirely made-up enemy propaganda or that they happened just 2000 years ago and Eldia has done nothing wrong ever since. But the manga (and thus the sources I’ve provided clearly state otherwise). You could argue that it’s Isayama’s fault if the worldbuilding and lore of “Attack on Titan” has remained so vague or “incomplete” (I’m not saying it’s shit, but in our world it would be like trying to explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without mentioning ANYTHING of the past history of either Palestine or Israel or, to convey it from the Paradisian perspective, if suddenly the whole continent of Asia came out saying that more than half its population was exterminated a few decades ago by the United States and EVERY Asian state demanded revenge against contemporary Americans without providing an ounce of historical proof for their claims).

*The point being that the story is literally about a millennia old conflict that is barely explained, and we DON’T EVEN KNOW THE NAME OF ANY OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD except for Hizuru, Eldia and Marley. It’s like talking about Western European colonialism without mentioning a single African nation. The worldbuilding is shallow almost to the point of being inconsequential, but I think there is a good reason for that, which I will be getting into in a moment.*

**(DISCLAIMER: Before anyone says that the Eldians’ past crimes are Marleyan propaganda, I counter by saying that if such were the case, no one in the world would believe Marley, and especially no one would be willing to militarily team-up with them, considering Marley is engaging in imperialism right now, while the last istance of Eldian imperialism happened a hundred years before the story is set. The world trusts a notoriously warmongering nation such as Marley more than the oppressed ad innocent Eldians because the dangers posed by Titans/Eldians are well known and ingrained in the public, most likey by historical precedent. The threat posed by Titans (and thus Paradis) is still much greater than the one posed by the Marleyan military.)**

&#x200B;

The reason why the manga’s worldbuilding and lore seems so shoddy and sporadic is because it doesn’t necessarily need to be otherwise: Attack on Titan’s past history of the world closely resembles our own, unless stated to the contrary.

**I don’t like using TV Tropes (but I might use it again in the future) as reference or as a source of examples, but in this case it has the most appropriate tropes to describe what I’m talking about, a combination of these two:** [The Law of Conservation of Detail](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail) **and** [Like Reality Unless Noted](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted).

We can assume then, that in in AoT’s world, **history took more or less the same course as it did in ours (with notable exceptions when Titans are involved, of course)**: [Marley and Eldia were always at war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_warfare_between_the_Romans_and_Germanic_tribes), both became at some point [expansionist and colonial powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_empire#European_colonial_empires), both erased a number of native cultures to ensure the spread of theirs (the whole “*Eldians became immune to a viral epidemic thanks to the Founding Titan while others suffered it in full*” reminds me of the European settlers being “healthy carriers” of the diseases they brought to the New World the Native Americans suffering due to them instead, during the “[Columbian Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbian_exchange)”) and the Eldians justifying their imperialism with their (this time more founded in reality) claims to be “the [master race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism#Racial)”, superior to all others.

Come on. This is the man that gave us the final panel (or at least an idea for it) as well as the 'final audio' years before the ending, the man that put the 'See you later' (which was also not in the anime lol) in chapter 1 and just paid off that plot point 137 chapters later. Chapter 130 was last year, and I don't see why that chapter would contain all those Historia scenes (as well as the *panelling* intercut with the dialogue about Mikasa) if she was irrelevant to Eren's arc (also considering there are very few characters that need their arcs wrapped up - Eren *and* Historia are two of them). I find it EXTREMELY hard to believe some simple anime cuts are confirmation that Isayama changed his mind on the baby plotline; and it's even weirder to see people so convinced about its irrelevance (unless they're the ususal Historia haters, then that's understandable).

Let's not forget that the anime still kept Eren smiling at Historia, him defending her at the meeting, her tearing up about it, and him getting angry to hear they have to sacrifice her (and the latter three were even made more apparent in the anime). Some people were saying that Isayama saw the father theory and, since it wasn't his intention, he asked the studio to remove foreshadowing in favor of Eren being the father. That makes no sense - if that was the case, the anime could have just as easily removed some EH scenes like Historia tearing up, or dialed back Eren's protectiveness, as well as changed dialogue either for the due date or for the farmer (they could have mentioned him as her husband or something if they really wanted to remove any chance for Eren). Also, the anime cut all but one of the foreshadowing scenes of Zeke working with Eren and his plans; and this episode they didn't even show the 'forest' comparison with Zeke and Eren, foreshadowing their different ideologies, so it's not like only scenes with Hisu foreshadowing are cut. The anime is NOT the definite version of the story.

There's less than a month until the final chapter.

# Examining the School Caste AU

If you don't know what School Castes is, it's a series of previews made by Isayama before releasing every volume since the 21st volume. You can read it [here](https://imgur.com/a/85D7yJa). It's a ""what if"" alternate universe that puts our characters in a high school setting...

First of all, Isayama himself has confirmed that School Castes is a part of AoT's main story:

&#x200B;

[School caste is canon](https://preview.redd.it/evme2g1i64991.jpg?width=1053&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56e9b0b834c304949192c3a5f464360708f683d4)

Now let's examine another instance, where he shared his inspiration for writing this AU... [This](http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazime/archives/9324702.html) is an old post on Isayama's blog from 2016, and [This](https://ningen-suki.tumblr.com/post/148873324514/i-just-realized-people-might-be-interested-in-a/) is an accurate translation of it... a quick summary of what he said:

""Why an American High School? There are two things that influenced me; The game, *Life is Strange*. It was so good! A masterpiece! It’s a well-made video game as well as a film... The setting is an American school in the countryside...""

In *Life is Strange*, the main character has time manipulation powers, and finds out that every time she rewinds time, her choices affect her life in a butterfly effect. ""**the unbearable losses and partings in our lives. the story is about whether or not we can accept them.**""

Before I move on to the next part, Let me also mention that School caste has been animated in the anime too (making them even more canon to the story)

&#x200B;

[Goth Mikasa and nerd Armin](https://preview.redd.it/99mpqefy64991.png?width=1820&format=png&auto=webp&s=34baeda1caf81bb127577621c7ef3eb696777f69)

Now there's no reason to adapt this in ***such detail*** if it was just an easter egg. In the manga, this was a tiny shard that you could barely make out. that's how you do easter eggs, But THIS right here... is something different.

# Examining Mikasa's Lost Girls OVA

First a quick rundown of what happens in this OVA:  


* During Mikasa's breakdown at the Battle of Trost (episode 6 of anime), due to intense emotional crisis, she envisions/creates another world where her parents never died, the Fall of Sīgansina never happened, and she and Eren are free to live happy uneventful lives.
* As a consequence of Wall Maria never being breached, the Scout Regiment is eventually disbanded from lack of results, and all gates leading out of Wall Maria are sealed permanently.
* Despite everything, it is fundamental to Eren's nature to yearn for freedom, and thus hatches a plan with Armin to escape the walls via a hot air balloon... Before Mikasa can reunite with Eren on the day of departure, she is waylaid by what appears to be a manifestation of fate: the Mirror Man.
* The masked man warns her that she will not be able to meet Eren anymore and that Eren will leave her behind. The Mirror Man *knows things he shouldn't*. He states he is no one, but can be anyone at the same time.  
Handing Mikasa a knife, he says that he knows that she is lost, and is here in this world **she created** expressly because **she could not accept Eren's death**. then Mikasa has sudden apparitions of events in the prime timeline that induces her to stab the Mirror Man.
* Mikasa is unable to prevent Eren's death. Because Eren saved Armin by throwing him out of the faulty hot air balloon before it crashed, Mikasa would never have been able to save him without losing Armin. Back in the present, she acknowledges to herself that no one can stop Eren's fate, but resolves to be by his side no matter where he goes.

Now we know that this OVA [is semi-canon](https://thebestofotaku.com/attack-on-titan-ova-filler-list/) to the story, and it has been approved by Isayama along with the 'No Regrets' and 'Ilse's notebook' OVAs. 

It is an adaptation of a spin-off novel but it is implied that Isayama himself supervised said adaptation. this is also why the novel and the anime adaptation have some differences... 

The novel's author was [Hiroshi Seko](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=78744); he has been a scriptwriter of the anime for every season and was the only major staff member not to change (after the transition from WIT to MAPPA)... He has also worked closely with Isayama on the anime's script since the beginning, dating back to 2013-2014.

There was also a blue butterfly in the anime adaptation, which I believe was inspired by a similar blue butterfly from Life is strange. (He played LIS in 2016 and helped with the OVA adaption in 2018)  


[The top image is from LIS - The bottom one is from Mikasa's OVA](https://preview.redd.it/8j4vafi2b4991.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e516c99a833f07e321993bae285de514dccbaa1)

So until this point, we know that there are multiple timelines in the story and that Mikasa has the power to create alternate realities herself... which brings me to the final part...

# The ""See you later"" dream in ch 138 

First, let me ask you an important question; What exactly was that dream sequence that Mikasa saw in 138? Did Eren manipulate her memories? The answer is obviously No... because we know Ackermen minds can't be altered or tampered with.

So the explanations most people have settled on are these: ""Eren's showing her this dream through Paths"" or ""Eren created this illusionary world in Paths and then brought Mikasa to Paths and they lived 4 years"" -- both of these, boil down the explanation to ""PATHS MAGIC"" -- Now I wanna show you why this explanation is flawed:

Here's something a lot of people don't know about ch 138...

After this chapter was released, they changed the [""story""](https://i.imgur.com/GxqCMY0.png) section on the [official website](https://shingeki.net/#/)... and used the title [""序章""](https://shingeki.net/#/story) which means ""prologue""/""preface""

Another change they made is adding that panel of Ch138, when Mikasa says the ""See you later"" line, in the background but with Mikasa's perspective.   


[序章 means prologue](https://preview.redd.it/s5t7s7hxc4991.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5120a3248ed2debf225fe30148da9a0fd56ad193)

This basically tells us that ""Hey, remember that dream in 138? we're using that exact panel for chapter 1 of the story now. and we're calling it a preface""... **which means that this 'dream' sequence happens before the entire story even begins.**

How does this put holes in the ""PATHS MAGIC"" explanation? well, here's what we know for certain about paths: ""It's another dimension that transcends physical space... but more importantly, IT TRANSCENDS TIME.""

If Mikasa's dream is a result of using the power of PATHS, then how is it called a prologue/preface?  
We know we can't pinpoint an exact time for a path's dream because there is no time in paths. it transcends time... it should not have a single specific time when it happened. By giving it a label like PROLOGUE, they're basically telling us that this isn't just the work of PATHS MAGIC...  
.  
.  
Now using every clue and piece of evidence I shared in this post, here's my explanation for what Mikasa's dream actually was:

The events of Chapter 138 were no dream, but another instance of the same alternate-reality phenomena shown in the ""Lost in the Cruel World"" OVA. 

Eren did absolutely nothing in regards to that 138 dream. He didn't show Mikasa anything... Mikasa saw that dream entirely of her own volition.

It was simply *another* alternate timeline (that Mikasa has created) where Eren and Mikasa lived out their days in peace -- Just like in her OVA... with a similar setup, damning price, and ultimate endgame.

Basically, Mikasa has this hidden power that facilitates ""reincarnation *fantasies/realities""...* BUT she doesn't know she's doing it... She subconsciously (because she loves Eren to the point of obsession) uses this power every time Eren dies or she thinks Eren is dead.   
Plus, she loses her memories or it all feels like a dream to her afterward.

# Conclusion

The ""See you later""/cabin dream is a previous timeline... After Eren died peacefully in that timeline, Mikasa subconsciously creates another timeline to see her love again... that new timeline is what we got in the manga.

... 

\[**Potential argument:** ""But this can't be a 'different timeline' scenario, since if Mikasa and Eren had run away together in that reality, Eren would not have gotten into Paths with Zeke, therefore he would not have forced his father to kill Frida and therefore would not have received the Founder.""

**Explanation:** ""Again... PATHS is another dimension that transcends both time and space; meaning, it can also transcend timelines. Once Eren achieved the founder's power in the manga/anime, he used it to manipulate events, not only in his own timeline but the previous timeline as well.""\]",False,False,titanfolk,"How school caste, Mikasa's OVA, and ch 138 PROVE the Existence of Multiple Timelines (Just a Reminder)",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/vpnxio/how_school_caste_mikasas_ova_and_ch_138_prove_the/

On top of that this is not literally everything we know as I realized halfway through making this post that as much as I would like to get as much detail and information that we have in this post I am also lazy lol. 

I would also like to add that my information is based off what leakers said, mappa staff interviews, and just in general all the information we have been getting. 

Lets start off with the most worrisome thing. 

Is Attack On Titan's final season only going to have 16 episodes to finish the rest of the manga? 

Short answer:No there will 100% be a continuation. 

Longer answer: There has been conflicting news between the leakers where some are saying it will be split and some are saying it will not be split. 

So to make it simple they were talking about 2 different things. This [Tweet](https://twitter.com/michaelg163/status/1332319375043518467?s=19) should clear things up. 

There was confusion as to whether the 16 episodes will be split or not so when Spy found out they will not be split he said [This](https://twitter.com/Spytrue/status/1332293109758234624?s=19). Everybody then  got worried when Eslam (another leaker) said it will be split but what he was referring to was not the 16 episodes but the season as a whole. 

THERE WILL BE A CONTINUATION. 

What is currently happening now is they are focusing on production for the 16 ep they are releasing, but they are having meetings or at least they plan on having meetings to figure out how they want to continue the series.  

The pacing will not be rushed. Of course things will be cut (as every anime does) but Hayashi is passionate about seeing this through faithfully to the end. 

The first episode is said to cover chapter 91 and about 80% of 92 while the second episode will finish 92 and maybe go until the beginning of ch 94. There is also what spy said about 1.30=1 I'm just gonna link my [""Breakdown"" ](https://twitter.com/michaelg163/status/1332328638382043138?s=19) based off what spy said and then deleted. 

**THE STAFF*****

Yuichiro Hayashi- Extremely talented director that brings the best out of the team and material he works with. Example: Kakeuguri had a bad director of photography but look how that show turned out. On top of that he created new settings for where the games were played whereas in the manga they are usually in the same room. He has a long list of talented connections he may be able to bring on board to draw some beautiful scenes. 

Jun Shishido as Chief Director- He is a veteran as well in the industry having directed a few shows and working plenty of other positions on shows one of them notably being Hajime no ippo which has some of the most intense storyboards thanks to him and his direction. He is sure to bring a lot of talent to the table and help Hayashi with his job a lot. 



Tomohiro Kishi- Extremely talented. As we already saw he created gorgeous designs but they are extremely complex and difficult to animate. The fact that he isn't the Chief Animation Director is very worrisome but is being made up by 2 veterans which I will get to soon. From the recent MAPPA staff interviews we learned that he was busy with other works and that AoT work was dumped on his desk. He was basically forced to do it. Maybe we can see him be more hands on for Part 2 but for now this is what we have. 

Daisuke ninumma and Manabu Akita- The 2 Chief animation directors for the series. Daisuke Ninuma has been around for awhile doing key animation for many shows and animation director for lots of episodes of series directed by Hayashi so they will have a very good chemistry but he's not the one I want to talk about. 

Manabu akita is a recent surprise. I may be overusing the word veteran but this man is the definition of veteran. He's been working on some of the best shows you have seen like Death Note, Fma,fmab,Jojo etc... he was also character designer and Chief animation director for Kakeuguri and that was an extremely visually appealing show. He is an incredible animator and him working on the show almost makes up for Kishi not being CAD. 

Kazuo Ogura- Not much needs to be said for him. He worked on some of the best looking films as art director that Toei produced including DBS Broly, one piece gold, one piece film z. Hes been complimented by Cao a Chinese 3dcg director and episode director working on the show. He says "" the art director is very good the backgrounds are beautiful and he has a interesting understanding of 3D backgrounds. I think enough has been said. 

Hiroshi Seko- She (i think its a woman) wrote the script for like every show you have been watching recently 🤣🤣. She worked on AoT before and even wrote a novel for it called Lost girls. Not much else to say but we should be in good hands. 

Shigeki Asawa- She is the biggest question mark of the season we are all aware of the blur in the trailer but like I said Hayashi can handle a bad DoP. Keep in mind that trailer was pre animated and that the newer shots of Colt and Falco look much better than the trailer in terms of composition. I think it will turn out fine. 

Takahiro Uezeno- Not very familiar with him but he did work on a few shows in the CG aspect like Yuri on Ice, dorohedoro, inuyashiki. Nothing to complain about here. 

Yusuke Tanawa- Screen layout designer is a very rare and special role in animation production . Usually the animators make the layout so hes saving alot of time by being in charge of layout design.  He basically takes the storyboard and brings it to life and then the animators just work from there instead of just the storyboards. 

I think that's about it when it comes to key staff. But I will just address some other stuff we heard about the staff. 

We heard that there are very special people animating the OP. We heard there is a  ""super"" animator working on the show. There is also a lot of other  talent that I am positive will be coming in. Without going into why each person is on this list here is a list of people I believe will be working on it. 

Keinchiro Watanabe 
Yoshimichi Kameda
Arifumi Imai 
Gosei Oda 
Hironori Tanaka 

I can't think of anymore off the top of my head right now but there is def more who can make an appearance. 

Last bit about the staff and then I'm moving on to production. 

Mr Cao (that's what I call him) I mentioned him earlier, I don't know much about him but he is a 3DCG Director and episode director on the show hes directing at least a couple of episodes. 

Shuhei yubuta- Vinand saga director, 3d director for s1 of aot ( he basically is part of the genius behind the 3DMG scenes) he was 3d producer for s2 and 3 of aot as well. He doesn't need introduction you all know who he is. 

A 3DCG Director from studio V sign is also coming i dont remember the name. 

**Production Schedule**

To keep it simple they are on schedule but it has been hellish.  The character Designs being as complex as they are and the new survey corps outfit not having the cloak on and having so many lines to draw makes it extremely hard to animate.  On top of all these issues the character designer is not the chief animation director. 

 As far as I know this is the most difficult part of the production for them. But the 1st episode is a 100% finished and the 2nd and 3rd episodes are close to being finished they are on schedule though. 


I hope you guys read this post and it made you feel better. I know this post could have been made a lot better but I'm not great at this. 

I would love to get some feedback on this and if you guys have questions about anything I said feel free to ask and I will provide my reasoning for everything I said. I got too tired of typing to put it all into one post right now.

Last minute note is that this team is a beast and i believe if they had another 6-12 months they would blow our minds but sadly this is the animation industry we are talking about.

 They are working their absolute hardest to give use what we want. Lets please respect the staff and the animators for doing the best they could. 

I may add more things to this post as it comes to me so keep an eye out.

As the top comment says, there was a mistranslation and Kaji was referring to the meeting for the final chapter, not the final episode. 

Yams asks of Kaji to hold onto the emotions that he felt for the ""tatakae!"" scene and put them into Eren for the last chapter.


 The things I've gathered from this are: 

-**Eren will be in (and have lines) chapter 139.**

-**Eren will be emotional (crying) in chapter 139.**

-**Chapter 139 will not be 100% epilogue.**

Communication.

There are 3 moments throughout the entire story where Mikasa and Eren have a one on one conversation. (Discounting first ep as that was mainly an introduction) And only 1 of these occur without outside interference, (i.e. death, murder, titans, chaos, etc.)

1. Eren wraps scarf around Mikasa
2. End of s2, Eren punches Dina
3. Chap123, Eren ""What am i to you""

Sorry if these upsets you. Not a single on of these moments were romantic on erens part.

When Mikasa first sees eren's titan, she describes it as the “reification of mankinds anger"". This is because the world they exist in is a cruel one, a hell for eldians, in which every facet is designed to make their lives miserable. In order to make sense of these, you see many instances of characters capitulating to the world. 145th eldian kings ideology, ""vow to renounce war"". Kenny's ""Everyone was a slave to something"". Armin's, which was to look back on the little things, as well as his own self-hatred and survivor syndrome.

Erens nature, his desire for freedom, and his status as the main character, are therefore not coincidences. He was designed to be the one person to go against this philosophy, to rebel against this world regardless of its virtues, sins, and obligations. We see this throughout the story; whenever he is faced with death, or a situation he sees as removal of his freedom and those around him, he will do whatever it takes to rectify it.

People continously misuse kenny quote and apply it to Eren, but the whole point of his character is that hes beyond this. He beyond the same shackles that bind everyone else in servitude to this cruel world, and desires to escape it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

so,

1. &#x200B;

Eren did not kill those men, for Mikasa. It wasnt about her. He killed those men, because he saw them abusing someone, taking away her freedoms simply because they have the power to do so. It was not some romantic gesture, nor was he some idyllic hero, some knight, trying to save a damsel in distress. He murdered them in cold blood, stabbing them repeatedly, tricking them, and screaming about how they should die, and proceeded to act like nothing had happened. Mikasa, however, inteprets his actions AS solely for her. AS this hero, trying to save her. And it is that understanding that drives her pursuit of Eren throughout the entire story. Nevertheless, Eren did not see that in the same way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2.

End of s2. Eren has just had his whole world turned upside down. Annie betrayed them. Bertholdt betrayed them. Reiner betrayed them. Dina, the same titan that devoured his mother, the cornerstone of the first episode and first chapter and the most impactful moment in Eren's life, just slaughtered Hannes. And Eren couldn't do shit about it. The scouts are being massacred. Everything he knows, everyone he loves, and anything he could ever dream about is about to die. Why tf would he be thinking about Mikasa?

In this scene we see Mikasa capitulating to the cruel world. She sees the situation as hopeless, and thanks Eren for everything she thinks he has done FOR HER. Nevertheless, Eren denies this. Because he DIDNT do this for her. He did this for HIS own desire for freedom, for HIS dreams. Im not saying she aint important but THINK about what is going on. The man just had a mental breakdown, screaming at the ground about his worthlessness. Why people think him staring at Mikasa confused for a couple seconds when everyone is dying around them is a sign of his overwhelming love for her confuses the shit out of me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3.

Chap 123. Im not trying to insult your reading the comprehension, but you should at least recognize that this occurs at the same time as the flashback in 131. At this point, Eren is similarly having a mental breakdown, over whether or not to commit the rumbling. He apologizes to Ramzi profusely, asking for his forgiveness, and considers how he himself is a hypocrite just like Reiner, the person he used to hate so much. (Chronologically this occurs before the declaration of war) He recognized that he is about to slaughter everyone around him, despite them having done nothing wrong, and similarly recognizes how there was no other way to do so. Nevertheless, he is only human, and cannot accept it.

As already established, Mikasa saw and still sees Eren as this idyllic hero figure that saved her when she was a kid. Nevertheless, it doesn't take genius to recognize that this is the furthest away from his true self. His question ""What am i to you?"" wasnt some fucking love request, ""am i your brother, or your mother, or your boyfriend"" or whatever else you interpret it as. Hes questioning what she sees him as. A hero, a villain, good, evil etc.

Immediately prior to this he had been crying in front of Ramzi at the sins he was about to commit. Mikasa being the dumbass she is sees it as some romantic gesture, and so does the shipper side of the fanbase. Mikasa at the beginning of the same chapter literally states ""If eren was this way all along, what side of him had we been seeing?"", cause she hadnt been seeing the real him. Shed still been seeing him through the lense of their childhood experiences, which leads to misconclusion. Louise pursuit of Mikasa is a reflection of this. Thats why Isayama put that flashback of the cabin when she saw Louise saluting in the cell.

Furthermore, this occurs BEFORE erens talk with zeke, within which he asks him about Mikasa, and her affection for him. This talk occurs months later. Therefore, CLEARLY he had no clue of Mikasa’s affection when asking her that question. It was only after that, that he came to terms with it and then lied to her at the table meeting, (for no fucking reason I might add).

Im not saying Eren dosnt love her (ehh), but its not the kind of love that would lead to a romantic, couple relationship. A famous quote about Isayama is that he was ""too shy"" to draw them kissing at end of s2. However, many comments have been made at how this is inaccurate. He wasnt shy. He was hesitant. Because back then he didn’t write for the fans. Back then he didn’t care for the ships. Because he wouldn't know how to depict their relationship, when BOTH SIDES ARE NOT AT THAT STAGE YET.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Overall, Eren does not reciprocate her feelings, the only place he does is 139, which for the above reasons, illustrates ONE of its plot holes. This relationship is one-sided, and they may not be strangers, but know damn well Mikasa did not understand Eren AT ALL until the final chapters of the story.

He's tried to kill her twice

Here is my criticism on the rumbling arc.

I don't consider myself a yeagerist or alliance fa n. I adore all important characters (from both sides) and don't care if they're right or wrong, they all fight for what they believe in and that's what makes them great. The only reason I wanted them to stop the rumbling is because It would be nice conclusion to some character arcs (Reiner, Armin, Zeke, Levi, Jean, Connie). 

There are many things that I like (mostly alliance related) but there are some things that annoy me. Here are some of the most annoying things in the rumbling arc. 

This is just my opinion.

&#x200B;

1. Paths. Introduction of paths made Yams able to write whatever plot convenient thing he wants and explain it as: PATHS. Armin got swallowed by ~~a lizard~~ okapi and he has two bodies? Paths. He finds random leaf and shows it to Zooko, but Zooko sees baseball? Paths. Dead shifters appear in paths? Paths. He's chilling on the ship with Annie but he's suddenly in skies with child Eren? Paths. The alliance (including the Ackermans) connect to paths with kid Eren and Ymir?Paths. Eren interacts with Mikasa's dream to tell her to let him go? Paths.
2. Dragon Ball Z. I never seen Dragon Ball Z but according to the memes it's about dudes fighting for 100 episodes and going ""this isn't even my final form"" and they have plot armor and it's very ridiculous and written to look epic instead of interesting. Final battle is hundreds of titans spawning like ants and alliance fighting them, Armin enters the paths and makes some of them his allies with the help of Zeke, he nukes Eren, Eren transforms again, taperowm titanizes humans, they fight again. I don't mind multiple transformations but this battle seems like Yams tried to make it epic as possible instead of battles in previous arcs that were actually interesting and not silly extreme.
3. Eren. Main character but we haven't seen his POV for months. We see him in flashbacks sometimes but the only thing we know about ""rumbling Eren"" is from other characters. Eren talks to them when he invites Armin to share the dream of freedom with him, when he enters Mikasa's dream to tell her to forget him and have a long life, and when he invites alliance to paths and tells them to throw hands. Everything else is known from other characters; ""Eren is just moving forward and Ymir is the one who is creating new titans"" -Armin ""Eren is probably suffering killing this many people and hopes to be stopped"" -Reiner 
4. It's like the previous seasons were about the characters but this season treats characters like plot devices? The characters had more personality before Marley arc and literally everyone except Zeke and Reiner was downgraded a little (or sidelined). Literally everyone.
5. Cheap shock value (that doesn't even work most of the time) Oh noo Eren is peniz to Armin and Mikasa, oh noo Armin got captured. No he's fine. Nuuu Levi is dead, Reiner got bodied again 🙄, Eren lost his head, Jean and Connie are titans now and eating Reiner, ~~they will probably turn back next chapter when the worm dies~~
6. Falco evolving like pokemon, Hange dying just to give a title to Armin (title that ruins his life even more as if he didn't have enough responsibility), saving the plane was the most pointless subplot ever
7. I couldn't care less about Azumabito subplot or Karena and her 20/20 vision, why does she have so many panels? There are so many things unexplained and storylines unfinished makes me worried for the final chapter.

Reference to the Starry Night in Red Swan OP:

Fallen angel = Eren

Greeks referred to fallen angels as ""**giants**"". The Greek translation emerged from the three interconnected biblical passages (**human-divine hybrids** in Genesis 6, **autochthonous people** in Numbers 13 and **ancient warriors trapped in the underworld** in Ezekiel 32) .

The giants were liminal figures resulting from the union of the opposite orders and as such retained the unclear status between the human and divine.

Driven by the winds of time = Fate, not driven not by his free will

Starry Night = Manga Ending

**- 1 big tree**

This deliberate reference allows us to use 150 years of people analysing the meaning behind the painting to apply that analysis to the ending of the manga.

Why did Van Gogh paint exactly 11 stars? It is believed that he was directly referencing Genesis 37:9, a key verse in the biblical account of Joseph, a ""dreamer"" and an outcast among his eleven brothers. It isn't hard to see why Van Gogh might have identified with the Biblical character of Joseph in Genesis. No matter what Joseph did, he could not receive the acceptance or respect of his 11 older brothers. Likewise, as an artist, Van Gogh failed to win the recognition of the art critics of his day despite his best efforts.

This implies that the 11 crows in the very last panel represent his Erens friends that opposed Eren.

This would explain why Isayama literally kept bringing back dead people AND show their opposition to Eren. Isayama made sure we see literally all characters oppose Eren.

If the 11 stars symbolize Van Gogh's critics, where is Vincent Van Gogh in *Starry Night*? Van Gogh identifies himself with the looming cypress tree in the foreground of the painting.

This perfectly fits with the final volume cover.

In the very final panel, there is Eren (tree where he was buried) and 11 crows (Erens friends that oppose him and the rumbling).

In the final volume cover, we see Eren and his 11 friends that were even brought back from death to show us that they oppose him and the rumbling.

After Erens death, Historia says that he may have been right.

This implies that she also was not on his side in the manga ending. If she would have agreed with rumbling, she would not have said that he MAY have been right.

This means that all 11 Erens friends were against the rumbling in the manga.

In Genesis 37:9, Joseph in a sense tells his brothers/detractors about his dream to let them know that he believed that one day the tables would turn. Van Gogh also might have intended *Starry Night* to work as a personal statement concerning his poor critical reception as an artist. Beyond just the fact that the artist truly did receive respect later on — in Van Gogh's case, posthumously. While Van Gogh died a poor and disrespected artist, he is now one of the most famous and reproduced painters today.

Van Gogh dying without convincing his critics perfectly parallels Eren.

**Isayama said that the manga ending is a failure, the same way Van Gogh wrote in his letters of the Starry Night as a failure.**

If Isayama was inspired by Van Gogh to make Eren, the failure of the manga ending could have been intentional, so the **anime ending can tell us how to avoid failing like Van Gogh**.

Because Van Gogh eventually, AFTER HIS DEATH, managed to convince his critics of his dream, I think Eren will manage to convince his friends to side with the rumbling AFTER HIS DEATH IN THE MANGA. We will see this in the anime.

More foreshadowing of AOE:

Critics theorize that the ""**hidden content**"" of the Starry Night refers to the New Testament, revealing an ""**apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth**, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.""

What would you think about me bearing a child? The answer to Historias question is a hidden content. 

Notice that the hidden content takes place at a FIELD. FARM FIELD.

I found that Von Goghs commonly considered last painting, Wheatfield with Crows, has both the FIELD and the CROWS from the very last manga panel.

https://preview.redd.it/eyqn795er9o71.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86308e4c1a03892ed809d1f66728567d5556325

From a symbolic perspective it's worthwhile to review the basic elements of the painting and then explore how each different interpretation could apply to Eren.

**The paths**: It's not a difficult leap to symbolically equate the separate paths in *Wheat Field with Crows* with the three timelines, Chapter 138, Manga Timeline and Anime Timeline. The paths are basically comprised of three sets: two in each foreground corner and a third in the middle winding toward the horizon. The left and right foreground paths defy logic in that they seem to originate from nowhere and lead to nowhere. The third, middle path has remained the most fertile for symbolic interpretation. Does the path lead anywhere? Does it successfully transverse the wheat field and lead to hope? Or does it, in fact, terminate in another hell?

ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP MOVING FORWARD CAN KNOW FOR SURE!

The crows: In his epistulae Van Gogh often refers to birds as a symbol of freedom.

Attack on Titan associates crows with Eren and the rumbling.

This suggests that EREN WILL ACHIEVE FREEDOM WITH THE RUMBLING.

**The sky**: Van Gogh allegedly perceived storms as a vital and positive part of nature. I think this relates to natalism.

https://preview.redd.it/v9mypockr9o71.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=7212b5209b5b19422993e655587f4ecd904de46b

It is commonly believed that Van Gogh described the painting as conveying ""sadness and extreme loneliness"" on the one hand, but also ""health and restorative forces"" on the other.

I think this semi-positive interpretation would fit post-rumbling Eren perfectly.

Hence, I think we will get a Wheatfield with Crows ending in the anime.

So I sort of have a theory regarding AoT, the past and the future of it, and I hope this could be of interest to some of you. Sorry if it has some holes in it still, it's just a bit complex and confusing.  
Anyway here it is:  


Seeing that both Ymir's and Eren's tree look extremely similar and lets say it's not just for the sake of symbolism, there is a possibility that all eternity of human history is an infinite loop.  
The idea itself wouldn't be far fetched since the story we see in AoT from Ymir acquiring the titan powers, to the defeat of Eren is already a loop that had been confirmed by Eren himself, something like a locked timeline without any other possible outcome.  
When Zeke explains the concept of life to Armin in the anime, that monologue has pictures of the insectoid creature which is also called as ""the source of all living matter"" (source of titan powers) over it. Zeke mentions that life itself (which could be interpreted as the said creature) is something that clinges to life, it is desperate to survive and always finds a way to do so. If we can believe in this, it could be possible that the source of all living matter at the moment of its (most likely) death had some sort of offspring planted in Eren's head, or at least some way to survive. It could make sense considering that the original being was attached to Eren's head almost like a spinal cord from the moment Zeke caught Eren's head that was shot off by Gabi.  
If this is all true and there is some sort of offspring in Eren's head, then by Mikasa keeping it after the final decapitation and most likely burrying it under the iconic tree which Eren and Mikasa visited often in their childhood, then it's possible that the offspring started to live or at least remain there under the roots of the tree. Which then grows into a very similar looking tree as Yimir's was.  
It's important to note Eren's final words at the end of the last end credits song's original version; Nisennen... Moshiku wa... Nimannen Go no kimi e by Linked Horizon, which were: ""To you, in 2.000 years... or... 20.000 years from now..."" (the title of the song means the same).  
We know that the title of the very first episode is ""To you, in 2.000 Years"" and from later on we also know that this is sort of a message to Eren from the time of Yimir acquiring the titan powers. Later on we also find out that everything during this 2.000 years had always been manipulated by Eren in the future, so it's essentially a message to himself. It most likely is the beginning of a truly important lesson that he figured out.  
But here comes the interesting thing.  
During the end credits we see an incredibly sped up change of time and evolution of Paradise island.  
It is not clear how much time passes exactly, but for all we know it could even be 20.000 years.  
In any case at this point in time, after the end of the credits we see a dystopian looking Paradise where a boy finds the tree of Eren and a hole in it (very much like Yimir's). This boy wears a scarf, has the same color of hair as an Ackerman. A bit earlier when the credits start to roll we see Mikasa with a child infront of the tree where Eren's grave is. So we can speculate that she had offsprings, and we could also further speculate that the boy who finds Eren's tree in the distant future can be a descendant of Mikasa.  
Another important thing is that once Eren gets full control over the founder and all of its powers from Yimir, ha can begin his journey back in time, to manipulate history. The interesting thing is that we never hear anything about going to the future (at least not in a way to influence it), now this could be because this time traveling possibility only exists until the source of all living matter exists. But we also know about he existence of the Path, which is a place where time stands (almost) still and all Eldians are connected from all times (not only that but it also looks like a giant spectral tree, another symbol). And even though this connection is possible because of the source of all living matter which is destroyed at the end of The battle of Heaven and Earth, up until that point Eren is given full controll he has acces to all past and future Eldians. And Eldians (regardless of having titan powers or not) continue to live in the future as well. So potentially when Eren has full control, he could see and reach out to future Eldians as well, even after the loss of titan powers. The way I think about it is at the Path during a certain time, reaching out both backward and forward is possible without limits, but as soon as this certain period ends it becomes impossible to reach anywhere, also reaching the Path is most likely impossible. Nevertheless from that specific point in time and space (when Eren has full controll) it was possible, and its effects will carry on in the real world in the future even if the Path itself is unreachable or doesn't exist anymore. But even if this wouldn't be a possible way for Eren to reach out to an Eldian descendant (20.000 year from now) there could still be another way. If there truly is an offspring for the source of all living matter and it had been dormant for 20.000 years, and now the boy who is possibly a descendant of Mikasa gets in contact with it, it would possibly mean that this boy would inherit all the titan powers. (This would begin a new repetition of cycles and the action itself would connect the cycles as Mikasa's actions of killing Eren were needed to set Yimir the original founder truly free, and now it would start again with someone from her blood.) This event could connect all Eldians once more with the Path, which is why the previous statement could also stand that that's where Eren could get in contact with him. But there's another way, and that is because of the Attack Titan's ability of seeing glimpses from the lives of it's future users.  
If the future boy becomes the new founding titan, that would mean it also possesses the Attack Titan as originally the 9 titan shifters were one within Yimir as well. And this means that Eren as the last known Attack Titan could indeed have had glimpses from this point in the very distant future, hence his final words which are said at the end of the song: (""To you, in 2000 years... or...) 20.000 years from now"". And the thing is, he wouldn't even understand it necessarily as he confesses at one point to Armin that he is lost in the fact that for him past, present and future exists at the same time. Hence could be the pauses in the sentence/message in the form of ""...""s. A succesfull contact, (possibly even control) from Eren would make even more sense because of the Ackerman bloodline. Mikasa both loved and was loyal to Eren, so it wouldn't be surprising if this feeling in some way would also have been passed down through her descendants.  
It is also an interesting choice - and I say choice because with AoT there are no coincidences - that Eren's message is only said at the end of the original song and it cannot be heard during the last episode of AoT's post credit scene when the boy finds the tree. So this all might or might not be true.  
But another reason why a huge infinite loop wouldn't be a far fatched idea is because AoT portrays an endless cycle of hatered where humanity always finds itself fighting other humans again and again.  
So maybe the fact - which we see proof of with the futuristic war during the end credits - that the cycle of hatered and humans ultimately cannot change is because all of humanity's history is connected through the Eldians blood line and the source of all living matter. (It might all even be a godlike Eren's doing just so that he can live a life with Mikasa and Armin the way he did.)  
Another little fun fact from Linked Horizon's final end credits song: The lyrics are written as if they would be Mikasa's words (or at least until the ""Requiem"" part where there is a change of singers as well) and at one point ""cypress tree"" is mentioned and is refered to the tree which Eren liked most and is burried under.  
Not only did this tree had religious importance and symbolisom for the Zoroastrian religion in the anciant times in the real, our world of humanity for it's long roots and the tree endlessly reaching for the sky (just like Eren in AoT), but it also has a meaning. The cypress tree is the symbol for eternity and long life. I found this sentence on a website: ""The Zoroastrian word for tree is the same as the word for “immortality’ and references a life without death or the continuation of life beyond the grave."". This can further be connected to AoT, Eren and the tree which connects all Eldians at the Path.  
Also the song keeps bringing back the word ""repeat"" as well at the end of multiple verses, reminding us of repetitions and cycles. So adding this all to the mixture of an endless loop theory does further strengthen the case.  
And I haven't even added the posibility of reincarnation or other symbols from the story and song to the equation.  
Who knows maybe this is all going a bit too far, but then again it could also mean that the whole universe of AoT raises a simple question like:  
Which was first, the chicken or the egg?  
One last idea of mine is that if the creature is called the source of all living matter, that would also include humanity as a whole, which in the context of an infinite loop would mean that not only Eldians are connected, but also the rest of humanity. It's just that Eldians had been chosen in a similar matter the royal bloodline must have been chosen (possibly by the source of all living matter, Ymir or Eren) between Eldians. Because if all Eldians are descendants of Yimir, techinically everyone should be part of the royal bloodline. In any case, the source of all living matter was and will always be the beginning and end. (Although I think of it more like a parasite in need of a host, than a creature that can think or has its own will for anything other than survival.)

I just want to start this post by revealing a little about me, since it's going to be a long one. 

I'm a long-term lurker of here and a day one fan of the manga. I am an American-born, first generation Japanese immigrant who moved back to Tokyo in 2010 to study. Since getting into the manga, I've gone to and graduated from animation school. Currently I do work as an animator and storyboard artist in the anime industry, though I cannot reveal which studios I've worked for nor which one currently employs me. Suffice it to say I've been shuffled in and out of a few well-known animation studios. That said I am not claiming that anything I am about to say is first-hand knowledge, but rather based on my experience in the industry. 

I'm also going to apologize in advance for the length of this post lol

Currently I'm on (unpaid, of course) leave from work in Tokyo and visiting family in America. The other day I was hanging out with some old friends from high school when we sat down to watch the newest episode of 進撃の巨人. Personally, I'm a fairweather fan of MAPPA as a studio. Generally they are well-admired for their work advancing CGI as an industry standard and for their meticulous attention to detail. Being a part of the machine kind of disillusions you from the idea of idolizing any given studio for their work because of the largely collaborative nature of making an anime and the rather soul-crushing realization that most productions are dictated by media conglomerates and committees rather than any sort of autonomy from studios or creators. 

What stunned me is the extremely critical banter that occurred from second one of the show coming on the TV. To be honest the majority of anime fans in Japan are more than used to the idea that a studio that is working under a tight timeframe and being crunched to produce results will produce inconsistent work during its airing and clean things up for home media release. But the absolute tirade of vitriol spewed by my old friends during the course of the episode frankly began to hurt me as if I had personally worked on the show. I'm not saying animation is above criticism, but a lot of this was simply unreasonable. I couldn't enjoy the episode- and frankly barely took in anything I saw- because of it. Meanwhile, watching the show in Japan with my friends is a completely opposite experience- not that I'm saying it avoids criticism there.

What I intend to do here is not to ""defend"" MAPPA's work on this season in any specific sense. I think it's quite clear that there are things are fell under MAPPA's radar when trying to get this thing out in a timely manner and some of their decisions on cuts and pacing are strange. But what I would like to do is dispel some common misconceptions I've seen here and on r/attackontitan. 

**Studio WIT's Work and Relationship with Isayama**

* I see Studio WIT consistently upheld as superior to MAPPA. I can assure you that, while there is some massive industry talent in WIT, they are just as consistent as any other studio. (**EDIT:** I am referring to the quality of their animation, not the overall output of the studio- meaning they also have multiple consistency errors during airing whcih get fixed in home video release) They've had their ups and downs- and the hills and valleys are fairly average for a studio. What's interesting about comparing WIT's work to MAPPA directly is that most of what I see are direct comparisons between season 3 of 進撃の巨人 to season 4. This is *patently absurd*. WIT had years to perfect their relationship to the characters and setting, and their work was widely panned in season one. It is only after a very long adjustment that ""peak 進撃の巨人"" was achieved. You cannot compare a studio's final work on an intellectual property that they've chipped away at for more than half a decade to a studio's first crack at said property. My personal opinion is that their work on 進撃の巨人 is beautiful- if mostly for their heavy lines and *excellent* use of color and lighting.
* Studio WIT's relationship with Isayama is ***bog standard*** when adapting an ongoing manga. Another bit of fandom mythology I've seen here and elsewhere is that Isayama and WIT had some extraordinarily synergestic relationship never before seen in the industry. That simply isn't true. As far as I can find in my research on both the US and Japanese web, the extent of WIT's relationship with Isayama was to ask what was going to happen in future chapters. I cannot stress how often this happens across other properties. The idea that the two worked closely together seems to hold no water. Yes, Isayama's character design seems to have evolved alongside the anime. This has happened with plenty of ongoing manga as well and it's no more special of a process than the mangaka watching the adaptation unfold and going, ""Huh. I hadn't thought to do this or that."" It seems that Isayama has disengaged from the property at this point, but let's be clear: MAPPA's lack of foresight on the manga's ending is purely a result of the pressure put on both their studio and Isayama.
* This will be revisited later, but let's not forget that Studio WIT's work on season 3 was so excellent in part because they were granted time to ~~it~~ perfect their relationship to the material (edited for clarity) and because of *intense* fan backlash that cascaded into a situation wherein WIT felt they could no longer pursue their own interests as a studio on original properties *and* work under Kodansha's timeline *and* continue to field harassment from fans. Let's be clear: this essentially makes WIT's withdrawal from 進撃の巨人 partially the fault of fans. However, with fans still demanding a completed adaptation of their favorite manga...

**Kodansha Created a Toxic Work Environment by Introducing Unreasonable Timelines**

* This is also a sadly common story in the industry. Without WIT, Kodansha and the 進撃の巨人 Committee searched without much luck for a replacement studio. Eventually, MAPPA was chosen to fill these shoes. I'm not encouraging you to take this as law, but a friend of mine works for MAPPA and was present during the acquisition of this property. Excitement swept the studio when it was announed, however it was quickly quashed when Kodansha only granted them a *year* to get from pre- to post- production. For context, WIT was granted nearly two. Pretty much any anime hailed as having beautiful animation is granted two to three years. This *is*, however, the typical timeline granted for Toei projects (*Dragon Ball Super*, *Sailor Moon Crystal* etc.) so do with that what you will. This directly affected how MAPPA was forced to handle this situation, which was inevitably the dreaded chop (tracing frames from other studio anime) and crunch. (I trust you all are familiar with this) I would say this also has something to do with MAPPA falling back on character designs that hew closer to their other work. 

Finally, 

**MAPPA's Efforts Were Cut off at the Knees from the Start**

* So, just think about this: you have to continue an anime which has only *just finally* gained the approval of its fanbase, you know that you need to do something similar-but-different because of the tonal shift, you have to *conclude* a show with a rabid fanbase *and* you have to get it out the door in a year. You have to admit this is not enviable work. 
* The backlash was immediate- it took almost no time for MAPPA employees to be harassed on Twitter by 進撃の巨人 fans. This is conjecture, but I have to imagine this affecting one's work when they have their bosses constantly on their back, working long unpaid hours and then opening up their phones to see their lives being threatened because of the- let's be clear- *cartoon* that they work on. 
* Along with WIT, many longtime collaborators of the show left. This has clearly affected the OST and the continuity of certain details. 
* Despite this, MAPPA still delivered a show that is far more detailed than your average pump-and-dump show with the budget and timeframe allotted them and retaining elements of the manga's design, though admittedly different elements than WIT's. Blu-Rays have largely fixed a lot of the issues that fans had with the design and animation during airing as well, but this doesn't seem to factor in to the criticism they receive. WIT did this as well, importantly. 
* CGI is expensive and takes time to properly mesh, texture and animate. MAPPA is doing a balancing act between budget and time on this particularly aspect of the show and to be honest I still think it looks better on a technical level than anything that came before it. WIT used it more sparingly, which is a choice for sure. And maybe MAPPA shouldn't have made that choice, but it is consistent with their reputation as a studio. 

This is all simply to say that fandom harassment is not helpful. Your favorite manga is getting a *completed* anime production, which is more than many can say, with involvement from two studios lauded by the industry. As someone who has worked under similar conditions to MAPPA's crunch efforts, I have to say the anger from the fan base is being- as it usually is- directed to the exact wrong place. MAPPA is not a bad studio- they are far from it, in fact. This is obvious from watching nearly any other work. Your anger and ire should be directed at Kodansha and the work culture of the anime industry in general. While it is work that I love, the control that publishers, IP holders and broadcast companies exert over the ""art"" aspect of the industry is positively dystopian. 

I think it's incredible that this fandom is doing work to animate and adapt the manga in its own ways, but hopefully this effort cultivates a better understanding of the people you are putting under your heel when you yell, ""F\*\*\* MAPPA!"".

Yes you read that right. I feel the need to make this post because quite a number of people haven't noticed it yet. I'll make an effort to condense my thoughts as best as I can.

**tldr;** We'll finally see Eren's POV where he'll show his aces. He'll reveal how he's using the WH to make contact with his daughter back on Paradis. His daughter will be OG Ymir who will inherit the beast. He'll hold his daughter and say ""you're free"", reactivating the rumbling as they make contact. The devil spine will be destroyed, freeing the shifters from Ymir's curse and ending the power of the titans. The alliance will all die (my theory is they all fall to their deaths - it's more poetic).

**1)** **Where is Eren's POV?**

Every single time we aren't shown a shifter's POV, it means a twist is coming.

Examples:

1. Armin vs Bertholdt, Eren's POV is the only one of the three not shown. Yams didn't forget to include him, he was leaving a decoy body to get the drop on Bertholdt.
2. Eren vs Ms. Tybur, we aren't shown the WH's POV because the twist is the remote nape ability.
3. We aren't shown the POV of any shifter yet to be revealed - Jacked Titan is Eren, Female titan is Annie, Beast shown in Season 2 episode 1 is Zeke, the list goes on.

The point is that we haven't seen Eren's POV in many chapters because a twist is coming. There just isn't enough pages for the alliance to counter Eren's grandmaster plan, so they will lose.

**2) Why was Eren so fixated on getting the Warhammer Titan?**

So far Eren has used the WH twice:

1. Break out of prison
2. Against Marley's counterattack (that he didn't even know about)

He's likely using the founder to create and control the titans of the past. Basically, he hasn't shown us WHY he wanted the WH so bad. I agree with many of the theories floating around about how Eren is using the WH's remote-nape ability with the founding titan. I was originally suspecting his body (below head) to be somewhere else on the founder, but given this chapter he might *actually* be back on Paradis. Keep in mind in Chapter 119, steam was covering the lower part of the founder as it was forming so we couldn't see Eren's body (below the head).

**3) How can Eren win if the Rumbling has been stopped?**

When I read ""the alliance stops the rumbling"" in the leaks, I suspected that the wall titans would just stop moving and ***not*** fall over and die. The chapter confirms my suspicion. To me, the fact that there are millions of wall titans just standing around is confirmation that they'll continue their march once the twist happens. Eren's using the WH to achieve the twist in one of three ways:

1. His body (below the head) is still on Paradis and he's running a long cable the same as the WH titan. He'll go to pick up his child, and once he's holding his child he'll say ""You're free"". The rumbling will continue and destroy the rest of the world.
2. The founder is amplifying the WH's remote-nape ability so he can no longer needs the cable - it's upgraded to be ""wireless"". His lower body is still on Paradis and he'll reform a new head. He'll restart the rumbling by holding his child as stated in possibility 1.
3. I think this one is the least likely since it's not as impactful and seems more like an ass-pull but I'll entertain it nonetheless. His lower body is on the founder and he'll connect with his daughter through paths using the WH amplified by the Founder (before losing it) to achieve the rumbling. This isn't nearly as poetic as the first two points though.

Everyone is expecting Eren to win, which is why he's being setup to lose. Just look at this subreddit, everyone is raging because they believe Isayama is writing a cliche ending.

1. RUMBLING OP

So i think everybody at this point has noticed the dead butterfly at the end of the OP

well,its a fact that eren is represented as a bird and not a butterfly,so who is the butterfly here?

Besides eren cannot be the butterfly at the end of the OP,the OP is from his POV,his collosal titans,if we go by the logic that its eren then it means that eren is stepping on himself,that's just dumb

Now as for the butterfly at the end of the OP i found the exact same butterfly,

Ok,that's it for now,i will make another post but for now please don't kill me for this,

As for the Ending Defenders who say that this ED also parallels to mikasa's ED,you all are 100% correct,its just that we have found more parallels and similarities in lyrics and visuals for AnR ED,

Also the reason is because (inside info) that there is a major change in chapter 123 and possibly 130 for the anime which will finally make sense for eren's ED to parallel to both mikasa ED and historia's ED,

Ymir's love was ew no. But the fact that Eren was never ever free is just soo painful and perfect! It's just that it's soo sudden and then he dumps all his intentions on Ymir, saying that it was her doing. Then if it was Ymir's doing then a little more panels showing Ymir's life would've been nice, just so we can be more connected to her and then we can feel like yeah we get it.

Like many of you, I enjoyed most of the series in the anime & manga but felt the final chapter did not deliver in certain areas. Particularly the cringey Eren crying panel, forever one of the all time worst panels in manga history.

It helps that the anime sandwiches that moment between some of the best scenes in the series. I really liked the final episode, and I was hoping for AoE as much as most of you. But imo, the anime really hammered down how unhinged Eren was in the cringey scene. Yes it still takes out ALL the character development of badass s4 genocidal villain Eren, but the anime made it more palatable and meaningful for me. I liked Eren calling himself an idiot with power, war certainly feels like it’s conducted on the basest of impulses.

Idt I’ll ever like that Eren has a complete 180 on his standoffish relationship with mikasa during that scene, but again the anime made this moment better to me.

1. Eren’s ’For 10 years at least’ speech
I’m not one of those people that hate when a character isn’t a stoic badass. But I believe there is a sharp contrast between Eren’s Ch 131 breakdown and his Ch 139 breakdown. Eren crying in front of Ramzi is depicted super well, and we as the audience feel for him, especipally how it’s spliced between scenes of the thousands of innocents being slaughtered. Obviously he would be devastated over being forced to destroy humanity, being extremely depressed over it. However, him breaking down to Armin makes no sense for his character. Whenever we’ve seen Eren cry, it’s usually over his loved ones or his failure to save them (his Mom, Hannes, Armin S3), but this moment is none of that. Instead, he cry’s over a woman that he has shown only slight romantic attachments towards (despite most of the show he yells at her, hits her, treats her like shit, and at many times seems to only like her as a sister). I honestly believe this scene was made to humiliate eren, being further supported by Armin’s comment on how pathetic what he just said was

2. Annie not facing any punishment:
I think Annie had the potential to be a very interesting character, having her story be having to make amends for doing those terrible things back in S1, especially to Levi’s squad. Instead of having that, her character instead has zero remorse to her actions, doesn’t apologize to anyone, and is instead thrown in so Armin can have some cheap, last-minute romantic tension. Everyone else kind of just forgets her action (like Connie laughing at her for eating pie, even though the last time he saw her she had a human yo-yo)

3. Eren’s motives switching;
The whole point of Eren’s character was that he was a symbol of hope to others. No matter what anyone told him, no matter what happened, he almost always stayed determined to keep moving forward to reach his goal of freedom. Throughout the entire series he pursued freedom. First it was to free the world of titans and free himself from the guilt of his mother dying. Then it became the freedom to explore the outside world. Then the freedom to live without fear of being exterminated from the outside world. Throughout the entirety of season 4, up until the final few episodes, Eren’s goal was to activate the rumbling to keep the people of Paradis safe from genocide. This unfortunately came at the cost of commuting his own genocide, but it showed how far he’d go for freedom. This idea that he was just acting the entire time, even in his internal monologues is such a total retcon and is a slap in the face to anyone who understood his character. When Armin begs Eren to stop in the paths, Eren saying that it’s already predetermined implies that everything in the show is being influenced, and Eren has no choice, meaning Eren was never free. Him being perfectly fine with that makes no sense, as he is not the type of character to give up

4. Historia being sidelined
Historia is one of the best female characters in AOT. Her growth from being a scared girl afraid tho choose sides, who wouldn’t mind dying if she was told, to a determined leader and queen is amazing writing. Her and Ymir’s relationship is one of the best in anime history in my opinion. However, Historia is completely ruined at the end. Most of the story, she is set up to be a direct parallel to the founder Ymir. Having Mikasa be the important one makes no sense character-wise, as the only thing the two have in common is loving someone who doesn’t love them back (at least until it was revealed that Eren did love Mikasa). Instead, Historia just becomes a figure head, allowing herself to have the child of some random nobody, and have her character do absolutely nothing.

5. Having the Story Be a Loop
Eren stopped at 80% because he wanted the other 20 to view his friends as saviors for stopping him (this plan is already flawed, but not so terrible). Showing that Paradis was destroyed by the outside world years later anyway means that Eren’s plan was completely useless, also making the Rumbling unnecessary. That’s not to say that having Paradis get destroyed is bad, but it could’ve been written much better (I’ll explain how at the end). Showing that child come across the tree implies he’ll become the next Ymir. This means that everything in the story will start over, and they will be stuck in an endless loop.

What I would’ve done
Obviously, many people like how the show ended. I’m not claiming to be a better author than Isyama and despite my disliking of the ending, the fact he was able to write 130 chapters of absolute peak is amazing.

Firstly, Eren is tThe father of Historia’s child. This wasn’t done out of romantic interest (historia will always love Ymir, and Eren will always love Mikasa) but out of necessity to keep Historia from becoming a Titan. Eren goes through with the rumbling 100%. Floch and Hange still die, and nearly all of Eren’s friends hate him for what he’s done. He still gets rid of their Titan power. Even Mikasa, who loves Eren, still can’t forgive him for his atrocity and leaves him behind. This and Historia’s child being born break the curse of Ymir. Eren lives away from everyone else, with only Historia occasionally visiting him, understanding what it’s like to be the worst in the world. 

Eventually, Paradis does get destroyed, but it’s due to an inner conflict, still getting across the fact that the cycle of war will never end, while also being an irony. The civil war causes all of humanity to perish, but Eren and his friends during their time were still free",True,False,titanfolk,What I disliked about the AOT Ending,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/17p8hv5/what_i_disliked_about_the_aot_ending/

 Although the covers themselves may just have been a coincidence. The scene below practically proves the 13 birds falling reprsent 13 members of the alliance who are going to die.

Here we see only 12 birds flying instead of 13. The one bird missing is sasha who just died on the airship the birds are flying next to.

This still might all be a coincidence but since the opening is symbolizing all the alliance members as birds who will die its becoming more likely that Isayama planned two endings and that ch 139 may not have been a retcon.

 Highly recomend u check out [r/ANRime](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANRime/), subreddit for aoe theories. There was a post made revealing a panel from 139 was included in the season 4 op (source:[https://www.reddit.com/r/ANRime/comments/oai7f1/in\_the\_manga\_this\_is\_one\_of\_the\_few\_locations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ANRime/comments/oai7f1/in_the_manga_this_is_one_of_the_few_locations/)) 

Mappa has confirmed that animation on season 4 part 2 started in oct of 2020. Now i may be wrong but animation can only begin once all the episodes have been written and scripted. Yuki Kaji also mentioned in an interview in december that he had called isayama for advice on the script, during that phone call kaji said that isayama was in a meeting discussing the final episode. If animation started in oct this meeting might have taken place a month or two before. 

Before the pandemic Yams and Kodansha orginally planned to release 139 a few weeks before the last episode. From a business pov this doesnt make any sense, the anime is there to promote the manga having the manga end before the anime is weird. If both the manga and anime had the same ending then no one would buy the chapter, having two different endings that are connected would not only bring in more manga sales but anime-onlies would most likely buy the manga if they knew it ended differently. 

But because of the pandemic there is now almost a year long gap between ch 139 and season 4 part 2. This might be one of the reasons yams drew the 8 pages, everyone including the editors thought that the additional pages would only provide some additional context not change the entire ending. Ch 139 was extremely popular in japan so why add 8 pages that literally retcon the themes of the ending. You could agrue the addition of the 8 pages affected the vol 34 sales. Some say the pages were a set up for a sequel but kodansha had an interview beginning of july stating that there is no sequel planned for aot. The 8 pages were meant to show that Erens failed his two goals, protect paradise and eliminate the titans. 

Besides showing erens failure the additional pages also provide a explanation on how eren can reset the timeline. The last page shows a boy heading into the tree where erens founding titan remains. Once the kid comes into contact with the founding he will gain all 9 titan powers including the attack titan, meaning there is an attack titan after eren. Paths eren would have seen the boy's memories of paradise being destroyed and send the those memories to his father to convince him to give the titans to 10 year old eren. Paths eren would then send the manga timeline memories back to his younger self which we see in ep 1 in the anime to ensure that anime eren would complete the rumbling.

25. Children Of The Forest - 9.12/9.6/8.4 --> 9.04


Some quick notes here: these scores keep fluctuating (especially serializd), but generally speaking the top 5 is pretty rock solid and doesn't change much. Neither does the top 10 really. 

Also, something cool is that Hero is usually in the top 5 highest rated episodes of ALL TIME NOT JUST ANIME, fluctuating between 6th place and tying for 1st place. It often competes with Everybody's Waiting (Six Feet Under), Victory and Death( Clone Wars), Sozin's Comet 4, (ATLA), Ozymandias and Felina (Breaking Bad). These are almost always the top 6.

Hero is also the highest rated anime episode of all time, followed closely by the Kaguya Sama Season 3 finale, then Hunterx Hunter episode 131, then Assault and 2000 Years Ago as the top 5  highest rated anime episodes.


The Major  Arcs ratings were based on the average episode rating, which wasn't a perfect way to do it but a pretty solid one imo.

1. Return To Shiganshina - 9.46/9.67/8.51 --> 9.21

2. Marley - 8.98/9.40/8.40 --> 8.93

3. War For Paradis - 8.90/9.35/8.28 --> 8.84

4. Rumbling - 8.8/9.28/8.43 --> 8.84

5. Clash Of The Titans - 8.62/9.12/8.07 --> 8.60

6. Uprising - 8.66/9.07/7.94 --> 8.56

7. Female Titan - 8.44/8.91/8.17 --> 8.51

8. Trost - 8.20/8.72/8.07 --> 8.33


There are three main things I would like to add here. 

1. Jesus CHRIST the improvement. It is not just something that is hyped up by fans; the show really did shoot up in audience acclaim after the RTS arc and never let up.

2. The Final Chapters Special 1 was weighted as three episodes due to its length being roughly that much, which ended up SIGNIFICANTLY boosting the rumbling Arcs overall score. If I just weighted it as 1 episode it would still be in 4th place but with an average score of 8.69  instead. Regardless though, the arc seems to be highly regarded by fans so we can basically disregard all the discourse that this arc is in any way ""divisive"" - the only real divisive thing was the ending. This also proves another post I did about the overall reception of the rumbling arc chapter by chapter, and how the anime only improved on it. However, keep in mind that this arc is NOT FINISHED and might go down after the release of the final episode, especially since it will also have the 3x weighting behind it.

3.  War For Paradis and Marley are brought down a bit because they feature both buildup and the payoff in them, while RTS is pretty much all payoff and rides off other Arcs that did the buildup for it, which gives it an advantage when it comes to ratings and consistency. 

If we took only the last 9 episodes of s4p2, for instance, which were considered by many to indeed be the payoff episodes and omit the 4 early ones, its score would be:

9.16/9.59/8.34 --> 9.03

Still lower than RTS but did definitely enjoy a ratings boost that probably more accurately reflects the fan bases views on the arc since they  generally value  the payoff more in their enjoyment. 

However, this ""disadvantage"" for WFP and Marley is not at all to say that the insanely high rating of Return To Shiganshina was in any way undeserved - it has that rating for a reason and according to a recent r/snk consensus survey, it still got the most votes by far as people's favorite arc of the series.",False,False,AttackOnRetards,I looked at three major user rating sources and used them to rank the top 25 OVERALL highest rated episodes and all the arcs.,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/11vk0nb/i_looked_at_three_major_user_rating_sources_and/

**Episode 1 - Judgment:** Cold open with the remainder of **Chapter 115**. We then see **Chapter 117** play out ending with Zeke’s return.

**Episode 2 - Sneak Attack:** **Chapter 118** + a small portion of **Chapter 119**. [I can see this panel being a good ending point.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935126022_f954e63250_o.png)

**Episode 3 - Two Brothers:** Alright, I’m starting to lose my hopium that we’re gonna see anime onlies experience the 119 cliffhanger and hear me out, it’s probably best for the pacing. I truly can’t think of a scenario that either isn’t rushed or sluggish in order to get that.

**Episode 5 - From You, 2000 Years Ago:** This episode’s structure seems to be the most concrete in terms of the leaks. We’ll be seeing the remainder of **Chapter 121** + **Chapter 122** + Eren’s speech at the end of **Chapter 123**. If this ends up being true, it’s basically a lock for the GOAT episode.

**Episode 6 - Island Devils:** **Chapter 123** flashback scenes + [124 up until this point](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935025006_f7c1224211_o.jpg). Ending with a sendoff to our big brained king Pyxis would be a cool way to finish this one. I think it’s gonna be kind of weird to see Annie’s dad again yet not her reveal but I don’t know how they’d cram that into one episode.

**Episode 7 - Sunset:** Cold open with the rest of [Chapter 124 until this panel](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50934339433_7a5548ccaa_o.jpg). This would be the long awaited Annie-centric episode that would adapt the rest of **Chapter 124** and culminate to ending with our famous pie scene in **Chapter 125.** The second half of the episode will adapt the rest of 125.

EDIT 12/25: I got the pie scene mixed up with the 126, I’m the least confident in eps 6 & 7 as I think they’ll have by far the most restructuring.

**Episode 8 - Pride:** **Chapter 126**, rumored to have it’s own episode. This one’s pretty wordy and could benefit from some slower pacing.

**Episode 9 - End’s Eve:** **Chapter 127**, another very dialogue heavy episode. 

**Episode 10 - Traitor:** **Chapter 128** + **Chapter 129** + [small portion of Chapter 130.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935042361_22c20cef77_o.jpg)

**Episode 11 - The Rumbling:** **Chapter 130** + [Chapter 131 up until this point.](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50935166837_0764fa3f7a_o.jpg) I can see this one not having an intro and minimal OST, this would be another legendary episode.

**Episode 12 - Wings of Freedom:** The remainder of **Chapter 131** + **Chapter 132**. The current rumor seems to be a 130-131 ending but I genuinely believe a 132 ending makes the most sense for a season finale. We give a key character a final sendoff and the alliance takes off for Eren.

Taking everything he said at face value can make his thoughts, motivations and actions seem contradictory to the reader.

The main example of this is the infamous *""I don't know why""* panel where Eren answers Armin's question on why he wanted to do the rumbling even if he didn't have his future memories. People claim this proves that Eren didn't have plans nor motivations and did the Rumbling just because for no apparent reason.

The thing is, this is not true. There is actually a very important subtext in that panel that people often miss and it's not meant to be taken literally as it is the core to understanding Eren as a character.

[ Infamous chapter 139 panel](https://preview.redd.it/fpwvqtx4hgg81.png?width=2250&format=png&auto=webp&s=cec7f5aad474f1ad54677dc4c3bd0c7d589f2025)

Eren knows precisely the reasons why he did the Rumbling and they were explicitly stated throughout his flashbacks and even at the beginning of 139:

1. He wanted to end the titan curse as he saw it in his future memories,
2. He wanted to rumble the world in order to protect Paradis and his friends,
3. Because he needed to die in order to accomplish his 1. goal and therefore couldn't fully complete his 2. goal he tried to compromise by destroying as much of the world as he can and making his friends into the heroes who stopped him in order to give them a chance to achieve peace by acting as representatives in the same manner as Tyburs did.

Those are all his genuine goals and motives but underneath all of that, his deepest motivation for the Rumbling was because he was disappointed that his ultimate dream of freedom from Armin's book is impossible after finding out the state of the world, so he wanted to wipe it clean as his initial dream turned to hatred and desperation.

He doesn't want to admit that to Armin in their farewell talk which is why his answer was indirect, and there really was no need for Isayama to repeat himself to the reader in the last chapter as we already knew all of this from chapter 131.

The root cause of this and why Eren wanted to do everything he did is because since birth it was in his nature to always seek freedom and since he was born into this world he felt it was his right to be free. He felt caged, first by the titans that were keeping him inside the walls, then by his realization about the world and humanity outside the walls and finally by the very nature of Eldians being chained to the Founder and the paths. Because of this feeling, in his desperation, he was drawn towards the Rumbling in order to finally feel free by destroying all the walls he thought that caged him.

What Eren actually meant with his answer to Armin is that he doesn't really know why he felt like that, why the Rumbling made him feel free, why is freedom that important to him and why is that his nature not that he didn't know why he rumbled the world. The assumed final panel with Grisha telling him he is free shown while Eren tells his answer to Armin serves precisely to confirm this interpretation and show the intention Isayama had with this scene.

There is actually a direct parallel to this scene even down to his face expression in chapter 121 when Zeke asks Eren why does he moves forward even if Grisha didn't brainwash him and Eren simply answers - *""I am just me, I always have been""*.

[ Parallel chapter 121 panel](https://preview.redd.it/uhgphwk6hgg81.jpg?width=1066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e80aebf67fda929a551c8dffa26238f2758c19ff)

In both of these scenes Eren doesn't give a direct answer to the question asked but instead contemplates his innate nature and deeper drive for freedom which pushed him towards the Rumbling and fulfilling his childhood dream of finally feeling completely free, at least temporarily.

If you are not convinced by now that Eren is answering the same question in both of those scenes and is giving the same answer, the anime absolutely drives this point home with the addition of the *""You are free""* panel from Eren's and Armin's talk in 139 during the scene where Zeke asks him his question in episode 79.

[ \\""You are free\\"" panel from episode 79 ](https://preview.redd.it/sxemp0l7hgg81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b27a6da85fbba5cd8415d36b295b8abc6b5caa)

Hopefully this helps people who were confused by his quote in 139 to gain some insight into the subtext there as it is the key to understanding Eren's core motivations and more importantly Isayama's themes and intentions with Eren's character.

One of the main themes Isayama wanted to portray in the manga is the ***nature*** **vs** ***nurture*** **debate** \- whether it's the environment and upbringing or biology and genetics that determine a person's personality, behavior, motivations, goals and ultimately fate. And in the manga we have examples of characters for both of those standpoints.

There is an [interesting interview with Isayama](https://fuku-shuu.tumblr.com/post/162652398937/snk-news-isayama-hajimes-bessatsu-shonen-august) where he elaborates on this theme and his motivations for Attack on Titan ending:

>Ultimately, I don’t think the series passes judgment on what is “right”  or “wrong.” For example, when I read Furuya Minoru’s “Himeanole,” I knew  society would consider the serial killer in the story unforgivable  under social norms. But when I took into account his life and background  I still wondered, “If this was his nature, then who is to blame…?” I  even thought, “Is it merely coincidence that I wasn’t born as a  murderer?” We justify what we absolutely cannot accomplish as “a flaw  due to lack of effort,” and there is bitterness within that. On the  other hand, for a perpetrator, having the mindset of “It’s not because I  lack effort that I became like this” is a form of solace. We cannot  deny that under such circumstances, the victims’ feelings are very  important. But considering the root of the issue, rather than evaluating  “what is right”…to be influenced by various other works and their  philosophies, and to truthfully illustrate my exact feelings during  those moments - I think that’s what *Shingeki no Kyojin*’s ending will resemble.

Zeke is a prime example of nurture being the dominant factor in his character. Zeke's whole ideology as well as his motivations and his plan came from his environment - Marley's oppression, Grisha's and Dina's upbringing and indoctrination, Ksaver's encouragement. All of those factors resulted in Zeke's nihilistic point of view about the world and Eldians.

But in his talk with Armin in 137 we see that his innermost sincere desire was not something he would achieve with his grandiose plans for the world but just a desire to play catch with a father figure and be happy in those small moments.

Eren on the other hand is a total opposite. Even before all the terrible events that happened to him - destruction of the walls, the tragedies and betrayals that he experienced which no doubt contributed to his motivations and goals, his innermost drive to always seek freedom was present even when he was living in peace and had a wonderful childhood and upbringing without pressure.

Eren's belief is in a way an upgrade to Carla's that just by being born you are special. He believes that ultimate freedom is inherent right of every human being just by birth, and because he is born in this world he will make his right a reality and do everything he can to achieve that freedom even if it leads him to self-destruction. Eren is therefore the main example of innate nature being the determining factor and that is the core of his motivation.

This can also be seen in his parallel with Reiner - Eren recognizes that they are the same because the core of their motivation is selfish (for Reiner to be a respected hero and for Eren to achieve his ultimate feeling of freedom) even if the rest of their goals and reasons are also true and important (for Reiner to survive and make life easier for his family and for Eren to protect his friends, save Paradis and end the titan curse).

Even with all of this said, Eren was still a human and I think during the last arc he used the belief that he was simply born that way and that there was no other way as a form of solace in order to ease his guilty conscience. After reaching that scenery and achieving his ideal freedom for at least a moment, what was left of his humanity was broken by the pressure and guilt of all of the people he killed, so he allowed the Alliance to pursue him because deep down he wanted to be stopped.

In the end, in order to accomplish his other goals he gave up on his personal impossible dream and died so that at least his friends and loved ones could experience the freedom he had been seeking his whole life.",False,False,AttackOnRetards,"I don't know why - Chapter 121, 139 and Episode 79 parallels, nature vs nurture themes",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/smxett/i_dont_know_why_chapter_121_139_and_episode_79/

1) Since they left out the season this time, does this means it will very likely only be released in one of the coming seasons after the winter? It feels like that to me.  


2) Since they didn't announce it as episode 88 does this also means this opens further the possibility of not being the usual format of 24 minute episodes and actually longer special episodes? Or is this a big stretch and will most likely be just normal episodes?  


3) Also, if it is a normal cour, how weird is for anime to have a season of 7, 8 or 9 episodes? (speculating it would be max 9 episodes if no original content is added) Like, I imagine it is possible, but I don't thin I have seen an anime have ever to have those amount of episodes. But S3P2 cour had 10 episosdes which I think is already unusual by itself.

  
I think if 1) is right, which seems to me it is, it would actually be a really good thing. We already had a Part 2 with mostly really high quality (despite some people that will always argue against Mappa) and if the anime is actually returning Spring season or later, this means they will have even more time than  between P1 and P2 to animate less content in P3 compared to P2. They animated 14 chapters entirely \[117\~130\] + a part of ch115 in P2 vs 9 chapters they have left to anime P3. This makes me believe we will have a pretty well animated and good looking Rumbling (same or higher quality than what we have seen so far) and pretty well animated Battle of Heaven and Earth, after seeing how the port battle looked like.   


Also, if they were going to add some original battle scenes, be creative with some parts and even add some dialogue closer to the end, expand on something, this also looks really good for it. Isayama is working more with the anime than he ever was since the manga ended and he is not busy with the manga anymore + there will be 2 years since the end of the manga when part 3 returns. Not saying that he is obligated or he should be doing, but I don't think it is absurd to expect he could be writing some small extra stuff to add there. And in this case, the time gap really helps.

I’ll be honest, I don’t think I like Attack on Titan’s fourth season. Itrs a widely shared opinion, but I want to express it in a more personal way, based on my own feelings. Many will argue that this season is objectively flawless, that the ending is perfect due to its symbolism and deeper meaning. But in the end, that doesn’t change the fact that I didn’t enjoy it as much as I should have.

For context, I discovered Attack on Titan in 2020, during the pandemic, while revisiting anime like Naruto and Death Note. I watched it with no spoilers and no real idea of the story, letting myself be surprised by every twist and revelations and I loved it. The post-apocalyptic setting, the equal treatment of male and female characters, the incredible storytelling and animation, all of it was fascinating. However, even back then, I noticed something that bothered me. Unlike anime like Assassination Classroom or Naruto, where every character had a well-developed background and a natural evolution, AoT‘s early episodes introduced characters that felt somewhat stereotypical, making their narrative arcs seem predictable. I donrt mind tropes, and I was pleasantly surprised by some characters (like Eren), but for the majority, I struggled to feel engaged in their individual developments. This for long was an issue because since they all could die fast anyway, I wasn’t invested in those characters, not moved at all. Still, it was there, and over the first three seasons, I followed them with interest and was rewarded with some great moments, especially with characters like Armin, Jean, Erwin, Levi, and Hange.

I absolutely loved the first three seasons, though I did have one main issue: Mikasars development. It seemed to start strong in the Trost arc but ultimately led nowhere. Season 3 could have worked as an open ending, but of course, it wasnet a true conclusion to the story, so I eagerly awaited season 4. At the time, the manga was still ongoing, with one chapter released each month, so while the wait was long, I was able to read most of season 4 before catching up to the monthly releases. The drastic shift in setting and the introduction of new characters was shocking, but in a good way. It felt like an opportunity to push these characters narratives further, making them more than just well-executed but somewhat generic arcs. I was convinced that that was where things were headed.

At that time, I was fully on Paradis side. I wasn’t particularly interested in the world beyond Paradis, and I saw its hostility as a product of ignorance. However, I was a huge hater of Eren, and season 4 only reinforced that. I despised the Yeagerists and opposed Eren‘s plan to wipe out the world. My attachment to certain characters shaped my perspective on the story, and that‘s probably why this season left me so disappointed. I didn‘t have a specific ending in mind, but the one we got didn’t satisfy me.

Take Armin, for example. He was built up as the savior of humanity. I never took that phrase literally, but it was emphasized multiple times, even by Eren in the final episode. Yet, I don’t see how Armin actually made a difference. As I read through season 4, I felt like the brilliant, resourceful Armin was disappearing. I assumed the author was saving his best moment for the finale, but in the end, nothing. Every plan he came up with in this season, except for the attack on Liberio, which he wasn’t even alone for, failed miserably, and it was always a plot device moment that saved them each time. His sudden decision to trust Eren in Shiganshina, based purely on intuition, felt absurd to me. There was no real evidence that Eren shared any of his ideals, so I couldn’t understand his reasoning. Yes, Armin has always relied on intuition, but in previous seasons, his instincts were grounded in logical deductions. Here, it felt like blind faith.

Mikasa’s case is different. She was my favorite character, and ironically, I hated Eren. The only thing I expected from her was to kill him. And she did, but it left me feeling nothing. After seasons of her blindly following him, I wanted her to take a strong stance, to confront Eren ideologically, the way many other charactersers, especially the male ones, did. But even in that crucial moment, she remained passive. Their final conversation was frustrating; so much could have been said between them. If Isayama wanted to push the idea of a romantic connection, this was the perfect moment to subtly develop it before Eren’s final revelation but nothing came of it. She spent four years by his side, and in the end, she simply accepted his death and let him go. I don’t see that as a courageous or heroic choice because, ultimately, she sacrificed nothing. She got the confirmation she wanted and allowed Eren to die.

As for the other characters, many of their arcs felt like they led to nothing. Jean, for instance, had a compelling buildup in the first three seasons, but his story never really reached a meaningful conclusion. This applies to most of the characters, actually the only one who felt like she had a truly satisfying arc was Gabi.

Then there is Eren. I have mixed feelings about him. I don’t hate him anymore, but I still don’t like him (as a person I meant, his character is good and actually relatable sometimes). My main issue is that his character feels impossible to define. Every time I see long Reddit posts trying to analyze him, they always have to create some timeline or speculative explanation to justify certain inconsistencies. I often see people say that he changed his mind between different decisions or way of thinking, but this is never explicitly or implicitly addressed in the story, it’s all just fan interpretation. That, to me, is frustrating.

Beyond the characters, I also found the overall conclusion underwhelming. Looking back, I realize that despite loving so many aspects of the first three seasons, I can’t think of a single fight in season 4 that truly impressed me or a single scene that left a lasting impact. If I had to pick the most significant moment, I suppose it would be the twist with Eren’s father, but I can’t even recall my initial reaction to it, which makes me think it didn’t leave a strong impression on me. I won’t even go into the geopolitical aspects, which I found poorly executed, or the post-Rumbling events, which felt unsatisfying.

Ultimately, this ending doesn’t spark any strong emotions in me, neither hatred nor satisfaction. It feels like it missed something, though I can’t pinpoint exactly what, since I had no specific expectations. The characters I followed for so long ended up disappointing me, and it’s hard to believe that the early seasons were truly leading to this outcome. The more I reflect on season 4, the more conflicted I feel about almost every aspect of it, which is a shame because it had so much potential. If I ever rewatch Attack on Titan, I’d probably stop at season 3.

I don‘t necessarily expect anyone to understand my feelings. I know people will try to argue that « « Armin did save humanity bc (…) » or « Mikasa made the strongest choice since (…) » (I didn’t mention how much I hated that Ymir final but I think y’all heard a lot of similar opinions anyway), something along those lines. Maybe Im completely wrong in my analysis. But in the end, regardless of whether my reasoning is flawed, I just didnet enjoy this season or its finale.

In total, we've seen ***5*** transformations.

Ymir did ***2*** on screen, while an extra ***3rd*** one happened off screen (Only the light was shown, no titan) in Season 2, Episode 5, during a flashback scene not shown here.

All of Porco's transformations happened off-screen surprisingly enough. Although the one shown above was the closest to us seeing one for him, as he proceeds to breach the ground beneath Eren soon after doing so. That's ***1*** for Porco.

And as for Falco, he did ***2*** in total, with ***1*** being his normal Jaws Titan form, and ***1*** in his Bird Titan form, seen very briefly during the 2nd Special. 

An off screen transformation on the ship was mentioned by Annie, but we never see it happen at all, even in the aftermath shot, we only see the ship sinking, with Kiyomi and the other party all in life boats.

As for the transformations themselves, ***not a single*** partial one occured, with all three Shifters tranformating to their fullest form. 
Showing that none where ever put in any immediate life threatening situations to warrant one!

Falco is the only one of the group to have had ***2 seperate forms*** be shown. With his normal form, and bird form. Technically a 3rd if you count in his pure titan form, but that wasn't the Jaws so that one's doesn't count. Overall, shows how special Falco really was.

And lastly, Ymir is the only Jaws Titan shown to not have a hardened mask covering their face. There is no direct reasoning as to why, some say it's from lack of experience, being trapped in a pure titan form for 60 years, Ymir simply just being different and unique, or Isayama simply not planning out the Jaws Titan's final design and abilities at that point. Whatever the case, she's pretty cool in my book, so that's that.

#End Conclusion:

Really cool Titan in general, sad that Ymir didn't get the mask, but she's still a cute little gremlin! 
Whats also kinda funny about the Jaw is that it was used by people who sacrificed, or risked their lives in protecting Reiner throughout the series itself :D

I was so invested to the show that I finished the first 3 seasons in 5 days. The night I finished the first episode of season 4 I was kinda confused why it had a different animation style so I did some digging to find some answers and found out about the whole WIT-MAPPA thing, because of that other articles started to pop up with titles like ""Why season 4 is the worst season of aot"", ""Why aot has the worst ending in anime history"" etc. I didn't give them much attention because I enjoyed so much the first 3 seasons that I was in denial that they would mess it up in their final. After 2 days I think, I finished season 4 (my favourite season by far) and I loved the ending, so it got me thinking why they were saying bad things about the ending and with little to no research by skimming random articles I came to the conclusion that the manga had a bad ending. After 3-4 months I learned that both studios that animated aot cut a major content from the manga, so like a fellow comrade I started reading it. Before getting into chapter 139 I had in mind that the ending must be so horrible, but getting into the chapter I wouldn't say that, I get that the whole thing was kinda rushed especially the conversation between Eren and Armin in the paths, but it wasn't that bad, so again I was really confused why people were saying the ending was bad. This time though I did a full research by reading all sorts of things in all social medias and reading things from the hellhole with the name titanfolk, and the only thought I had is that there is no way people are that stupid. The reason why I'm telling you all of this is to give this reddit page a big THANK YOU for not being retards and actually understanding the story because HOLY FUCK I was starting to lose faith in the community.

I'm coming here to share quite a different take of the ending and of Eren’s character from the rest of people in the fandom, which I think is what Isayama tried to put more into consideration when creating the anime dialogue which a lot of people see just as spoonfeeding, but in a meta sense I actually find genius. Not just that but after talking it out with a few friends of mine I see how much more of a tragedy Eren’s character is after he got the powers of the founder. This take might seem really out of place for some people but I think it’s what really came to be for Eren’s character and  part of the message at the end that Isayama tried to convey with the anime ending.



First of all I want to show this one section of an interview done with Hajime Isayama by NY Times after the conclusion of the anime:

[Isayama compares his situation with Eren’s, as he got a greater power, the more restricted he became with his art, basically telling us that after Eren got the powers of the founder, he had lost any sense of agency or of “ making a decision”, and his will becomes irrelevant to what the story concludes with.](https://preview.redd.it/fvx7mxt4y76d1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe1dedf7a893eb7d9bf90796f09d40fac98b11cc)



Like the title of the post says I think Eren becomes a literal puppet to the story after he gets the powers of the founder, but first to know what I mean by this we have to take into consideration many factors:



-Since Eren sees ALL of time at once because he has the power of the founder (which connects him with the coordinate), then he sees EVERY single detail of the future and past, meaning that any type of decision he takes, he has already taken in the future, by this I mean “Eren’s will” is non existent, you need imperfect knowledge to make a decision, and since Eren becomes omnipresent, any sense of will or agency is taken away from Eren, and by this point he just lets events of the story play out while he is experiencing all of time at once.



-Because Eren sees an already existing future and every single detail of it, this means that he’s trapped into this future and cannot do anything to change it like the interview states with his powers, Eren can not even try and save his friends during the port battle with the power of the founder, he has become powerless by this point and the only thing he can do is benefit the already existing timeline, which explains him being forced to keep it stable by sending Dina to his mom so the story plays out as it is. If Eren tried anything new, nothing would happen since that means all of his journey to the point of him getting the power of the founder will not happen, it’s a paradox which Eren has been trapped in thanks to the deterministic nature of paths.



-AOT follows the concept of Eternalism, which states that the past, present, and future is already existent, which means in this occasion that Eren can’t change what’s set in stone because of the deterministic nature of AOT’s world, and so this also means that the future needs to exist the same as the past, because the future affects the past as well simultaneously.



So in conclusion what does this exactly tell us? Eren after gaining the powers doesn’t become a literal powerful person who has the ability to manipulate the timeline at his perfect will like most people think, nor is he able to actually use much of the founder powers at all, these powers have limited him by his knowledge of a already set in stone future, and so Eren’s tragedy comes to an end, the more power and knowledge Eren had, the less freedom he came to have (similar to how he realizes his concept freedom is far from possible with a cruel humanity existing outside the walls), to the point of literally now being a puppet to the story, which his founder titan resembles.

[Proof and answer to Eren also not being able to turn the titans back into humans nor being able to control them, he has become powerless and his powers literally chain him.](https://preview.redd.it/pzkrk071086d1.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7a10bff2929140139d78f38f1e2e321e1f0a787)

  
The rumbling was the last of Eren’s will and it was the ultimate execution and the incarnation of his will, which is a titan that just moves forward until the very end of the story. Historia at the end of the anime is given a dialogue that says that the story of AOT isn’t just caused by Eren but by EVERYONES choices, but since Eren is connected to the coordinate and all eldians are connected to the coordinate and we follow a story of human hatred with the focus of Eldian oppression, Eren essentially BECOMES the story, a god tied down to a future he might not like, but that is willed by everyone left in the world to stop him.

[Eren isn't the only one who matters when it comes to the making of the future, and quite literally can't change the future by that point on when he gets the powers of the founder.](https://preview.redd.it/pipu2irk086d1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee60d475a11ba8f1b501c120f0c9a5ec312479bb)

  
But if Eren is a slave to not just his own desires but now to the story that has came to be, did his goals ever even matter? Well his primal goal of freedom was still a success, because even if he’s unfree inside the story, paths grants him the ability to be OUTSIDE the story. Paths is more of a meta inspired world and by that point Eren is free to do whatever he wants inside the world of paths and experience the aftermath of his rumbling in there, he’s free when he’s outside the deterministic world of AOT, think of it as Eren suddenly becoming a real life person and he used to be a manga character, he now has access to all volumes of AOT and can see the conclusion to it (well except stuff after his death), but he can’t do anything to change that world he lives in, just let events play out, but his ultimate last will (the rumbling) will still achieve a lot of what he wanted to do, but the ultimate outcome isn't really his favorite.  


https://preview.redd.it/ueiqq5ox086d1.png?width=1036&format=png&auto=webp&s=b75e0de96f37f19f3ca4a0567c1db4a64c967ad5

  
This is why I think Eren words being killed as “you guys stop me” and not him saying he gave up for his friends, this is also why I think the final episode also had a lot of spoonfeeding (other than it also being cause of people not understanding a lot of the topics) but I don't really see it as that, because by that point it’s like Eren and Armin are going through the story of their world and analyzing it, it’s like if they were analyzing their own characters in the real world from paths. 139 becomes the most meta chapter (episode in this case) ever and it all makes even more sense, the whole part of that episode is like if Isayama was talking to the viewer about the ending through Eren and Armin.



I wonder what you guys think about this take and hope you liked reading it, I’m aware some people don’t like Eren lacking agency or lacking weight on decisions, but I think this is what Yams wanted to do with the ending, and of course I’m not saying this is the correct interpretation but it’s what makes most sense to me.

However in season 4, not only is she sidelined, only having a handful of seasons during the entire season which is inexcusable itself, but the scenes that she does have goes against her previous character and character arc. 

First off (and probably the most minor of her issues) is that her character arc being completed doesn’t justify her absence. Even characters with completed arcs can still have their own moments. Jeans character arc in seasons 1-3 was already completed but he still has his beliefs challenged by the events of the story when he had to choose between choosing the alliance or the Yeagerists (Historia had something similar with the dilemma to help Eren or follow the 50 year plan but this is executed much worse for reasons I’ll be stating later). Flochs character arc was completed in season 3 during the battle of Shiganshina where he formed his world view that it’s necessary to become a devil to protect the people, and wesee the results of that development in season 4 with his extremist behaviors and actions. Both of these characters already had their arcs completed, but they still continued to have great moments.  

It can be argued that due to AOT’s plot driven narrative there’s no opportunities for Historia to do anything where as Floch and Jean were still integral to the plot. Although this is true the plot can very easily be expanded to emphasize Historia and her character, and there’s no better opportunity for this than the Yeagerist uprising arc which despite being about the government and political climate of Paradis, but Historia is absent from this except for the creation of the pregnancy plot line despite her being a key police’s figure on Paradis. There’s certainly more room to expand upon this subject. Some would argue that it would ruin the pacing, but I’d say that these additions would be the complete opposite of that. The Marley arc and Yeagerists uprising are by far the shortest arcs of the series each being about 8 episodes. Including more flashbacks and more scenes in the present time would solve other issues with season 4 as well such as the poor world building while still giving room to expand upon Historias character without compromising the pacing. There’s no reason for Historia to be sidelined the way she was. And I’ve seen someone argue that this is a season 4 issue rather than a Historia specific one because several other characters were also put to the side, but the difference between Historia and characters such as Levi and Hange which makes this far worse for Historia in particular is that Historias previous character is ruined as well.

To understand how her character was ruined, we first have to understand Historia as a person before elaborating on how season 4 Historia goes against it. 
Historias character arc was learning to live a life for herself which she can be proud of. She became Queen for her own reasons not because the military wanted her to, and her primary motive is to help people and it always has been. At first this trait might seem exclusive to Krista, but the primary difference between Krista and Historia is that Historia does what she wants for herself regardless of everyone else whereas Krista seeks validation and approval from others. In this regard Historia is selfish since she does whatever she wants to, disregarding the desires of others, but her goal (which is to help people) is selfless. They’re both kind hearted by nature which is shown countless times during the uprising and prior even as far back as her childhood when she says that she wants to be like the similarly kind Frieda and Krista, and Frieda responds by telling her to be herself. Historias character arc accentuates this trait even further rather than reduce it since Historia’s willing to do what she believes is right regardless of the opinion of others which is best exemplified in the Reiss chapel. 

It’s easy to interpret her defiance of Rod as selfish, but once you analyze these scenes it becomes apparent that her goal was to help humanity as well and not just herself. Before her badass worst girl in the world moment she asks Rod why didn’t the previous Founders stop the Titans which shows that she had the rest of humanity in mind. If she didn’t and was thinking entirely selfishly then she’d have no reason to ask this question whatsoever since it wouldn’t affect her. And it’s only after Rod states that the First Kings will possesses the inheritors does she decide to finally fight back against Rod because she realizes that he was only looking after himself. She insults humanity out of resentment towards Rod because he used the “good of humanity”  to try to manipulate her into eating Eren. She was opposing her father and his wishes during this moment rather than humanity itself which is supported by her later actions which shows that she still had others in mind. Immediately after this she tells Eren that whenever she sees someone saying that no one needs them, she wants to rescue them, and tell them that it isn’t true which shows her benevolent nature. It’s reinforced in the next chapter (chapter 67) that she was trying to help humanity when she says the Reiss family losing the Founder was a good thing for humanity. This provides additional insight into her thoughts while inside the Reiss chapel. And finally in chapter 70 when Eren states that she became Queen to help people which is shown by her orphanage, and she then explains that she got carried away during her speech at the Reiss chapel.

Given all this, Historia would never support the rumbling OR the 50 year plan. They both go against her views and beliefs (which is why ANR Erehisu sucks as well). She even says herself that she’d never be able to forgive herself if she supported Eren, and yet she concedes to Eren anyways within moments. Historia would never be able to accept either option easily, but this moral dilemma is glossed over with little to no internal conflict. These options would be a last resort, but she never tries to find another solution, she never tries to stop Eren, if anything the exact opposite happens which is shown by her compliance with Eren in chapter 130. Historia would never be able to live with pride after supporting the Rumbling due to the weight of her actions, but she still has a ‘good’ ending with the farmer where she happily smiles with her daughter as if she didn’t directly and willingly assist in the largest atrocity in history despite her previously saying that she’d never be able to forgive herself if she did. Not only is this strange for Historias character, but it’s in extremely poor taste considering the severity of the rumbling especially considering how Eren whos far more unhinged than her is broken and inconsolable by the weight of his actions, but Historia who’s far more humane and less extreme isn’t. 

The other major issue is the relationship with the Farmer which has several issues with it. It’s depicted as a forced relationship which she only got into out of political purposes, and some would say that this is intentionally misinterpreting the relationship in a way that portrays it poorly, but this is suggested by the narrative as well. She never shows any love or affection for the man whatsoever, and if anything shows the complete opposite. She frowns and is clearly unhappy in literally every scene she shares with him with the sole exception of when she’s with her daughter which is why so many people theorized that he was a red herring to begin with (Although it can be reasonably concluded that this can be because of the rumbling). Historia has no choice, but to get with someone due to her circumstances. Both the 50 year plan and allowing Eren to commit the rumbling requires her to have a child. Historia only had a child because she had to, otherwise she would have been forced to undertake the 50 year plan, but Historia having a child out of necessity rather than because she wants to is obviously out of character.  (Why Isayama took agency from a character who’s arc was learning to have agency I’ll never know)  Prior to these scenarios Historia shows no desire to have children or a relationship. The subject is never even brought up and instead replaced with a half assed shitty mystery which was the pregnancy plot line. The only thing indicating that Historia actually wanted to be with the farmer is that she approached him herself, but this can easily be explained as her not wanting to have political bondage to another noble who might have their own agenda, and timeline wise she seems to confront the farmer after her talk with Eren. 

This can be fixed by expanding on their relationship and making the farmer an actual character which is entirely possible since Niccolo and Sasha was good despite Niccolo being a new character, and again there’s definitely more room for expanding on this during Season 4 Part 1, but even if you don’t want to give Historia considerably more screentime these issues can still easily be fixed. Just minor tweaks to how the relationship is depicted can fix these issues such as Historia already expressing a desire to be with the farmer BEFORE the 50 year plan is proposed so it seems like she got with him willingly and not due to circumstance or even something as simple as her showing affection for the man, or him consoling her about impending rumbling which would make it clear  that Historias depression is caused by the rumbling as well as showing some level of trust and closeness between the two rather than complete indifference which is how the relationship is depicted in canon.

Objectivity in fictional work really needs clarification along with an extremely LONG, vast and lengthy amount of discussion in general by the entire world.

The thing is that the majority opinion on something should not automatically be regarded as the correct opinion or the objective opinion, since the majority opinion about a lot of scientific things has been vastly wrong in the past, they should serve as real world examples. The majority opinion thousands of years ago was that the Earth is the only planet or the Sun revolves around the Earth and not the other way around.

Now onto critiquing, the problem is that there is no real fine line between criticism, perfectionism and nitpicking, it's all jumbled up and is a bit of a blur.

Which is why I always say that Isayama could've written THE MOST perfect of endings and people would still find flaws in it and there's a VERY big reason for it.

That reason is because there is no humanly way in which a human being can mathematically quantify and fulfill every single part of an art-work the art-work in question can be anything, a book, a soundtrack, a movie, a painting, anything creative really.

Now let's move onto to ""misinterpretation"".. some people who got the message that the author was conveying or depicting say that it's the audience's fault who don't understand the message being conveyed by the author and some people who didn't get the message say that it's the author's mistake for not expressing his message or themes clearly enough.

This is another big problem towards critiquing an art-work since not every single person has the same way of looking at the world.

Now to dive even more into that, we first have to see who the intended audience is for the author's work.

The intended audience in this case is the Japanese fanbase, the art-work is intended for them, they are the people who understand the cultural nuances within Isayama's work, I mean say for example If I was watching an Italian movie, I could never truly understand all the cultural nuances in it, I could read a thousand articles, watch a million movies, but I could still never figure out each and every nuance.

Not unless I experience the culture myself and not just for a few weeks, but for a few years at least and talk to people of all different ages and walks of life to truly understand the culture in its depth.

YOU and I are not the perfect people to critique it because we haven't personally experienced the culture and we don't understand the nuances depicted enough to even make a logical critique on it, I especially used the word logical here because logical is different than objective or rational, the Japanese in this regard are the perfect people who can critique the romance aspect of Isayama's story because they are the people who understand those nuances better than anyone since they have seen those nuances and even experienced them in their culture probably since childhood, and not to mention the fact that they are the intended audience for his work.

What one might say is the epitome of bad writing, the Japanese might consider it phenomenally flawless because that is in line with their cultural, societal or moral values.

The problem occurs because we are using western standards to critique an art-work which was written by a native Japanese author intended to be for the primary consumption of the Japanese fanbase.

It is not at all fair to put the on blame Isayama just because you or I don’t recognize certain cultural nuances or romantic hints in his work which the Japanese might consider it a ""classic"" and common thing in their culture and they ""picked/realized"" them up without even trying; Isayama wrote the manga for the Japanese audience who is the primary audience for his art-work and primarily consumes and understands the cultural and romantic nuances within his art-work.

One of these said cultural nuances is understanding the word ""family"" which in said context isn't referring to a hierarchy or a structure but overall a general feeling and a cultural nuance and it's an homage to the Japanese culture since people in Japan are heavily family oriented, Isayama was never shy of using words like Brother and Sister; We saw that Falco and Gabi paraded around the Braus residence referring to themselves as a brother and sister, yet for a huge reason, Mikasa and Eren never referred to each other as such, they referred to each other ALWAYS as family as evidenced in the Manga, also, Isayama had Eren say this very line to Mikasa ""I'm not your little kid or your brother."" And in the case of Gabi and Falco despite them using those words ""Brother"" and ""Sister"" no one questioned the true nature of their intended relationship, which was romantic, because in their case Isayama made it obvious.

There’s a reason why every character in the Attack on Titan Universe AND the Japanese audience refers to Mikasa and Eren as childhood friends and never as a ""Brother"" or a ""Sister"". So a part of the audience is automatically setting themselves up for disappointment and failure when they AUTOMATICALLY associate the word ""family"" with the dictionary definition of the word.

And just because someone doesn't or didn’t associate certain actions, words and deeds with romance it doesn’t AT all mean the intention and implication wasn’t there, there’s a thing called subtle story-telling, and in complete honestly to be very, very fair, Isayama is NOT at all obligated to spoon feed his entire geographical WORLDWIDE fanbase with explicit romance or I love you moments, the manga was meant to be primarily for the consumption by the Japanese fanbase and not the western fanbase, also there is absolutely NO WAY that he was ever going to give every couple the Falco and Gabi ""I am in love with you"" moment, since every character obviously has a different personality, which is why the Japanese audience were forced to look deeper into things, which is characterization and cultural nuances and this is the reason why the entire Japanese fanbase considers the chapter 50 moment ""I'll wrap that around you forever and ever, as much as you want"" to be a reciprocation of feelings from Eren's side.

The Japanese fanbase in its entirety considers that one moment to be an I love you back from Eren, which is why their entire fanbase is EM, it's a cultural nuance depiction of romance, but it can be completely understood how that kind of thing can get lost culturally.

If the intended audience of the art-work didn't see it in the terms as intended by the author, that would be an indication that the author has done a terrible job, but the intended audience which is the Japanese in this case views EM as romantic and sees it in the way that it was intended by the author, so he has not failed.

And the Japanese audience views Mikasa's scarf as the literal ""RED"" string of fate which ties two people together similar to western soulmates but even in a more purer and sacred sense and people in Japan are very heavily family-oriented and that is also helped by the fact that Mikasa's scarf is red.

That's the reason why the Japanese fanbase understands the romance aspect of their dynamic much better than we do.

Isayama always penned his manga with realism in regards to human emotions, we saw how the most badass and hardened of warriors cried and begged for their lives in their final moments when getting eaten by Titans and making a plea to them to let them go.

Should we have gotten more hints about Eren’s feelings? Of course!

But that's not the intended way that Isayama wanted to and intended to write it, you cannot judge his art-work by Western standards of romance which will obviously differ than the Asian/Japanese standards.

For the Japanese audience that moment from chapter 50 with the ""I'll wrap that around you forever and ever, as much as you want"" is pretty damn romantic for a shounen manga.

The anime made the romantic implications really, really plainly obvious, the anime episode of Manga chapter 50, in anime in that scene, there was slowed down time, dramatic coloring, music, beautiful bellflowers which represent eternal love and constancy coupled with Eren's promise of wrapping the scarf forever and ever and if you consider every single one of those facts in unison with what Eren said ""I'm not your kid or your little brother"" and the fact that they both refer to each other as family and never as brother or sister; the fact that he views her romantically or at least not platonically at all is a very fair conclusion to draw, I mean otherwise what's the reason to go so far out of the way to make things seem romantic if that was not at all an implication or an intention?

I mean, even then you can say it was not meant to be romantic but denying that it was at least a doorway into romance is one just being in complete denial and just being dishonest.

Some people say that if the relationship between the two of them was romantic, why wasn't it ever fully explored?

I mean, from a completely storytelling POV I can completely understand this, this can be argued simply by the fact that they both found out each other feelings in chapter 50 and knew how they felt about each other, so from a realist POV, it makes sense that they just never brought it up again because they were fighting a literal suicidal war with cannibalistic monsters that eat people and had other important things to do.

But then again, the western fanbase is not familiar with the cultural and romantic nuances which the Japanese might be so they cannot fairly critique it properly.

Before the timeskip, romance was barely a part of the series but after the timeskip, we were getting romance from every which way.

Sasha and Niccolo, Falco and Gabi, Marlowe and Hitch, Annie and Armin, Annie and Berthold, Grisha and Dina, Grisha and Carla, Mikasa and Eren.

So it's not fair to say that romance was never a part of the series, it was there, just not at the forefront.

That's really where the problem stems from, the fact that we in the Western fanbase have a different criteria of critique, reading and interpreting, understanding and comprehending things than the Japanese fanbase and that's solely because we're not fully aware of their culture and the cultural nuances which Isayama put in his artwork.

And another fact is that we actually lack a centralized critiquing framework, we cannot objectively critique anything.

And the fun fact is that art is not meant to be viewed objectively in any way.

Take the example of a painting for example.

A painting is drawn on a canvas or can be digital.

Some people may like the painting because of the visual shapes represented in it, some people may like it because they appreciate the color tones in it, some people may like it because of the emotion it oozes and some people may like it because brings them warmth or comfort in some way and some people may like it because it reminds them of something else entirely.

What this basically means is that people can like a singular object or a thing for entirely different reasons, and because they like it for different reasons just strengthens the fact that they have a different criteria of critiquing it and that everything is ultimately, subjective.

Take my personal example, I absolutely hate Inception, Shutter Island, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, The Wolf Of Wall Street and The Departed.

All 6 movies are loved by a vast number of people.

Do I dare say that those movies are bad? To me, yes, but other people view them as amazing, that just means that we viewed them in different ""light"" and have a different perception of them and thus, critiqued them differently, my opinion doesn't make it a fact.

For example if someone says that Alfred Hitchcock objectively makes bad films or Studio Ghibli's animation is objectively crap rather than questioning them why they think that it's bad or laying out facts or making an educated argument that it isn't; the real thing that we should question them on is, what their basis for judging and the standards and criteria that they set for the judging and critiquing are.

This is the reason professional critics exist, because they at least have a centralized framework which they use to critique an artwork, but that in itself is another problem.

The fact is that using a singular framework for critiquing each and every art-work which can vastly differ from each other is also stupidity in itself.

Talking about normal people and not professional critics, one cannot objectively make a critique on anything, the only way a human can possibly do that is if you had some sort of a switch where you could completely turn your emotions off and make a completely cold, hard and logical assessment for said art-work.

There can be good and bad qualities to art but it's not really appropriate to classify or define it as such. The absence of any impartiality or bias is also senseless since bias and subjectivity is the entire basis of judgement and critique in the first place, another thing to consider is art-work and the criteria for judging art-work is also constantly and consistently changing.

When the very perception of the critiquing principle itself is flexible, volatile and versatile and is not at all fixed to this extent, it is just realistically impossible to talk in terms of impartiality.

What this really means is that even the professional critics critique something based on a certain set of principles and standards which are currently outlined and defined.

But even those currently defined standards change every few years.

Take this for example, the Hollywood standards for ""Objective"" judging or critiquing today must be EXTREMELY and vastly different from what they were in the '60s.

So what does this mean? Does this mean that the ""Objectively"" best regarded movie from the '60's sucks when it's measured to today's standards?

If you compare them with a book or a dictionary definition, then yes, they must absolutely suck, but do they actually? Absolutely not; Since art-work is not meant to be viewed in objective or binary terms in any way, it's meant to be subjective since the ENTIRE intention of an art-work is meant to get a reaction out of people and also to get people emotionally invested in it.

I mean say for example if a movie about Korean Culture was made in the 1800's and a similar movie was made in 2021 about what the Korean culture was like back in 1800's.

Would we use the same professional objective criteria for judging both those artworks?

Would we use the professional objective standards used in the 1800's to judge and critique the 2021 movie or would we use modern standards to judge it?

I can literally state that the 139 ending is objectively good.

Does that turn it into a ""fact?"" Fuck no.

Most importantly, the very idea of 'objective criticism' means being able to represent facts and laying out an argument without any kind of bias or impartiality, but the thing is that the very BASE or premise of art is an expression of the brain's imagination and creativity which is well the very foundation of subjectivity, the very idea of objective criticism or reality or facts or ""truths"" lose meaning when all that anyone is really doing is passing a criticism or a judgement on something which is born out of subjectivity.

What this really means is that there is absolutely NO objectivity in art since it is just realistically not possible to quantify each and every aspect or interpretation of an art-work into numerically measureable terms.

However, all this said, some aspects and qualities of an artwork which would be very few, can be judged but the aspect in question must be definable and have crystal clear boundaries.

For example, you cannot have an objective discussion on human behaviour because people evolve every second, every minute, every day, people can have extremely conflicting emotions, you can never really be sure what someone is thinking, but you could maybe have an objective discussion on a story though, the plot and solely that.

The argument in favor of or against still has to be objective so how would that be achieved? With some form of a framework or test to indicate that the ultimate outcome is not simply biased or preferential.

But creating such a framework or deciding upon the criteria is the ultimate challenge and would likely be very difficult and highly improbable to come up with.

People can say that art-work XYZ is objectively bad, I mean yeah, sure, it is objectively bad, but only SUBJECTIVELY objectively, not OBJECTIVELY objectively.

But even if art-work XYZ is held upto professional industry-grade objective standards, what's to say that those standards and the criteria for critique isn't in some way structurally or fatally flawed?

Since the objective judging standards were also created by people whose opinions are highly subjective?

You can ultimately TRY, the keyword being here TRY to measure something in objective terms using a set criteria or framework but your set criteria for objective measuring will obviously always differ from other people so basically measuring something in objective terms is impossible because to measure it in objective terms first, both parties would have to come up with an objective measuring criteria and you could never do that because the criteria for objective measuring would also be subjective.

To sum it, art is not at all meant to be viewed or consumed in any objective terms, it's meant to be subjective since it's born out of subjectivity, if any kind of art was born out of objectivity, we would've run out of good material to consume years and years ago. This includes music, books, manga, comics, paintings; basically all forms of art.

Basically TLDR: Art is not meant to be objective, it's highly subjective, you don't like the ending? Cool, no one is forced to share your opinion; you liked the ending? Cool, no one is forced to share your opinion, I personally don't like the ending, but with each passing day with re-reads, I understand it more, I understand the gist of what Isayama was going for, but seriously for f\*ck's sake stop bashing Isayama because you didn't get or understand certain things, he penned the manga for the Japanese not the Westerners, he is not obligated to spoon-feed or openly explain the cultural nuances to his entire fanbase since his work was primarily meant for consumption by the Japanese, he's not obligated to make things easier FOR YOU by explaining or clarifying Japanese cultural nuances in his work just so reading, understanding, interpreting and comprehending them becomes easy for the Westerners, the Westerners are not his intended audience, the Japanese are; and also let people enjoy what they want to and don't shit on them just because they have a different interpretation on something which differs than yours, LIVE and let LIVE.

They are primarily based on the anime due to the music, animation, voice acting, etc. Feel free to leave yours in the comments!

Honourable Mention: Alliance vs. Eren and Ymir at Fort Salta AKA The Battle of Heaven and Earth (chapters 135-138/Final Chapters Specials 1 and 2)

I know that this battle is often criticized for excessive plot armour, but I can't deny that this battle is cool as fuck, which makes sense considering that it's the final battle in the series. After all the heartbreak and difficulties the Alliance have gone through, they can finally work as a team and kick the asses of a bunch of titans instead of having to deal with the guilt of killing other people. The synergy and teamwork between the Alliance members (Annie flinging Mikasa, Reiner and Pieck protecting Jean, etc.) is amazing to see, as they are once again comrades just as they were at the beginning of the series. The different designs for the previous Nine Titans are also really cool, and there are some great standout moments, like Falco's flying titan's appearance and the previous shifters helping the Alliance. The climax of the battle (and the series), when Armin and Eren have a colossal fistfight while Reiner, Annie and Pieck give their all fighting the giant worm, are absolutely insane and harrowing, especially in the anime adaptation. The major drawback of this battle for me is that it is by far one of the least tactical battles in the series, especially compared to some of the others on this list. They just split up and kill titans in really cool ways. It's still an amazing final battle for the series, though.

&#x200B;

5. Squad Levi vs. Squad Kenny in Rod's cavern (chapter 64/episode 44)

This is a short and quick battle, but it really stood out to me when I first watched season 3 part 1 (having not read the Uprising Arc in the manga). Seeing the Survey Corps use their ODM to fight humans was a crazy thing to see in full (as previously, we had only really seen Levi do that). There were also great tactics in the battle, such as having Armin (the worst combatant) use smoke shells to obscure visibility and having Sasha use her arrows to pick off enemies from afar. I also like how they explained the weaknesses of the anti-personnel gear in a way that made it believable that people with swords could kill people with guns. I also love the anime addition of having Levi and Kenny fight. Like I said, this fight was very brief, but I found it very cool and impactful.

&#x200B;

4. Survey Corps and Yeagerists vs. Marleyan army in Shiganshina (chapters 116-119/episodes 75-78)

When I read this battle in the manga when it came out, my mind was absolutely blown. I loved how fucked this battle was from the perspective of Armin and co. On the one hand, they know that Zeke is planning to euthanize all Eldians and suspect that Eren is against him, but they have no real clue what Eren's plan is, so they're not sure if they can support him. At the same time, they obviously need to fight off the Marleyans, who at this point we've come to somewhat empathize with (especially Reiner). They are also hesitant to help Floch and the Yeagerists, who just imprisoned them and killed Paradis' premier. It's just a completely absurd and fucked situation, yet they still stick to their guns and fight to defend Eren. From a titan point of view, Eren vs. Reiner, Galliard and Pieck is easily one of the peak titan fights in my opinion, as we can see just how powerful and determined Eren is as he barely fights off three other titans. Gabi and Falco's subplot here is also great, and the Zeke spinal fluid plot finally pays off in this battle too. Unfortunately, the battle is fairly light on tactics, except for Pieck faking her death to shoot Zeke, but it's still an absolute treat to watch. And it culminates in arguably the craziest cliffhanger (Eren's head getting shot off) in the series.

&#x200B;

3. Survey Corps vs. Marleyan army in Liberio (chapters 100-105/episodes 64-67)

The assault on Liberio is amazing to me because it was the first time that our Survey Corps protagonists were made to be mirror images of the Warriors. Here they are, attacking enemies in their homes and killing civilians (some of them intentionally, like Floch). The Marley Arc had already been an inversion of the prior arcs, and this fight brought that full circle. Eren's opening salvo, his fight with the War Hammer Titan, the return of the Survey Corps, Armin nuking the port, Eren using Galliard to eat Lara, and Gabi killing Sasha all made for an absolutely insane battle to set the tone for post-timeskip AOT, and culminated in the reveal that Zeke had been working with the Survey Corps (something I was in denial about before this point). Again, this battle wasn't too tactic-heavy, but for me this battle shone by making (some of) us feel bad for the Marleyan characters, like Pieck getting blown to pieces by thunder spears and Gabi watching her friends and comrades be stomped and shot to death. It gave us a real, terrifying look at the horrors of war and made it so that we saw firsthand why the cycle of violence makes monsters of us all.

&#x200B;

2. Survey Corps vs. Warriors in Shiganshina (chapters 74-82/episodes 50-54)

Some of you may be surprised that the battle central to the Return to Shiganshina Arc isn't in first, but don't get me wrong, this battle still absolutely fucking slaps. There are essentially three concurrent battles – Eren and Armin vs. Bertholdt; Mikasa, Jean, Conny and Sasha vs. Reiner; and Levi, Erwin and the Survey Corps vs. Zeke. Each of the three battles is engaging, harrowing and tactic-heavy. I think Mikasa and co. vs. Reiner is the weakest of the three, but it's still a great watch, especially with Hange's surprise return being the final straw in defeating Reiner. Armin's sacrifice against Bertholdt is also great, especially because it not only provides more development for Armin in that he sacrifices his life bravely, but also because he uses prior knowledge about the Colossal Titan's mechanics to defeat Bertholdt. Finally, I don't think I need to explain why Erwin's speech and suicide charge are amazing; I think everyone, on any AOT subreddit, can agree that those scenes are amazing. Overall, this battle is absolutely great, but there's one that I prefer a bit more…

&#x200B;

1. Alliance vs. Yeagerists at the port (chapters 128-129/episodes 85-86)

The battle between the Alliance and the Yeagerists is my favourite battle in Attack on Titan. Yes, it's not tactic-heavy, and you can complain all day long about pLoT aRmOuR, but this is my favourite battle for several reasons. Firstly, it is the natural conclusion to all the tensions between our Survey Corps members and the Yeagerists. Floch and his followers have been antagonistic to them since the timeskip, and had only been getting worse as they captured our main characters, assassinated the premier, and nearly executed a dying Levi. Then, once the Rumbling started and the Yeagerists began rejoicing and executing Anti-Marley Volunteers, it was clear that they were going to be a problem. Having Floch and the Yeagerists be the minibosses before Eren made sense from the story's perspective. However, while the story unequivocally portrays Floch and the Yeagerists as antagonists, they are still portrayed with sympathy. Isayama even brought back early characters like Samuel and Daz just to have our main characters fight familiar faces. It's clear that they aren't fascists or nationalists like Floch; instead, they are just regular people are taking the easy path; people who are okay with the rest of the world dying so they don't have to fight them. It's an understandable perspective, which makes it all the sadder when they come to blows and Conny has to kill them. Another reason why I love this fight is because it's almost a total inversion of the series before; now our protagonists are working with the Armoured and Female Titans to fight against the ""Survey Corps"". I find it so amazing that Isayama was able to invert the series so well. Speaking of inversions, the best part about this fight for me is that it makes Mikasa, Armin, Jean and Conny even more like the Warriors. They already attacked enemy civilians like them, but this fight compounds this by having them become ""traitors"" and killing their comrades. I was legitimately speechless when Samuel said the same thing to Conny that he had said to Bertholdt about reclaiming land and sharing meat. There are also cool action scenes, like Falco's Jaw Titan reveal and Floch charging towards the boat. The battle also ends with a great sendoff for Magath and Keith. To me, this fight is peak Attack on Titan.",False,False,AttackOnRetards,My Favourite Battles in Attack on Titan,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/17yplwr/my_favourite_battles_in_attack_on_titan/

Hello everyone! this is actually my first post on here, so wish me luck!

Anyway, on to the main topic. If you go online, whether it be quora, reddit, twitter, or youtube, you will see that the Rumbling arc has a lot of supporters and a lot of vocal critics of it online. Such online noise will give the impression of a rather controversial and not very liked arc, and that seems to be the consensus if you just look at comments and reddit posts.

It is commonly agreed that the rumbling arc needed to live up to the massive hype of the peak fiction war for paradis and marley arc, and the controversy seems to come from here. Some people say it was just as good as those great arcs, while others compare it to game of thrones season 8. Many people on reddit also said that they are only hyped for the first 5 episodes and the rest will be controversial and deeply divided and not too well received. Also, for this analysis, **I WILL NOT BE FOCUSING ON CHAPTER 139, BUT ONLY 124 - 138.**

However, I contend that a lot of the hate for this arc is actually statistically overblown and a product of a **loud minority**.

Now, before we start, I want to say that if you dislike this arc, that is totally fine and respectable. Overall reception does not make your opinion any less valid or invalid, and I'm glad that you have this opinion as long as you don't be toxic or insult the people involved.

Ok, so first, we need to define what a ""loud minority"" is. A loud, or vocal minority, is often a very lloud but small group of people that contrast with a much smaller majority. To give a better idea, let's give some practical examples on what is and what is not a loud minority:

Many people often point to The Last Jedi, for example, as a film that receives a lot of hate by a loud minority, pointing out the 90% RT or 85% metacritic and the 1.3 Billion dollar gross and then comparing that with the plethora of YT videos dissing it.

However, The Last Jedi product is **not** a good example of a loud minority. The film is actually statistically very divided among audiences. It has a 6.9 on IMDb with over 600K votes, a 3.2 on Letterboxd with hundreds of thousands of votes cast, and a 43% RT audience score. All of this shows that the film really does have a mixed to negative reception among audiences, and since the youtube videos are just a part of the general audience, they are not really contrasting with the quieter majority.

Now, let's give an example of a loud minority at work. This actually has to do with Attack on Titan itself, funnily enough, which is episode 65 The Warhammer Titan. The CGI of titans has often been a contentious issue in The Final Season, and this controversy has been at its max on The Warhammer Titan episode, not only because of the amount of CGI used but also because it was relatively lacking compared to the CGI use in episode 60. This has caused many people to call the episode one of the weakest of the season so far, and calling the CGI animation ""horrible"" and akin to a ""PS2"". Others, (and this is a REALLY REALLY small minority) started insulting MAPPA and the employees. Although the story of the episode was loved, if you go online, you would see tons of hate of the CGI and would probably think that the episode was a mixed bag. However, this kind of idea is absolutely not true.

On MAL, the episode has an excellent rating of 4.5/5, on [r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/) it is one of the highest rated episodes of both season 3 and season 4 with a 4.73, and on IMDb it has an overwhelming score of 9.9 with over 40K votes.

By literally all metrics available, the episode is universally acclaimed no matter where you go, with many even calling it one of the best of the series. And if you say that was because of the story carrying, that isn't really true either.

If you look at this MAL poll, [https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1889786&pollresults=1](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1889786&pollresults=1), you will see that 60% had a good to great opinion of the CGI used in this episode, while only 17% had a negative opinion. And this is in episode 65, which is considered the worst usage of CGI in the season.

The reason I am bringing this up is because it is a fantastic example of a loud minority. The actual majority and results show that the episode is excellent, but there seems to be an extremely vocal group of people that contrasts pretty heavily with this opinion on online forums and youtube videos that changes the perceived reception of the episode, and the fact that this opinion is circulated around so much is what makes it ""loud"".

On the other hand, the Last Jedi hate is not a loud minority because it seems like a lot of people really did hate that movie.

I belive that, although not to the same extent, the reception of chapters 124 - 138 is similar to the reception of the warhammer titan episode.

To prove this point, I am going to show the aggregate scores of all of the chapters on three separate websites:

1. MyAnimeList Chapter poll
2. The Tumblr monthly polls
3. The twitter polls released by Attack on Titan Wiki that ask what people thought of the chapter.

Also, something I want to point out is the difference in number of votes. MAL only has a couple hundred votes most of the time, while tumblr and twitter polls are in the thousands. However, for the sake of fairness, I will be weighting them all equally due to the differences in people on all three. MAL is often concentrated with more titanfolk and yeagerists, the tumblr polls are inherently the most trustworthy because they get people from all sides, and the twitter polls are more concentrated with alliance supporters. So, to not discriminate against any of these groups, I will weight them equally to give the fairest depiction on the overall reception of the chapter.

Now, onto the reception, I will rank them:

1. 131 - **MAL 4.79, Tumblr 4.68,** Twitter 4.64 -> **Overall 4.70**
2. 134 - MAL 4.76, Tumblr 4.52, Twitter 4.66 -> Overall 4.65
3. 130 - MAL 4.74, Tumblr 4.50, **Twitter 4.69** \->Overall 4.64
4. 135 - MAL 4.31, Tumblr 4.61, Twitter 4.65 -> Overall 4.52
5. 124 - MAL 4.69, Tumblr 4.31, Twitter 4.54 -> Overall 4.51
6. 125 - MAL 4.63, Tumblr 4.36, Twitter 4.44 -> Overall 4.48
7. 132 - MAL 4.56, Tumblr 4.36, Twitter 4.47 -> Overall 4.47
8. 127 - MAL 4.47, Tumblr 4.36, Twitter 4.48 -> Overall 4.43
9. 133 - MAL 4.53, Tumblr 4.14, Twitter 4.47 -> Overall 4.38
10. 136 - MAL 4.40, Tumblr 4.31, Twitter 4.42 -> Overall 4.38
11. 138 - MAL 3.88, Tumblr 4.48, Twitter 4.65 -> Overall 4.34
12. 129 - MAL 4.34, Tumblr 4.21, Twitter 4.44 -> Overall 4.33
13. 128 - MAL 4.36, Tumblr 4.0, Twitter 4.26 -> Overall 4.21
14. 137 - MAL 3.57, Tumblr 4.09, Twitter 4.33 -> Overall 4.0
15. 126 - MAL 3.93, Tumblr 3.52, Twitter 4.23 -> Overall 3.89
16. 139 - MAL 2.82, Tumblr 2.93, Twitter 4.21 -> Overall 3.32

Now, let's put these chapters in a tierlist to better get an idea of what I'm talking about. The qualifications I put are obviously subjective, but I believe they are pretty fair.

**Universal Acclaim - 4.5+**

131 (**4.70**), 134 (**4.65)**, 130 (**4.64**), 135(**4.52**) 124 (**4.51**)

**Positive Reviews - 4.0+**

125 ( **4.48**), 132 (**4.47**), 127 ( **4.43**), 133 (**4.38**), 136 (**4.38**), 138 (**4.34**), 129 (**4.33**), 128 (**4.21**), 137 (**4.0**)

**Mixed To Positive Reviews - 3.5+**

126 (**3.89**)

**Mixed Reviews - 3.0+**

139 (**3.36**)

**Negative Reviews - 2.5 +**

None

As we can see here, out of the 16 chapters, 5 out of them are unanimously liked by the community, and 125, 132 and 127 have near unanimous acclaim as well. That's literally half of the arc that has an extremely positive reception. Then, we move on from there, and wee see that 133, 136, 138, and 129 have great reviews, all of which are in the 4.3 - 4.4 star range as well. Even 128 has a respectable 4.21 score, and the extremely contentious 137 still has positive reviews.

Now, moving on to 126, the reception is not as good with around 3.9 stars, making it a little more mixed especially on tumblr. However, the chapter overall still has a positive skew which is why it's in this category.

So, what can we take away from this?

That from chapters 124 - 138, **100% of them are positively received to differing extents.**

It is only chapter 139 whose reception is truly mixed among the community.

There are four key implications to take away from this:

1. **The existence of the loud minority for most of this arc**. The truth is that chapters 124 - 138 have been very well received by the public, and that the vast majority liked even the controversial chapters like 128. However, entire communities like titanfolk, yeagerbomb, and much of MAL, seem to be divided in the community and have many people who dislike it. **The contrast between the perceived controversy and hate of this arc between the actual results is what creates a loud minority, and it absolutely exists here, ultimately making the amount of hate and controversy overexaggurated.**
2. **The Alliance episodes will also have a positive reception in the anime.** For literally every single episode for season 4 part 1, with the exception of episode 65 The Warhammer Titan, the overall reception of the episodes compared to the chapters adapted has improved ESPECIALLY among the dialogue episodes. Even the top tier episodes dialogue like Declaration of War have been better received in the anime compared to the manga. MAPPA seems to be doing a very good job in adapting dialogue episodes ( which most of the alliance arc is) and helping the conversations flow better, and that is generally reflected in the data. Also, since the rumors are stressing out the slower pacing and due to the improved production, the anime reception will likely be even more positive than it is in the manga. However, I am not sure about the movie and the final battle because although the chapters leading up to 139 (132 - 138) will be positively received; the actual ending is divided and might overshadow their enjoyment of the rest of the movie.
3. **No, the Rumbling Arc (124 - 138) is not Game of Thrones Season 8**. Whether or not you agree on whether or not you think it is that bad is irrelevant here. People refer to S8 so much because it is a good example of such a perceived downfall in quality and a very poorly received season. However, whether or not you think the rumbling arc was a trainwreck, the reception makes this comparison objectively untrue. Like I said before, in order to be the ""next Game of Thrones Season 8"", the reception will have to be like it as well because that is the main reason people point to it, regardless of your personal opinion. GOT S8 has gotten a rotten score on RT both critics and audience, none of the episodes are above 8/10 (4 stars) on IMDB, and every where else shows poor reviews as well. Compare that to the rumbling arc, where 87.5% of the chapters have gotten above 4 stars and many of them receiving above or close to 4.5, and the comparison simply falls flat. Even the lowest rated chapter of the entire manga (chapter 139) is significantly higher rated than episodes like the Bells and The Iron Throne
4. **Chapter 139's reception is NOT a loud minority**. Although I proved why the rest of the Rumbling Arc is suffering from a loud minority problem, 139 actually is not. The actual reception of 139 is truly very mixed, and on tumblr and MAL it is even leaning negative. So, the many people who dislike the ending do not contrast with any sort of loud minority because in reality there really are a lot of people who were dissapointed.

Lastly, **I want to stress that you are free to have your opinion and I respect it (unless it's derogatory or offensive which the SNK community has a lot of). I am only talking about the OVERALL RECEPTION here.**

So we all know that the season 1 finale was quite different from the manga, with Eren getting crushed under the rubble and going turbo mode on Annie, my question is, which do you think didn't better? For me personally, although the anime version is incredibly hyped and well animated, and serves wonderfully as a season finale, I prefer the manga version quite a bit, that ""yeah, it is"" line before Eren transforms is so fucking good, and the way he and the scouts work together is a great way to show Eren's growth, I also love that Mikasa played a larger role in all of it, I especially adore her taking responsibility for her fuck up in the forest and her reaction to the wall titan, Isayama is an absolute master when it comes to drawing facial expressions, and I don't think the anime has ever perfectly translated that to its medium unfortunately.

All in all, the reread has been going great, I'm liking Mikasa a lot more than I ever did, and by the end she might even make to my top 5, the world also feels richer in the manga, I didn't realize how much dialogue was cut in the anime, mostly because it was small chunks at a time, this is especially made clear in some world building aspects and pastor Nick's monologue revealing more information about himself and the church in his proclamation to Hange.

But the anime showed us some detail that I think really helps making more sense of it: How fucking fast colossal titans can swim.

[Here we see Yelena pointing where Eren\(not all his colossal titans, but himself and the ones that are with him\) is attacking first.](https://preview.redd.it/e9nug5e71ju81.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=a030dd182da0e51bb9f73834ade4d863fd63294c)

So, just by those two pics, we see that the Naval Port of Karifa is not on the way of Fort Salta coming from Paradis. Since we see on episode 87/chapter 130 that Eren comes out of the water, we have to assume he actually went to the northwest of Paradis instead of just going the short way to the Marley lands which would be West (and Fort Salva is to the Southwest). After destroying the Naval Port, he walks all the way North of Marley to all the way South of Marley. Which is a lot.

&#x200B;

[Kyiomi showing they are going to Odiha going South \(where the port is located\). Also we see a lot of steam in the ocean in those episodes at the port which shows Colossal Titans that were not with Eren, since he went North\).](https://preview.redd.it/xo1z0jv92ju81.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d4494ece7a28eeb0a4fac1f1addfe133613704)

[This is a scheme that I just made trying to illustrate what I am claiming here: Since Eren went North by water\(dark blue line\) he swimmed basically half the way of some the titans that swimmed south to countries that are in the south direction of Paradis\(navy blue lines\). ](https://preview.redd.it/wibn6qyk3ju81.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=6894925e20b335734291187ba6ac15bb0e5b0f83)

After Eren arrived he had to walk from top to bottom of Marley, which you can see it is a lot of ground. What I think the anime put in perspective is that the colossal titans can swim MUCH faster than how they walk. So when Eren set foot on Marley, many of the titans going to other countries are already halfway there, and their speed is much faster than Eren and his titans on ground. So it gives plenty of time for them to also reach the other lands.

I also assumed (purple line) that the titans that crush Odiha came from Eren landing spot or somewhere close, which gives more sense to why the Alliance gets there first (I think this makes sense since we see they coming from the mountains in chapter 132).

Another thing that I am assuming here is that the events of ep 87 (Eren setting foot at Marley) do not occur at the same time the alliance is on the boat, but much earlier). I think this is a fair assumption since we see Hange saying herself that they probably already are in Marley before the Port Battle and during and after it they mention a good portion of Marley must be destroyed by now.

Another thing that we have to take into account is that this is the biggest piece of map that the story gives us, so we can also assume that the entire world land is not much bigger than that, besides that population being concentrated in certain spots. Of course not everything is precise but I remember thinking back that it is weird how the Rumbling could destroy so much but now looking at this I do think it makes more sense.

I would like to read your thoughts!

And I was very disappointed that so many fans devalue the entire manga and Isayama's ten-year work, literally considering manga and anime shit because of the ending and the fact that they did not like it or they considered it bad. I'm already tired of running into messages and comments claiming that the manga is ""0/10"", ""mid"", ""terrible"" and so on because of the ending.

I understand that the finale had its flaws and it may seem bad to someone, but it pains me to see that for many such a beautiful work becomes ""mid"" or even terrible. Moreover, for me, the ending of the manga, although it confused me at first and I didn't even like it too much, is one of the most interesting and profound finales of the works that I have read.

The more you think about it, the more interesting questions open up about the nature of freedom and free will, about Eren and his fate and desires, and much more. And at the same time, more and more of what seemed contradictory, strange or bad in the final chapters is gaining meaning and depth.

It even seems to me that Isayama made the finale too ""complicated"" in terms of understanding, trying to convey very complex ideas and raising the same complex questions. And it's just sad that all this turns out to be obscured and forgotten by most readers, because ""Eren did everything for Mikasa, he's a simp!"" or something like that, although there is information on the manga pages themselves that contradicts most such statements. The complexity of the story and its ""overload"" does not allow us to get into the essence and understand what the author was trying to convey or say.

As for example, as far as I noticed, after watching a couple of reactions to the last released episode, almost no one understands that Eren literally admits at the beginning of the episode to Ramzi that he destroys the world primarily not for the sake of the island, the Eldians or even friends, but because of his selfish and insane desire to erase the world that is not corresponds to his childhood dreams of freedom. This key detail turns out to be missed, which is why Eren's motivation in the audience's head is distorted and the true motives and actions of Eren become unclear, from which questions arise, such as ""why did he let his friends kill him"", ""why did he start Rambling if he wasn't going to finish it"", ""He did everything for Mikasa?"" etc.

And in the last chapters, there are actually not one or two such key points that need to be realized in order to understand the motivations of the characters and their behavior. In general, the ending of the manga seems to have turned out to be too complicated and requiring a lot of attention and thoughtful reading from most readers. And it is very difficult to do this when we already have some thoughts and ideas about the characters in our head, which Isayama, as usual, turns over with new information. And unfortunately, because of the already established ideas, this new information that changes everything remains unnoticed, which is why the finale is full of ""plot holes"" and ""character assassinations"".

I don't know why I wrote this post, I just wanted to share my sadness about the fact that such a masterpiece remains underestimated and is considered a manga with a ""terrible ending"", when it seems to me that the final arc is the most complex and interesting, both in terms of characters, plot and themes.

Opening - It would be similar to the My Last War in tone and atmosphere, but it wouldn't be about explosions lol. This opening would show us lots of places and deserted cities around the world. It would start with the giant tree where Hallu-chan was hiding. Shiganshina. The Port. Liberio. Hizuru, Black London and the cliff of chapter 134. The Fort where the Battle of Heaven and Earth took place. And finally the giant tree made of light in PATHS. This opening would be updated any time a new big event happened, for example, by the time the walls broke down and he rumbling started, we would see Shiganshina without walls. And once we saw the episode in which the rumbling reached Liberio or all the other cities, we would see those cities destroyed and what is left of them.

&#x200B;

Ending - This would be a very sad ending. The way i envisioned it, it would be a montage of all of Eren's life and by that i mean Eren's face looking back at us (the audience). The montage would be like this: Baby Eren, Kid Eren (with tears), 15 year old Eren (rage), Eren after knowing about the future memories (depressed), Hobo Eren (calm), Manbun Eren, Paths Eren (determined) and then the final one would be the decapitated Eren head inside of the Founding Titan with his eyes closed, so pretty much what we saw in the ending of chapter 131.

First of all, we need to understand Eren's future knowledge. Rumbling is all Eren knows about the future before activating the Founder. He knows the rumbling will happen. Because he already wants it. According to Eren's plan, he would contact zeke and use the power of the Founder. He doesn't consider the possibility of being stopped because he can use the Founder. He thinks that he can only be stopped at his own will, and because he does not want it, he assumes that he will destroy the whole  outside world.  Eren doesn't know about things like ymir and paths yet.

 After the  activates the founding titan, the titan powers will be erased by the choice of mikasa. 80% of humanity will die. His friends will stop him and he will die.  If we look at Eren's conversation with Armin, that's all Eren knows. 

 For some reason, some say that Eren learned that when he kissed Historia's hand,  Titan powers would be wiped out. If we look at Eren's conversations before activating the power of the founding titan, there is not a single scene to confirm this. On the contrary, everything shows that he does not know this.

 1- Grisha does not know such a thing. So Eren couldn't have learned that either. If grisha knows about it,  It's ridiculous that he didn't tell Zeke about it .  The scene Grisha tells Zeke he saw is rumbling. He knows that those who are not of royal blood cannot use it. But since eren shows him the rumbling, grisha knows eren can use it. That's why he gave the founder to eren. But he doesn't know how far Eren will go. He hopes Zeke can stop eren after what he saw. This is a sacrifice grisha made for paradis. Because if he does not give the founder to eren, the island of paradis will destroy. 

  2- Eren's monologue in chapter 131. So eren is talking to himself. Even this speech can be proof of that. Eren also says that if we follow Zeke's plan, the titan problem will be solved. Also, deceiving himself is different, acting like he doesn't know something he knows is different. There's no reason for him to do this. 

3- Why didn't Eren tell Historia about this? Instead of saying I will destroy the world, it is more logical to say ""I will destroy the world, but as a result, the titan powers will be wiped out"". 

 Sometimes I see arguments like this. ""Eren didn't purposely mention it because that would be a spoiler"". There can be no such storytelling. 

&#x200B;

 Founding Titan is a god of the Eldians. She can change their DNA. She can change their minds. She can control time. She can create whatever she wants. She can even raise the dead if she wants to. Just like She did to the scout in the final. So whatever the founding titan wants, the attack on titan story develops in that way. I don't take other races into account. It doesn't add much to the story.  The founding titan was always under Ymir's control. So the person who is god is ymir. Ymir continues to use this power even after her death. The main parasite is in Ymir's body. And Ymir becomes the consciousness of this parasite. After Ymir dies, her daughters eat her corpse and the parasite multiplies. Since we call people with this parasite the Eldians, Ymir can control all Eldians. 

 But Ymir is a slave. Ymir's wish is to follow orders from the royal family. So royal blood has no feature or difference. Just because of ymir's mental state. She chooses to serve the royal family of the Eldia empire. So what shaped the story were orders from the royal family. If this were not Ymir's will, the Eldians would not have free will. Because no matter what they do, Ymir's wish will come true. They are all puppets for ymir to fulfill her purpose. But since Ymir herself is a puppet, the Eldians have free will.

 Ymir can also see the future. But I think this is limited.  The tree in Paths represents the eldians. After Ymir's daughters ate Ymir's corpse, there are three branches on that tree. Those three branches are memories of Ymir's daughters. Since time works differently in Paths, all the memories of those girls are there. So Ymir sees their future too. But here comes the logic. So Ymir can't see the memories of someone who hasn't been born yet. So, for example, ymir didn't see Mikasa's memories before she was born. You can think of how Eren Kruger talked about Mikasa and Armin before they were even born. Because all the memories of grisha are in paths. Since Grisha also knows mikasa and armin, there are memories of mikasa and armin in that tree. 

 Now let's come to eren and ymir. Before Eren could activate the founding titan, he wanted to destroy the entire world and was determined to do so. So Eren considered all possibilities. He was seriously going to destroy the whole world and he didn't know he was going to die, so he didn't decide what to do next. How would he be with his friends after what he had done? He would be dead in a few years anyway. 

 The fact that Eren stops voluntarily creates many gaps in the story. 

 Why did it stop? Why would a person who killed 80% of the world feel sorry for the rest? If he had destroyed the entire outside world, there was no need for him to make his friends heroes. He could even shut them down until the rumbling was over. His friends wouldn't have suffered many traumas. It's like connie killing daz and samuel. 

 Why didn't he turn the soldiers who turned into titans back to human form? There's no harm in doing this 

 Why did Eren let Hange die? He could have prevented this very simply. 

 There are explanations about this that I don't find satisfactory. ""Eren learned he was going to be stopped so he changed his plan and made his friends look like heroes"" If eren is controlling the founding titan, that's total bullshit. Because the person stopping him is himself. And we know that Eren's plan was to complete the rumbling. If Eren learns that he will be stopped after activating the founder, there is someone who will stop him against his will. Ymir is the only person who can do this. He couldn't have started the rumbling, anyway, if Ymir didn't want to.

&#x200B;

 As I said before, the story should be shaped according to Ymir's wishes. But since she is a puppet, it has no effect on the story. But after eren, ymir is no longer a puppet. Ymir made a choice. If Mikasa kills Eren, she too will be freed from her love for the king. So the story should be shaped accordingly. Because as I said, she is always in control of this power. If she didn't have it, there would be no such thing as royal blood being able to use the Founder's power.  

 For Mikasa to kill Eren, Mikasa must have a reason. Destroying the outside world is a reason for mikasa. So Ymir let Eren destroy the outside world. Do not get me wrong. Ymir is not forcing Eren to do this. Eren already wanted it. Eren is lucky. Because what Ymir wants is to allow Eren to destroy the outside world. So that's why rumbling is possible. 

 ***Why didn't the soldiers who turned into Titans turn into humans?***  Because this can prevent Mikasa from killing Eren. First of all, Mikasa has to kill Eren completely on her own will. Because Ymir wants to see the choice she will make. Mikasa needs other members of the alliance to reach Eren. If those titans return to humans, it will complicate the situation. Those soldiers can fight the jeagarists. Because it's their fault they're titans.  Besides, most of the titans are high-ranking soldiers of paradis. So if there is a civil war in Paradis at that moment, Armin Mikasa and the others will deal with this situation. Besides, we don't know that the soldiers who turned into that human will want to stop Eren. So they might want to stop alliance. So they must die.

 **Eren's conversation with all the Eldians**. Eren is giving this speech because he has to state his intentions. If Mikasa does not know that Eren will destroy the outside world, she will not go to kill him. Armin saw all the wall titans in action. But armin's saying ""maybe eren can destroy the whole world"" is not a sufficient reason to stop eren. No one will try to stop Eren for this.

 **Hange's death.** Judging from Eren's conversation with Armin, I don't think Eren knew about Hange's death. This is not for sure, but he probably doesn't know. Because hange is an important person for both eren and armin. When Eren talks about what he has done (the parts where he says he dragged his friends to war), he can say ""hange died because of me"". Since Eren does not control the Titans, he cannot prevent Hange's death.      

  **Eren's speech on the plane.** Here, Reiner suspects that Eren wants to be stopped. Because he could have stopped them if he wanted to. If Mikasa thinks that Eren wants to be stopped, killing Eren will be a choice that Eren will make, not Mikasa's choice.  That's why eren tells them ""you can only stop it by killing me""  He also has Ymir with him while he says this. But Mikasa still hasn't made the decision to kill Eren.

 **Why did the rumbling stop and why did the ancient titans help the alliance?** Like I said, mikasa's killing eren should be done in normal ways. So for Mikasa, Eren needs to lose the battle with the alliance. Why does the rumbling stop and why do the old titans help the alliance? Can Zeke provide that? Of course no. But the alliance doesn't know this. The Alliance doesn't know that royal blood doesn't matter anymore. So it's normal for the alliance to have zeke help them and rumbling to stop when he dies. They don't question it. Ymir brings Armin to Zeke on purpose. Armin is talking to zeke. Zeke's mind is changing and he's helping the alliance. As I said, the person who stopped the rumbling and got the old titans to help the alliance is actually Ymir. Already during this battle, we constantly see Ymir. We never see Eren's face.

 **Mikasa's dream.** Armin transforms into a titan and explodes everything. But Mikasa has to kill Eren. Remember Mikasa still hasn't said that she will kill Eren. Connie Jean Gabi and the others transform into titans. Eren is not dead and is going to fight armin. Everyone is constantly saying that this will not end unless the eren dies. So mikasa needs to kill eren but she's still not sure if she can do it. Mikasa has a headache again. Based on the extra pages, I think these headaches are caused by Ymir looking at Mikasa's thoughts. Mikasa has a headache again before having her dream with Eren in chapter 138. We know that Mikasa wondered what would have happened if she had given a different answer that day in chapter 123. Ymir also shows her what would happen in a different reality. We don't know if something like this would have happened if Mikasa had actually given a different answer. Because this is a reality created by ymir according to mikasa's wishes. We also saw in the extra pages that ymir also imagined a different scenario, just like mikasa. She wished that she would let the king die and be with her daughters.  So that's why she might have shown this reality to Mikasa.  Mikasa chooses to kill Eren. After that, it doesn't matter.  Mikasa doesn't need to know where Eren's head is . Ymir is a god. It can make that happen.   

  **Only ymir knows.** Mikasa's killing of Eren frees Ymir. Ymir bears witness to this, freeing herself from her toxic love for the king. Didn't Ymir already know this when Mikasa was born? Yes, she knew. But the important thing for ymir is to witness it with her own eyes. This event has to happen. Likewise, Ymir knew that Eren would come to Paths and say those words. But she waited for Eren to say those words. So why did eren answer armin as ""only ymir knows""? He could have told Armin that ""mikasa killing me affected Ymir"". He could not give such an answer because Eren does not know that it will be Mikasa who kills him. Eren thinks he will probably die because of the explosion that Armin will create. Eren says ""I don't know **yet**"" in this panel. This is important because it means that he will learn in the future. He probably learns about this when he looks at Mikasa in Chapter 138. Maybe he could see Ymir behind Mikasa too.  So after the beginning of rumbling, it's not a scene prepared by eren for ymir. A scene prepared for mikasa by Ymir. 

 So eren did not stop on his own will. As I said, if ymir wanted to do what eren said, eren would have destroyed the entire outside world and no one could stop him. In other words, when Eren activated the founder, he learned that he lost. I think losing and dying completes Eren's character arc. Because in this story, those who move forward with selfish desires always lose. Just as Erwin can't see the basement, just as nobody knows about the sacrifice the shadis have made. Even Alliance. It's  Like grisha and kruger motivated by hate and losing . As Gross said, if Grisha had been successful, he would have done exactly what the Marleys did. He wanted to show them the real devil. Eren Kruger also turned the Eldians into titans for the good of the Eldians. But what they did was completely in vain. The organization they founded was caught because they wanted to use a child as a puppet for their own purposes 

 Do not conclude from what I wrote that ymir is manipulating eren. The reason why Eren destroyed the outside world is because Karl Fritz built those walls. The reason why Karl Fritz did this is because of the sins committed by the Eldians. We can even say that Ymir did a favor to Eren. Because the best option for Eren is to die. 

 Here is the result: Eren's plan to make them look like heroes is a complete lie. Eren makes up such a lie because he knows he will be stopped and cannot complete the rumbling. Just like the lie he told mikasa and armin. He knows about Mikasa's headaches and ackermann powers and tells a convincing lie. Likewise, when he activates the founder, he learns these and tells a lie to armin. A believable lie, according to the events. But armin still suspects eren. Armin ""Did you really do all this for us?"" says. Because, looking at what happened, he knows that this is a bit silly. 

 **Dina-bertholt-carla**  Everyone who learns this thinks this without thinking. If Eren hadn't manipulated Dina, she would have eaten Bertholt. Eren could also use the founding titan by touching the dina. But it's not that simple. Because it is impossible for him to do this. If Carla lives, Grisha may not give the Founding Titan to Eren. If grisha doesn't give the founder titan to eren, how will eren be able to use this power? What everyone forgets is that the real reason grisha took over the founding titan is because eren manipulated him. Eren manipulated him thanks to Zeke. In other words, even the slightest change in chapter 1-122 can disrupt the relationship between eren and zeke, and eren cannot manipulate his father. For example, this story wouldn't be possible if Reiner and Bertholt didn't tell Zeke about Eren. If Eren wasn't the person he was in chapter 121, would he manipulate his father? Why does this plot twist exist? I think this exists to punish Eren. Eren didn't know that this would be the price of rumbling. As I said, this is not something that Eren does willingly, it's something he has to do. Also, do not infer from what I wrote that eren is in control. Because the parts where Eren uses the power of the founding titan do not prevent Ymir's wishes. Like his conversation with Armin and the others. 

 **Eren's dream in the first episode.**  Eren waking up under the tree is the beginning of the story. In this dream, Eren sees the last memory of Mikasa's dream in chapter 138. Also, this is the part where eren dies and the story ends. Why is this dream so important? Because this dream allows the whole attack on titan story to occur. Mikasa takes the decision to kill Eren and wakes up from this dream. This is not a choice forced upon Mikasa by Ymir. Mikasa does this entirely of her own free will. That's what's important to ymir anyway. So if we didn't take ymir into account and eren was in control, someone asked Mikasa ""if you had to kill eren to stop him, would you do that?"" If it was said, Mikasa would have killed Eren. Mikasa chooses to kill Eren > That's why ymir lets eren destroy the outside world > In order for Eren to destroy the outside world, Grisha must kill the royal family and give the founding titan to Eren >  For this to be possible, what happened in chapters 1-122 must be experienced. So Mikasa's choice to kill Eren in this dream makes everything possible. This dream in chapter 138 is the beginning and also the end of the story",False,False,AttackOnRetards,Mikasa's decision made up the whole story.,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/117lu90/mikasas_decision_made_up_the_whole_story/

I just feel that the problems that I have with the ending are very different to the common consensus, or are very less talked about. So maybe I didn't understand some plot points very well so I thought I might as well ask them here (I would also like to put forward things I didn't like so that we could have a discussion if I interpreted something wrong):

1. Why do people think Eren's character was destroyed? Why is the ""real Eren"" panel so hated in this fanbase? He was just having a vulnerable moment with his friend. He knows he is going to die, and he's going to fulfil his goal no matter what.. He knows he cannot be with Mikasa, can't he have a vulnerable moment expressing the fact that he loves her? I get the that his feelings towards have not been developed as much, but I fail to understand how that panel destroys his character. 

2. With that said, I do believe Eren's 80% plan wasn't logical at all. I'm sure most of us would've predicted it in the alliance chapters (124-129) and I did too, and still then I was hoping that the endgame shouldn't be Eren wanting the alliance united against a common enemy and kill him in the proces.. After killing 80% of the population I don't think people would advocate for peace after watching Eldians and Marleyans unite against a common enemy. They might have had a chance of peace had Eren died before the Rumbling reaching the continent (even that would've been far fetched but would've been more believable for me atleast), but watching their loved ones and almost the whole population die, I don't think anyone would want to repent on their racist attitude and want world peace.

3. I was appalled by the fact that Paradise was bombed and destroyed and thus all our people ultimately getting killed and thus the rumbling was of no use except for letting the current generation live their lives peacefully.... Until very recently I read a comment on this sub saying how 100 years is a very long time (WW2 happened around 70ish years ago) and that the future conflict could've happened for any different reasons. I think now,  I get what Isayama was going for when he drew the extra pages. (But I would like to hear your opinions about it too). 

4. If Eren had obtained the founder, why did he still need Zeke for the rumbling? I had a huge issue with this plot hole that even after the royal connection being broken and Ymir finally being free, Zeke was still important for the rumbling to continue, which didn't make sense to me.

5. Wasn't Zeke trapped in the paths? Suddenly he got out to be killed? 

6. Why did Mikasa pick her scarf up again? And I didn't understand her parallel with Ymir(Can anyone link me a to an explanation?) Watching the latest episode made me realize how much I loved that character when Eren freed her, but in the final battle I absolutely hated her as I was so confused what the fuck did she want?

6. Why do people make such a hue and cry about Reiner sniffing the letter? When I was reading the manga, I got that it was meant for comedic relief, but apparently that dEsTrOyEd his character? How? Reiner's character was consistent throughout the entire series except for just one line which I will describe in point 7. His aftermath wasn't explored, but that was unexplored for all characters. How is it even remotely close to his character getting destroyed?

7. I have to admit some of the dialogue was really bad. Reiner saying ""Eren what a man you are!"", Armin saying ""Thanks for being a mass murderer for us""; Annie, Pieck etc thanking Eren was so so cringe for me even when I was reading the chapter. Why should the warriors be thanking Eren? Seemed very weird to me. (Also, why did Annie's special power hold no relevance in the final battle?)

8. I wasn't a big fan of titans of the past. It was clear enough that Eren was holding back against the alliance or he would have killed them in an INSTANT. When I was reading 136, I was hyped by the spectacle because it looked cool seeing so many Warhammers, armoured titans forming an army, but now that I look back on it, I didn't like the fact that a few shifters (Grisha, Kruger etc) were able to defeat Eren's army. It was at this point (136) when I realised Isayama is rushing things up. 

9. Do any of you think Eren should've 100% gone with the rumbling? If peace talks didn't work before, how was it going to work after killing 80% population? Given how Paradis was destroyed ultimately due to conflict, Zeke's plan would've been better since it doesn't involve killing the future generation of Paradis. But I get that Eren couldn't have known that Paradis would be wiped out so he had to hope for the best in humanity. 

10. Why the hell do some people think Eren would kill his friends to save the island? How does him killing his friends not destroy his character? His main agenda is that he wishes his friends to have long lives. In my opinion, the most logical conclusion would've been Eren making the shifters unable to transform. It would've been in his best interest. 100% rumbling and his friends would also be safe (at the cost of 2 days freedom of his friends XD, I think it's worth it). 

11. I also didn't get how Halluchan died after Eren's head was severed? 

12. This is not regarding the ending, but I after s4e20 I was confused. Why did Grisha leave his home and go ahead with his plan to retake the founder? Was it because he was motivated by small Eren's resolve to explore the outside world or was it because Eren showed him the walls being destroyed? Or was it some other reason? 

13. Why did Historia ask Eren ""what if I have a child?"" I didn't get that part ig. Was the pregnancy plot just so that  the military wouldn't make her a Titan? 

So evidently, my main problems and questions with the ending was regarding the plot, and not regarding the characters. I don't think any of the characters were destroyed. But I do believe Isayama was initially going for 100% rumbling.

Many people absolutely hate the ending so they decided to hate this entire arc. But the ending isn't bad in my opinion, it is just very rushed.

I'm guessing the reason it wasn't explored more because it was an interesting mystery box, better to open at the end, but I wanted more!

He literally become a god. His mental state was already beyond repair in my opinion post-timeskip but I feel like Eren just completely dies when he finally gains the power of the founder. He just becomes a different character entirely. He knows too much.

To be even more self indulgent, I wish the time skip never happened so we could see his entire progression. I wanted to know what it's like for a 15 year old who suddenly learns he's gonna become the antichrist.
What it was like to start realizing your feelings for a girl while knowing how much he's gonna hurt her and how he might even die by her hand. I want to see his friends be the only thing grounding him in reality as a human until he decides to distance himself for good. What's it like to know that all your suffering is your doing? How much would you dehumanize yourself for that?

And honestly I think future Eren wanted younger Eren to dehumanize himself. Not only out of self loathing but because it would become easier to become a devil and commit to the rumbling. In a way he's making it easier for Eren.

This was a rant and I'm probably just projecting these character traits onto Eren so please be kind. I just find these things to be super interesting, whether it's in the actual text or not.

This all super disconnected, but I hope y’all still respond. Thank you for reading this far.

My answer: I personally think season 1 in general is HEAVILY underrated, specifically the female titan arc. I think what season 1 does so well is it portrays fear, anticipation and horror so fucking well. The way some of the female titan chase scenes are directed are so, so incredible. I remember when I first watched season 1 I felt actual adrenaline and anxiety. Watching our main characters go through an expedition beyond the walls for the first time, following Sasha on her horse and the anticipation that at any moment a Titan could appear. The directing and music of when we're watching the female titan chase down Levi's squad was done so masterfully. The story wasn't as complicated but that doesn't make it bad or a weak season at all. The episode called ""Female Titan"" is a rewatch I **HIGHLY** recommend and for me is actually one of the best episodes in the series. And this is from someone who loves dialogue heavy episodes like ""Midnight Sun"" which is my #1 favorite.

From what people have been saying, it looks like one of the linked horizon songs is gonna be the ed of the special, which I’m not too sure will be too fitting. I love Linked Horizon and I couldn’t be more hyped that they are back, but I would prefer that they would be in the opening or play during the battle of heaven and earth.

In the episodic format is where they will put the last titan and Ai Higuchi’s ED.

My main issue with this is that casual watchers will most likely watch one version and never realize there is another with new songs. It’s not too big of a deal, but it would be cool if these songs could be recognized by the whole fanbase. Additionally, when is the episodic format even being released? If it’s a day or longer after the finale, so much of the hype of these songs will be diminished. I really want to hear Ai Higuchi’s song as the credits roll, but we may have a more epic song by LH, which honestly won’t fit the carpet bombing.",False,False,AttackOnRetards,Not a big fan of the special/episode song split,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/17ii76z/not_a_big_fan_of_the_specialepisode_song_split/

### The Doomsday Titan

*A Titan with a body that is more than colossal, with a total length of several hundred meters. Unlike traditional Titans, most of its gigantic body is made up of bones. The countless ribs that extend from the vertebrae become the legs of the giant body, which continues to advance, swaying slowly from side to side, regardless of land or sea. It brings along countless Titans. This Titan, which has swallowed the* [*Attack Titan*](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_Titan_(Anime))*, the* [*War Hammer Titan*](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/War_Hammer_Titan_(Anime))*, the* [*Founding Titan*](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Founding_Titan_(Anime))*, and the* [*Beast Titan*](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Beast_Titan_(Anime))*, would be able to control all* [*Eldians*](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Subjects_of_Ymir_(Anime)) *if its inheritor wished to do so.*

So first of all, ""Doomsday Titan"" is confirmed as the canonical name for Eren's long-ass skeletal nightmare, and I gotta say, that's pretty damn cool. I know some people were already using that name because it had popped up somewhere else before, but now we have 100% confirmation. However, the description also gives us some interesting info:

\- The Doomsday Titan is hundreds of metres long. Cool that we got confirmation, but I wish we also knew how tall it was.

\- It sort of handwaves away the question of ""how did Eren cross the ocean?"" by saying ""regardless of land or sea"". So presumably, it walked on the ocean floor?

\- Eren swallowed Zeke? (man that sounds sus out of context) We did see the hallucigenia absorb or assimilate Zeke in an added shot in the anime after the Paths episodes, and Zeke did say to Armin ""Oh, so Ymir ate you too?"", but it's interesting that they say ""swallowed"". It could be a translational liberty, but also maybe not. If Eren straight up ate Zeke, then he wouldn't have been able to access his royal blood. Therefore, Zeke had to still be alive in some form, or at least not quite dead. I guess ""swallow"" is the right word to use when describing how the hallucigenia assimilated him. Cool that we got confirmation! 

\- ""It would be able to control all Eldians"" – so Ackermanns too, right? This ties into a post I'm going to make after this…

### The Titan flying in the sky

*Unlike common cases of Titan inheritance, Falco became a Pure Titan through Zeke's spinal fluid, and then inherited the Jaw Titan. As a result, in addition to the Jaw Titan, it also developed the characteristics of the Beast Titan, and its claws and jaws took on a shape reminiscent of the beak and claws of a bird of prey. Its biggest feature is the huge wings that grow on both arms. Its huge wings, which can reach a total length of 30 meters when its arms are spread out, have the power to lift its giant body into the sky by flapping them.*

\- This explanation explicitly confirms what was heavily implied during the Annie-Gabi-Falco boat scene explaining that titan shifters can mimic/emulate other powers by ingesting a bit of spinal fluid. That was actually an incredibly clever explanation by Isayama not only to justify why Falco can fly, but also to retroactively explain why Eren, Annie and Zeke can harden.

\- Falco's wingspan is officially given as 30m, which is HELLA WIDE for a Jaw Titan. Unfortunately, like with the Doomsday Titan, I wish they gave us an official height for him as well. Or is it still just the 5 metres that the Jaw usually is?

### The Doomsday Titan - Colossal Titan Ver.

*A Doomsday Titan whose user turned into a Titan after losing most of the Doomsday's body. Since it is the same size as a Colossal Titan and has the same head as the Doomsday Titan, it is thought that it has at least the abilities possessed by the Attack Titan. Even after losing the body, the royal blood, and the Rumbling, it still keeps going. Even if what lies ahead is hell.*

First of all, that final line is awesome and a great callback to Eren's conversation with Falco in Liberio, as well as Armin retorting that ""Eren really loves this hell"" before their fistfight. But more importantly:

\- Weird that the size and head imply that it has the powers of the Attack Titan. What do those two things have to do with each other? 

\- The penultimate line about losing everything but still moving forward is extremely interesting, in my opinion. We know that titan bodies are as big or as small as their inheritor needs it to be, but there are usually limits. For example, Eren can make just a titan arm and Reiner can make an unarmoured titan, but Galliard isn't able to create a 60m tall Jaw Titan. However, this is a unique situation, as Eren's head is the source of his regeneration, and his goal is to keep moving forward (and fight Armin). In keeping with that, it makes sense that to meet those demands, his titan powers worked accordingly and gave him a large body. Funnily enough, I suggested this myself in an [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/u8rasz/addressing_plot_holes_in_the_final_chapters/) two years ago, so it's cool that we got confirmation (not to say that I was the only one who thought of this). Just goes to show that actually using the series' logic to try and find explanations for unexplained things works! Who knew? Certain subreddits didn't, that's for sure.

With the confirmation that Eren's Colossal Doomsday Titan didn't have the Founding Titan, it opens up a whole new can of worms with regards to Mikasa's cabin dream, which I'll posting about later. Just thought I'd share this new info with y'all!
