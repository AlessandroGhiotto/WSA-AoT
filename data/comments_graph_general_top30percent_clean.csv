ProfessorRigby,Herrmann1309,Last week I started to watch AoT with my parents they are now at S4E6 :)
Herrmann1309,whatuzay,Thats awesome. I hope someday my dad would watch it coz it has everything he likes but the only reason he doesnt watch it is coz its anime
whatuzay,Herrmann1309,Just let him watch the first episode maybe he get hocked up
whatuzay,NFahey1,I'm 29 and about to be a dad and I hope my kids will watch it with me!
whatuzay,Alphabunsquad,Yah it‚Äôs a hard show to show to people because either they have already watched it or they won‚Äôt because it‚Äôs an anime and the beginning is the most anime esque of all of it
Herrmann1309,Egglord123,They watched the whole thing in a week? Or like you started off w/ a later season
Egglord123,Herrmann1309,Yea we watched all 3 seasons and the new episodes in around ~10 days
Egglord123,Alstoyle,It's not too impossible. Me and my mother watched all of HunterxHunter in 9 days. now THAT seemed impossible
ProfessorRigby,einsteinwasdumb,Omg COMMANDER PYXIS...
ProfessorRigby,Chisto-Otchki,Doesn't he look kinda like the titan that swallowed Eren?
Chisto-Otchki,Peter_Lim,"I wonder why that titan that ate Eren didn't turn to a normal person like what happened to Ymir?

Edit: thanks for the response guys!"
Peter_Lim,frenchfries089,Santa swallowed Eren and not Chew. This is basically a lesson and why to chew your food. Or humans.
Peter_Lim,kurdish-devil,Because he didn't manage to eat erin's spine
Peter_Lim,Reggie_156789,he didn't bite eren's spine thats why
Peter_Lim,Chisto-Otchki, perhaps Eren just didn't get digested yet
Chisto-Otchki,Rasthulhu10,He could totally pull off a cosplay of that titan or Dot Pixie
Chisto-Otchki,nottherealuncleiroh,That was my first thought!
Chisto-Otchki,Doge_MLG,The karl marx titan
ProfessorRigby,neremarine,"OP lied, that's definitely not two episodes in..."
neremarine,UncleScummy,Two episodes in for the dad maybe
UncleScummy,VigoMago,Tbf tv episodes (~40 to 60 mins) are at least two or three anime episodes
neremarine,memerverse1,No I think it means after 2 episodes he becomes as committed as he is seen in the video
neremarine,ShaidarHaran2,"That's also not OPs dad, this has been reposted several times. 

Why do people think they'll get away with that lol."
neremarine,Yak-Yak-Yak,"This isn't even OP's dad, the video was previously posted by different person."
neremarine,chipthehippie,"Read. They never said ""two episodes in"". Read."
ProfessorRigby,Gandalfonk,"This show is so good, I think it can bring in non anime watchers. People that love Breaking bad or GOT would love this, its in the same vein of dark. Gritty, amazing story telling."
Gandalfonk,TheClintonCartel,"As someone who is not into anime, I am so glad I gave this show a try"
Gandalfonk,thejuicee,It was my first anime and brought me into it. Also my favorite by far.
Gandalfonk,Diablosbane,I started with one punch man and wanted more and fell in love with AoT. The amount of effort they put into making these characters feel alive is crazy.
ProfessorRigby,Vinsmoke_Yagami,a dad of culture
ProfessorRigby,Jashut12,"Mashallah Brother, Eren is my Caliph."
Jashut12,Sikehindunationlist,I'd choose levi or erwin to be my caliph
ProfessorRigby,reddawn28,An honorary survey corps member.
ProfessorRigby,Dexters-Username,Reminds me how my dad got me into anime and I got him into aot and other shows
Dexters-Username,Adiuui,"Fr, my dad introduced me to naruto and I‚Äôve become more of a weeb then he feared, now to me having more access to money I‚Äôm buying more and more anime stuff..."
ProfessorRigby,DOOMFOOL,"Mom said it‚Äôs my turn to repost this, come on"
ProfessorRigby,monferno786,Mashallah
ProfessorRigby,bokechara,"if this is real, its beautiful"
bokechara,ShaidarHaran2,"It's been reposted several times so definitely not OPs dad, but the original may have been legit."

despacito11,CEO_16,"Although the latest episodes were fking amazing, ratings will drop if I'm not wrong, I hope they stay"
CEO_16,shantanu_m28,"Assault should remain at 9.9+. Other 2 should settle around 9.7+ atleast.


The other 4 have some of the best moments of AOT, Erwin's charge, Levi vs Monke, The 'Choice' and all the leadup. And the one with Grisha's memories that explains everything. They'll stay."
shantanu_m28,AkileshZ,levi vs kenny squad was my fav till date.
shantanu_m28,EgocentricRaptor,I thought Declaration of War was better though
shantanu_m28,CEO_16,Yes definitely not the old ones but yeah the new ones
shantanu_m28,Turboswag420,It‚Äôs called Serumbowl
shantanu_m28,Requimics,HEISHI NO SAKEBEEEEEEE... *smashed by rock
CEO_16,_LadyForlorn,"I don't think they will drop too much. The number of votes for all 7 episodes I will list down. 



Hero: 10 - 43K 


Perfect Game: 9.9 - 20K


Midnight Sun: 9.9 - 18K


That Day: 9.9 - 15K 





Declaration of War: 9.9 - 23K


The WarHammer Titan: 9.9 - 18K


Assault: 10 - 24K 





So considerable number of people has already voted and it is holding out pretty well."
_LadyForlorn,CEO_16,Considering hero received 43k and assault already has 24k is literally amazing
CEO_16,Spussyfy,how do ratings drops if i may ask? how does it work?
Spussyfy,CEO_16,"The current ratings are based on few people's ratings, as the number of votes increase, it usually goes down(not everyone's gonna give 10) this is what happened with other major episodes like the winds of winter from GOT, it had 10/10 for almost a month and now it rests on 9.9"
Spussyfy,PewPewLaserss,The first ratings are usually the highest since it's mostly fans of the show that are invested. Later on more regular viewers vote too and they're usually lower. In this case however they really deserve to remain the same
Spussyfy,fistyfishy,"The ratings are an average, if you have 5 people say something is a 9 out of 10, you will have a high average, but if more and more people vote, it essentially becomes more 'accurate' if you will, if something has 10 average with 100 votes, vs 9.6 average with 1000 voters, 9.6 is more accurate because it's less boosted by the ratings of those who vote first. God this is a mess of a comment"
Spussyfy,oVerThiNkSeveRyTing,Also many people who are die hard fans of breaking bad wants their show to be number 1 so that‚Äôs why they would rate aot pretty low to drop their ratings.
CEO_16,DemonAssassin64,"Yeah they probably will, weeks aren't hard to please when something first comes out. Once its finished people will start being more critical"
DemonAssassin64,CEO_16,"Yeah, us being hard-core fans will give 10/10 straightaway"
CEO_16,novayy,"I dont think they'll not drop. Everybody who watches episode after cgi and youseebiggirl drama will be probably like ""OMG THIS WAS A MASTERPIECE 10/10""."
novayy,CEO_16,I hope they don't I seriously do
despacito11,Eddifej,episode 7 definitely deserves 10/10 stars. genuinely amazing
Eddifej,IAmMyOwn_God,"Not really, if the animation was better than past seasons then yes, but it's bad compared to the other seasons"
IAmMyOwn_God,SirDogmeat,"Honestly I don‚Äôt really notice the animation, the only thing I noticed was every being a bit darker but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs even to do with animation"
despacito11,despacito11,These ratings are on imdb (forgot to mention in post) plus the assessment is made by self so any corrections would be helpful
despacito11,calvin426,It‚Äôs also funny because the episode average of FMAB is just 8.3 but the show is rated 9.1. But the episode average of AOT is 9.2 but the show is just rated 8.9
calvin426,The-Biscuit-Farmer,"I think that‚Äôs because of the fact that a person can rate each episode, as well as rating the show as a whole."
despacito11,example_John_phd,"and when you look at the list of top 250 TV shows you see SNK ranks only 51st.

Breaking bad 4th...

Fun Fact: full Metal Alchemist ranks 19th"
example_John_phd,EminemSlimShade,Yeah AoT is severely underrated in user scores for the show but dominating in episode scores
example_John_phd,r3vb0ss,R u saying BB should be lower lol
r3vb0ss,example_John_phd,No.. if anything I'd say it's the unquestionable #1 show ever to grace television.
example_John_phd,Xenophorm12,FMA:B is kinda overrated tho
Xenophorm12,RudolfWinkler,"Its really good, but I like AoT way more, too..."
Xenophorm12,thomas_anderson_1211,"Nah, itbis still the best anime series. AoT is my 3rd favourite."
despacito11,YOLOsometime,"It deserves every single star. I was a little concerned about how this season will be after the season 3‚Äôs reveal. Most shows are not able to deliver after a twist like that. But every single episode leaves me more impressed than the one before. 

Perfect execution! I literally clapped alone while watching s4e7 yesterday."
YOLOsometime,Tinseltopia,"This is why it's much much MUCH better to have a plan in mind before you start a show. He's not making this up as he goes along, there's been foreshadowing and little Easter Eggs the whole way through. Having a plan and executing it will always be better than writing a show season to season.

100% one of the best stories ever told"
YOLOsometime,juntawflo,"I mean, the OST was so intense, there was 10 things happening at the same time, pacing was gold, Gabi's VA and Falco's VA were on a next level, there is so many points to analyse from the episode like:

\- Reiner titan form not complete, his armour  was not totally on him which gave him a much more human form. Nice contrast with Eren loosing slowly his humanity, acting like a pure monster.

\- Armin explosion looked like a sun and then red sun --> The episode in S3 where Armin gets the colossal is called ""Midnight Sun"".

\- Eren big brain energy is out of the chart. I really like the character development of this character (unlike luffy were character pretty never evolve, even after traumatic events)"
juntawflo,Ensaru4,">Reiner titan form not complete, his armour  was not totally on him which gave him a much more human form. Nice contrast with Eren loosing slowly his humanity, acting like a pure monster.

I never considered this angle, and I had months to notice this as I'm a manga-reader. That's a pretty great observation.

>(unlike luffy were character pretty never evolve, even after traumatic events)

I will never understand why people view Luffy this way. Luffy's character has evolved, especially if you go back and read/watch past chapters/episodes. His core character traits didn't, and he does sometimes fall back into his bad habits, but he is a different character compared to back then. His development is just a bit more slow-paced and subtle.

A similar case of this is World Trigger (a high recommendation, by the way), where the main character, Osamu, grows slowly and subtlely throughout the series."
YOLOsometime,carame1sundae,"Yeah, I rewinded the scene where Levi K.Oed the beast titan several times. You know an episode is good when you immediately rewind a scene to admire the beauty of it."
carame1sundae,theursusregem,"I love that the beast titan was like, ‚Äúfounding titan? Not my problem. Where‚Äôs that random human who fucked me up a few years ago?‚Äù"
despacito11,Koolstr,"So glad to see the series get the records and credit it deserves. With the rest of the season to come, and knowing what takes place, I wonder if (and I'm confident) it will get at least a few more on that treasured totem.

Now all it needs is recognition in the form of actual awards."
despacito11,woahysenia,"This season is honestly going out w bang, I can‚Äôt name one negative thing about it"
despacito11,TheKrystalMethod0,WHO RUINED OUR 10.0 AVERAGE? >:E
despacito11,Blackscure,If Season 2 episode 6 isnt one of em imma lose faith lol
Blackscure,Xenophorm12,It's 9.8
Xenophorm12,Blackscure,I mean 9.8 is incredibly great but lower than those mentioned above? That was such an unbelievable good episode combined with the great soundtrack .
despacito11,therealscasm,Deserves it big time
despacito11,yomnot,"AoT and BB are 2 entirely different things, I wouldn't compare those. Also the number of votes for BB is way way more."
yomnot,oooshyguy,Just a comparison of two highly rated shows that‚Äôs all. Making the fact there‚Äôs 7 for AOT at the moment even more impressive.
yomnot,Bigfish150,I can say that they belong together as the two greatest shows ever though.
Bigfish150,yomnot,Both of them are definitely top tier but greatest show is a very big claim.
despacito11,jamalboi,Man the next episode's rating will be taking a beating harder than the Warhammer titan
despacito11,chronoboy1985,"I always take IMDB and pretty much any polling website with a hefty grain of salt what with the advent of review bombing a fan-herd mentality (hunter x Hunter is somehow #40 all time, seriously?), that said this season will definitely go down in anime history as one of the best single seasons ever and AoT will be remembered as a top 10, or even top 5 anime GOAT. Suprisngly, I mostly agree with their top 100 shows. Well about 80% of it. Not sure if I‚Äôd have a bunch of Earth documentaries clogging the top 20. Blue Planet and Cosmos certainly."
despacito11,Kellythejellyman,"part of me would say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just that this season is hype AF‚Äù but really i agree with all of it


Also: [EREH GOTTA GET SUM SIIIIIIIP](https://youtu.be/M1TcsG_YhLE)"
despacito11,ReebornTurtle,My heart was pounding in my chest most of the episode. I'm gutted this is the final season. AoT will forever be an anime masterpiece. Better than Code Geass which up until recently was my recommendation for people who want a mature story in Anime.
despacito11,Christoffer2404,**Attack on Titan** is also the only series with 2 episodes at 10/10 stars with Hero from season 3 part 2 and the new episode Assult.
despacito11,Mr_Aestheticss,wow spoiler much? please add one
Mr_Aestheticss,despacito11,Done
despacito11,whutwat,that's because anime audience is less critical and diverse than BB's... aka consists mostly of teenage fanboys that raid imdb with 10/10 scores
despacito11,zooplorp,"Honestly imdb scores don't mean shit. In addition, breaking bad has been out for years, while these episodes have mostly only been touched by the excited fans."
despacito11,crowbird_,Breaking Bad is still the best anime
despacito11,wickedsickuser,where are these ratings from?
wickedsickuser,despacito11,Imdb
despacito11,Battekha,oh boy i have some news to tell you
despacito11,urPantsNotMine,Those aren't even going to be the best episodes I've read all the manga and trust me it gets waaaaay better
despacito11,jwaters0122,"the next 4-5 chapters are most likely going to be dialogue-heavy so it'll dip down a bit, but not by much"
despacito11,flashcon2109,Assault gave us brief look at the new look for the armoured Titan and in my opinion it‚Äôs the best episode of attack on Titan so far
flashcon2109,Raix12,Is it his new look though? I thought he just transformed in a sort of weakened state so he didn't get his full armor.
Raix12,flashcon2109,He had spikes on his shoulders
despacito11,Sheamurp,Attack on Titan is such a masterpiece
despacito11,MajinSkull,I just told me brother these past 3 episodes are probably the best I‚Äôve seen in any anime
despacito11,HannCanCann,"shouldn't have bought attention to this, now the ""fans"" will downvote them, reason - ""mApPa Is DoInG a TeRrIbLe JoB"", bla bla bla."
HannCanCann,despacito11,Yes..but hopefully this sub is full of pro fans
despacito11,psychoghost847,I really like the last episode but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best episode of the show
despacito11,Electric_Bagpipes,"Give it a few months for more realistic ratings to come in, then you can brag."
despacito11,THEKING07JB,Where do I vote
THEKING07JB,despacito11,The ratings are from imdb website..you can vote either on website or app
despacito11,gobthepumper,The only down side of Assault was how anticlimactic Levi killing Zeke was.  Like I am hesitant to even say Zeke is dead after how little attention was paid to it but ya Eren getting the War Hammer Titan was fucking godlike.
despacito11,Portgust,What page is this?
despacito11,suti_swiss,Question is how much peopelnare raitings fot them^^ i love brebra and aot but voted not ^^ oke aot i voted
despacito11,HariShane,And this is why ISAYAMA SAN is GOATED!!
despacito11,Majestymen,"To be fair, Breaking Bads episodes are a lot longer in length. These three episodes could probably fit in one long BB episode. So they may only have 4 episodes with 9.9 or more, but they have more minutes of 9.9 content than SnK currently has."
despacito11,AxelIce,And just you wait!
despacito11,sirvee_sinister,And we're not come even halfway the season
despacito11,KSI-our-Fatneek,And people say anime is bad...
despacito11,AR15sAndShitV2,"I‚Äôm a little disappointed with some of the CGI with the Titans moving. It looks... Cheap? It just has this look that seems to be of lower quality. The story is great, but not 9.9/10 great"
despacito11,AlexisAncrath,"As much as they are great, I'm going to be honest: I don't think they deserve 9.9. Anyway i'm just happy that at least they are very well received and that this show gets the recognition that it needs"
despacito11,thedickkicker,Who would have thought an Anime would beat breaking bad in awesomeness
despacito11,XylanyX,the next arc is politic soo it would probably drop but still on the 8 to 9 area
despacito11,Dsb0208,"Look, I love AoT, I really do, but all of these being 9.9 out of 10? It's still an amazing show, but kind of over rated. The animation, while in some areas is amazing, can look kinda janky. This mostly came in episode 7, which had IMO the worst done Titan moment, and the best.

When Falco first comes out from the wreckage, and we see a cgi Erin, and then immediately cut to the animated Falco, it's a little jarring, but at the same time the hand drawn Armin Titan was amazing. 

Of course this is just my personal opionion, but if I had to say, episode 5 gets an 8/10. episode 6 a 8.7/10, and episode 7 can keep it's 10/10

Edit: and of course I get downvoted first saying that something isn‚Äôt 10/10. If you guys can‚Äôt take criticism when I give my personal opinions, about a show that you guys didn‚Äôt make, then I fee sorry for you. FYI, the downvote button isn‚Äôt an ‚ÄúI disagree‚Äù button"
Dsb0208,McJarvus,"I agree. MAPPA's doing good right now and they nailed that one transformation scene, but the CG really prevents these episodes from being a 10/10 for me. Eren's titan looks a bit too off and goofy and personally kind of made a lot of the scenes feel less serious than in the manga. It's still a phenomenal episode but what would make it 10/10 is if MAPPA were given enough time to make well-made 2d fight scenes that they're capable of. It's great that they made this given the time constraints, but imagine these same episodes with the animation quality of season 1."
Dsb0208,yamankutmawi,"I don't know where we got this ""overrated"" concept from. It's just rated. People rated an episode this way because they enjoyed it. Just like how you're saying it's your opinion that the other episodes are less enjoyable, other people's opinions got these episodes the higher scores. Just rate the way you want, and don't influence or be influenced by other people's words whether it's hate or praise."
despacito11,LuisAntony2964,awesome
despacito11,Loveufelix,As it should!
despacito11,TheSurvivor__O,"So they're are Atleast two episodes with a perfect 10
And 3 of the top episodes from a single season that ain't even finished airing

Dammmn isayama how much masterpieceness will you add"
despacito11,Lion-666,"Amazing episodes so far, I can't wait for the next one, a week feels like a year."
despacito11,olio272,"This considering all the toxicity and the negative feedback on the animation.

Imagine they used proper artwork instead of CGI, they have to create a new rating system thats out of 20 to match the hype"
despacito11,listpet,To those people going on about the CGI: I hadn't even noticed it until it was pointed out to me. Mappa did a bloody good job of it.
despacito11,liquid-claw,The ratings are inflated.
despacito11,thomas_anderson_1211,Deceleration of war is better than actual Battle of marlaya imo.
despacito11,Vinzan,"There'ss a certain manga chapter that when adapted into the anime, I'm sure it will appear up there."
despacito11,slumpshack,Assault was definitely one of the best it was such a satisfying episode eren with his analytical side and levi not even giving zeke a moment of screen time mappa blessed us once again
despacito11,THC_Induced,I remember last time someone posted this they also had a pic of breaking bad and they review bombed it with a 0/10. Don‚Äôt be like that people. Breaking Bad is great television!
THC_Induced,despacito11,Yes..no comparison with BB..it is just to show that it has more highy rated episodes than top rated imdb show.
despacito11,despacito11,And unfortunately i can't edit the post
despacito11,cootershooter420,well it is literally the best television show of all time so yeah
despacito11,Ukis4boys,This is how u make a revenge story with 2 sides. Tlou2 take notes
despacito11,WyrmWood815,"PROBABLY should spoiler mark this. Just for people who haven‚Äôt seen the newest episodes, as this shows the whole summary of them."
WyrmWood815,despacito11,Done
despacito11,Silver-Fang-Bang,"Cause it‚Äôs fire, idk why everyone is bitching about it like it‚Äôs hot garbage. 

But hey my handle is silver fang and well we all know what happened to One Punch Man season 2, that was something to be mad over."
despacito11,jacktheknife15,Everybody is hyping it up but my Crunchyroll sub ran out and I can‚Äôt find a place to watch it :(

ZukosScar0219,CaptainSmeg,Does this mean Gabi‚Äôs getting eaten by Santa Titan in a couple episodes time?
CaptainSmeg,AsuraNiche93,How much I wish this is the next plot. I hate that brat.

OISHOESSKE,SpiritMountain,"I love when artists and authors do this, especially in visual mediums. 

There is a huge major one in One Piece and it is amazing how many years passed and well thought out it was."
ZukosScar0219,Japesh691,When you realise that's what pains theory on cycle of hatred
Japesh691,CaptainBoomerang1,God now I'm scared the last fight will be like that loonytoons shit that they did for Naruto v pain
CaptainBoomerang1,Japesh691,Naah bro that talking part is complete with reiner and eren when he said I am same as you... And what the fuck you mean by lonnytoon shit that was Hella good pain vs naruto

ZukosScar0219,ubiasedhoodfriend,"I just can't feel bad for them bro, only Falco he cool. Reiner too, but like fuck him but he cool lol"
ZukosScar0219,Neo99x,Madara speech is at work here
ZukosScar0219,lolbabygirltop,"I mean yes but not really. Marleyans constantly attack Eldians for no reason. Gabi already hated the titans but for no particular reason other people than the Marleyans telling them that they should be ashamed of having their blood.

Eren on the other hand only wanted to be free from the walls and live a happy life instead of one like cattle. The titans attacked the wall and ended up killing his family. After that day Eren has a hate for Titans but in reality it‚Äôs the people of Marley since they are the ones who sent the pure titans around the walls and sent the Colossal and Armored titan. 

Gabis hurt and frustration would be avoided if only the Marleys let the Eldians mind their business and never killed Erens mom."
ZukosScar0219,Starkky-,"Someone should make a meme about ""Hi Obito From AOT"" ""Hi Zofia From Naruto"" And The below the picture of both getting crushed by a boulder"
Starkky-,mswamp96,zofia is just doing the caesar challenge
ZukosScar0219,cc_donohue,"nah fuck Marley, all my homies hate Marley"
cc_donohue,liveart,"Seriously. The fact that people are both sides-ing with what are essentially Nazis is nuts. Sure violence can be cyclical however: Marley *didn't* stop the the Titans, the Eldian king did. The Eldian's didn't *constantly* attack Marley to the point they were trapped behind a series of walls to not be fucking eaten. The Eldian's are not engaging in rounding up an entire ethnicity into ghettos, treating them as subhuman, and literally forcing them on suicide runs to attack their enemies.

The Eldian's also didn't declare war *despite* all of the justifications Marley has given them. Once war was declared all bets were off, there were always going to be civilian casualties that's just war. Especially if you look at the history of war where wiping out an entire city was just considered good tactics, it's only our modern sensibilities that have a problem with civilian casualties and even that is very conditional/limited.

Marley is clearly the bad actor here, even to the extent that they literally knew this would happen and were *counting on* the casualties to create a **bigger** conflict."
liveart,cc_donohue,couldnt have said it better myself
liveart,MSPaintIsntHard,"Agreed. It's a vicious back-and-forth, but it all started somewhere. Before either party was backed into their corner, the Marleyans had the chance to stop conflict - both with the foreign Paradisians and the domestic Eldians - and they chose not to over and over again.

In other words: they fucked around, and now they're finding out."
liveart,soursoap,"I do want to point out that it's the evolution and modernization of war into ""total war"" that produces so many civilian casualties. In fact, civilian casualty was considered an essential part of the war strategy. WWI was the big starting point of war becoming all-encompassing, so it's completely possible that's what Yams intended. See Gwynne Dyer's documentaries on Total War for the full explanation - how he describes the horrors of total war has very much the same vibes as the war horrors that the Eldia/Marley arc does."
liveart,chowler,"Marley's hypocrisy on how they have treated the common Eldian is a focal point of the series. The Tybur family makes specific references to this.

Let me reiterate, Marley is not a saint or even close to being the ""good guys"". Due to the fantasy nature of AoT, it's hard to use real life examples (Nazis, North Korea, American slavery, Post 9/11 America) as 1:1 comparisons.

But think about this from a military standpoint. Your life long enemy, who ruled you with an iron fist for generations, says they are withdrawing their forces and if you keep fighting, they will use their nuclear arsenal to destroy the world. They also have the ability to explode bombs planted all across your country should they choose to. 

How long do you feel safe for, knowing should that leader go back on their word, you are for all intents and purposes dead and your country is dead? Your people were second class citizens for ages and suddenly you should trust the leader who ruled treated you as such?"
liveart,Narwhals4Lyf,"I think a lot of the focus is how easy it is to be propagandized, not that Marley is good"
cc_donohue,fudgelord1,It would be fine if they weren't putting all the eldians in gulags and peeing on them for fun
fudgelord1,liveart,I mean... would it? Even if they treated the eldians fine they're a violent expansionist regime that runs on terrorizing their neighbors with monsters until they're subjugated.
cc_donohue,DanielCampos411,"The whole ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no bad guys, just 2 sides of the fight‚Äù is false honestly. This can all trace back to Marly oppressing the hell out of Eldians and brainwashing everybody into thinking that every person on the Island is a devil. That‚Äôs what it boils down to."
DanielCampos411,souaiway,lol. remember 100 years ago when Eldians terrorized the world and were eating people and toppling civilizations? Marley ‚Äústopped‚Äù them (we now know it was actually king fritz and the tyburs that stopped the fighting but the world didnt know that) and were the good guys in the worlds eye and soent the ensuing years punishing the Eldians for what their ancestors did. you just cannot just boil down the cycle of war and violence to one county/person. everyone has their motivations/beliefs
DanielCampos411,DanIsTrash,that logic is kinda dumb because then it can be traced back to eldians oppressing marley before marley took over
cc_donohue,WingedBeing,"Hatred of the nation is different from hatred of the people. These guys grew up with a totally different perspective than what we have. To them, Eldians are a race of beings that were only just recently deposed from their status as horrible tyrants. And as far as we know, *they are correct.*

What they did not know is that King Fritz renounced war and retreated with his followers to Paradis of his own accord. For all the Marleyans knew, in fact for all the *world* knew, the will of the King was to eventually trample the world beneath a million Colossal Titans. This is not true, of course. But as can be seen by the sheer shock that the denizens of the planet elicited at learning the truth, this was a hard boiled lie which they all took as fact. To them, this was the reality: the Eldians are a race of monsters in the form of men, and one day their king will return with the power to level the planet in a genocidal rage. Of course they hate the Eldians and want to restrain them as much as possible: they don't want the Eldians on the mainland to be willful soldiers that might want to join their king in his personal Armageddon. 

That all being said, from what we've seen the plan was never to massacre the people of Shiganshina or wall Rose. It looks like the plan went fubar and Reiner took things into his own hands. The plan was simply to locate and take back the Founding Titan: they did not have much information about what they would find when they got there. The top brass gave them a mission; it was up to Bertholdt, Annie, and Reiner to decide how to carry it out ESPECIALLY since their leader was chomped way early into the expedition.

Eren essentially proved Willy *correct.* Willy said that Eren was dangerous with the power of the Founding Titan and he could not be trusted to use the power responsibly, unlike the royal lineage. He said he was coming to kill them all, and Eren punctuated that statement by killing them all."
cc_donohue,Cpt_Callisto,"True, true. Humans are evil they're getting what they deserve"
montgomeryyyy,boieth,"How many women and children died during shinganshina, trost, Maria, etc as far as conflict goes Eren is being pretty precise with who is dying, with everyone aside from flock attempting to keep civilian casualties low"
montgomeryyyy,AppellationSpawn,Yes
ZukosScar0219,Neo99x,But still am on team eren üòÇ
ZukosScar0219,eatsnsleepsred,"I think this is a double edged sword because king fritz did try to end the cycle. He took the Eldians to paradis, created the walls, and wiped out their memories so they couldn‚Äôt commit the atrocities that they did before. If the marleyans never attacked paradis with pure titans and the warriors, eldians would have never learned about titans, their history, ymir,the bloodlines, etc."
ZukosScar0219,deboytimo,"Honestly, for me it‚Äôs really hard to feel bad for the warriors. They glorify the people who did the exact same thing. And now Gabi is in shock? I‚Äôm 99% sure Gabi would have even enjoyed it if the roles were reversed."
deboytimo,VaiFate,"Yeah. I get the parallels but when the warriors attacked *Shiganshina*, Eren was just a spunky kid. When Eren attacked Liberio, Gabi was already a child soldier responsible for the deaths or hundreds."
VaiFate,deboytimo,Jup and the fact that Eren‚Äôs home got destroyed and almost everyone he knew was dead without a good reason. Paradise did nothing wrong at that point.
VaiFate,inxinitywar,Gabi and all of the warriors have been brainwashed since birth to know only one thing. The eldians are inferior and the eldians on paradise island are devils and need to be killed. The kids have been used and abused their whole lives into fighting an unjustifiable war so I have a lot of sympathy for most of them.
deboytimo,Gwain96,"Maybe, but she did show extreme concern upon nearly learning at dinner that the Paradis Devils were normal people. If her family hadn't shut Reiner up, he might have kept talking and disillusioned her by accident."
ZukosScar0219,gunslinger_mk,I mean Eren didn‚Äôt kill anybody at that point yet...Gabi was already a murderer.
ZukosScar0219,Blitz_Prime,"I don't think a lot of people are getting the point of ""The cycle never ends"" or the parallels between this and the first episode.

Sure Eren had justification and Marley had it coming, but by continuing the actions and Crimes, all it's going to do is create a new Eren in the form of Gabi. All her friends were crushed right in front of her, for all she knows her parent could be dead, and the too Marlain guards her were kind to her and her friends were killed in front of her as they were trying to get out of harms way. It's why this season isn't really presenting anyone as good or bad guys, just people with different beliefs.

Until someone tries something different, regardless of who deserves it or not the tunnel vison of hate that Eldians, Marlains and Manga readers have wont end until someone tries to find another way, regardless of how difficult it may be. Nothing good comes easy.

There's a reason half of the Manga community >!have been chanting for the death of a 12 year old girl !<until Eren >!started his genocide campaign.!<"
Blitz_Prime,I_Am_Dwight_Snoot,Manga spoilers >!Falco and Gabi do a great job with ending the cycle though so far. Falco nuts up with Gabi and Gabi realizes that the world isn't black and white.!<
I_Am_Dwight_Snoot,Blitz_Prime,"That's too. Plus >!Eren is technically doing a good job with ending the cycle too. Since, you know...!<"
ZukosScar0219,Jznaveed,"I feel like Gabi still has a lot for her though. Her parents are still alive and so is most of her community.Hell, Reiner is still probably alive. Eren had to see his own mother be eaten and became an orphan overnight."
ZukosScar0219,The_Thanoss,I gotta say >!I don‚Äôt think people are gonna be able to fight back against Eren!< (Manga spoilers)
ZukosScar0219,Reggie_156789,war... war never changes.
ZukosScar0219,Staleztheguy,"Gabi still was hyped to kill enemies she KNEW were actual humans(THE dynamite she had tied to her ankles)

Even was hyped to kill those that LITERALLY looked like monsters.

Fuck gabi."
ZukosScar0219,itachiuchiha5,Nah fuck gabi annoying ass character all my homies rate falco
itachiuchiha5,LoliArmrest,Fuck them kids
ZukosScar0219,shareefshoes,Oh my god
ZukosScar0219,BladerRex17,"These parallels are honestly amazing. The cycle of Hatred and Pain keeps repeating itself, Pain from Naruto really was spitting facts.

&#x200B;

Edit: Honestly can't stop thinking about these parallels, they're so amazing and well done, really looking forward to future eps"
ZukosScar0219,GottaBumbleMyDude,"Has Eren's Attack Titan always looked so...monstrous? I know the animation studio changed - and MAPPA's Titan animation is gnarly - but especially in the upper right picture, the eyes and mouth make him look absolutely terrifying."
ZukosScar0219,unixverese,i felt so bad for zofia and udo :(

Mafetan,Road_Whorrior,Oh I knew >!we wouldn't see him til the very end. Once he started the Rumbling the only way to tell the story is to hold Eren's POV hostage until the conclusion.!<
Lennus123,HUNAcean,"I mean there is only 1 epispde left, so it's more and more likely that we'll have to wait a year for part 3 to see Ereh. And if it's a movie, only Ymir knows how long before they publish that outside of Japan"

nematjon_isthe1,Mafetan,"He brought a game boy he found in Marley with him, he‚Äôs chill."
Mafetan,nematjon_isthe1,Isn't Zeke with him lol. Eren got him front row seats to watch the whole world get stepped on.
Mafetan,KOsanesome,Do you think he's playing Legend of Zelda or Pokemon
nematjon_isthe1,Neamow,Just singing The Rumbling in his head.
Neamow,Quack445,Aren't we all?
nematjon_isthe1,-NotActuallySatan-,"""Does Mikasa like me, like actually like me?

.......

Nah, she's probably just being nice."""
nematjon_isthe1,ShaidarHaran2,"I had the thought that his whole ""I just keep moving forward"" motto becomes terrifying with this beast he became. I'm guessing that's what he would be single mindedly thinking, if he is truly gone all bad, but I still think there's room for another twist to his plan where uniting both sides of Eldians under the watch of the world is what ends the cycle of hate and perhaps killing the parasite thing out in the open ends all titans."
ShaidarHaran2,HanBr0,I‚Äôve been thinking that it‚Äôs setting up a Code Geass type ending ever since the group came together and I‚Äôm honestly really hoping we‚Äôre both wrong. I would love to see Eren just fall to that cycle of hatred and just be fueled by nothing but wanting to protect his friends. Seeing his friends stop him and the world witness that would have more impact imo. It‚Äôd be a tragic end to the character we grew to love as well as a bittersweet victory for Eldia/Paradis.
ShaidarHaran2,inORIGINAL-NAME,Wait are you an anime watcher?
nematjon_isthe1,kkeross,Exactly lol is he just watching the ground or something??
nematjon_isthe1,inORIGINAL-NAME,Probably just sitting there with Zeke And Ymir waiting for the rumbling to end.
nematjon_isthe1,MrWolf_MRW,"Hes just fucking with people using the founder

‚ÄúHmm yes i will turn this random eldian into a mutant that seems funny‚Äù"
nematjon_isthe1,Yoyo3457yt,"

nematjon_isthe1,BigBadRhinoCow,He is like a guy driving a street sweeper vehicle along the side of the road and whistling.
nematjon_isthe1,sentry_ahead,he is probably controlling the wall titans to go out of the paradis because if not controlled why wouldn't they kill the paradis people too salt titans do it
nematjon_isthe1,Illustrious_Gear_282,"for real. even if you are so determined to commit an inmoral act like world genocide,wonder what he has though all that time"
nematjon_isthe1,idkdidkkdkdj,Just looking at the beautiful scenery of course
nematjon_isthe1,xKiLzErr,Bro's probably making the titans throw flips and break dance to keep himself entertained
samgo88,b0objuice,Don't forget about Zeke disappearing just like that lol
b0objuice,Savant_OW,"Hange mentioned how she thought zeke had been ""absorbed"" by Eren"
b0objuice,CrominusGD,you can see the parasites tentacles catching zeke when eren started transforming btw
CrominusGD,b0objuice,Oh yeah I did notice that you see the tentacle thing going over Zeke at the very beginning of the transformation. I didn't really realize that they were grabbing him though.
b0objuice,HUNAcean,"I mean he was literally next to the walls as they came down plus the biggest titan in history transformed in his palms. That'll take out a human no problem.


Of course it's manga/anime, meaning no corpse no death, but I think we're supposed to think he died"
HUNAcean,ClinicalOppression,I think we're supposed to think he was grabbed by erens titan like how we saw a whole shot of him being grabbed by erens titan...
samgo88,kareemelsubaie55,well he‚Äôs in the preview for next episode so i‚Äôm excited about that
kareemelsubaie55,alextheelf24,last episode of the season :(
alextheelf24,kareemelsubaie55,yeah :( AND we have to wait two weeks for this one. hopefully they announce a part 3 or a movie soon
kareemelsubaie55,GarfieldHentaixd,Where can i see that
kareemelsubaie55,kimbolll,Wasn‚Äôt the preview all flashbacks tho üòÇ
samgo88,AmazingTowelOfficial,Eren is now officially a herringbone

sleeplessorion,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"Broke: Where Eren

samgo88,samgo88,He probably keeps moving forward

samgo88,destroyer1134,"He's just walking, not to exciting"
samgo88,Fine-enilqas-933,"Everybody asks where is Eren. But nobody asks- 
How is Eren?"
samgo88,rabidjworlds,"Trust me, you don‚Äôt want to see what he‚Äôs doing. It‚Äôs absolutely fucking horrifying."
rabidjworlds,kimbolll,"I‚Äôve seen a video of guy falling off his bike only to have his head immediately run over by a bus, explode, and shoot brain juice 20 feet across the pavement‚Ä¶I think I can handle this. 

Also, no spoilies. I‚Äôm a plebeian who hasn‚Äôt read the manga."
kimbolll,TheKargato,A lot of different ways to respond but I‚Äôm sticking to a simple ‚Äúyou need better hobbies‚Äù
samgo88,virang807,"Ngl I was kinda sad we spent these last 6 episodes without eren, like I enjoyed them episodes but with everyone talking about eren, I‚Äôm like when are we gonna see the more interesting stuff with what eren‚Äôs Titan looks like when it‚Äôs moving and stufd"
samgo88,CandyyZombiezz,erehhhh
samgo88,Mafoobaloo,There will be a lot more without him lol
samgo88,TheeHighKing,"That's what pisses me off the most about this cock tease of a fucking show. It's actually worse than 90's DBZ because the manga for DBZ was still going so they used filler to not catch up so fast. This story is absolutely finished, and needs no bows to be tied up. They been fucking with us since breaking down single seasons into 2 parts and to mislead us with ""The final season"" when that's a technicality, deserves a slap in the face to mappa. I've been waiting for years to see the Founding Titan animated... not to see Gabby or Annie."
iguessithink,Wheezing_Cactus,"I really wish they just allowed the studio to take the time they needed to finish all the episodes at once instead of dragging it out like this (and paradoxically rushing out lesser quality animation in the process). I would rather wait a few years for them to get it done properly than have some episodes now, followed by a hiatus in the middle of the story's climax because they need more time."
samgo88,Zeropass,he time travelled to the future and started playing an mmo. so it's not that interesting
samgo88,00pirateforever,And his monologue. He is currently doing his best to downgrade himself.
samgo88,peter_2202,Yeah we wont be seeing much of him until like the very end
samgo88,memesfromthevine,"To be fair, the show has been about him for the past 80 episodes"
samgo88,Rigistroni,Almost like the story is focusing on the protagonists of this arc now that Eren has been set up as the villan
Rigistroni,mnimatiacfh,üíÄüíÄüíÄ LMAO do u know what protagonist means?
mnimatiacfh,Rigistroni,"It's the character of focus in a given story.  Seeing as Eren is not the character of focus in this arc he isn't the protagonist in the rumbling arc. Armin and Mikasa are.

An antagonist in a story however, is the character that is the source of the conflict the protagonist(s) fight against. Which perfectly suits the role of Eren in the story right now.

Whether or not you agree with his actions, Eren is undeniably the antagonist in the final arc of AOT. Eren is the protagonist of everything before the timeskip and afterwards is slowly shifted to the role of antagonist with Falco and Gabi being the protagonists up until we catch up with the main cast, at which point Armin and Mikasa take over the role of protagonist."
samgo88,PC_AKKU,Manga readers with their Manga-vision üòè
samgo88,wilzix12,"You will have to wait 1 year and a half for complete disappointment, i'm dropping aot after this last episode, if we don't get anything about aoe"
samgo88,jxnsjejsjdjfjf,I mean I guess they can‚Äôt just have new reports on him or that lmao
samgo88,Shroffinator,Assuming he‚Äôll be back for the movie or part3
samgo88,Hyjori,I didn‚Äôt like when eren titan was more episodes gone and then he yaegerist fight mikasa and armin and coney for more episode eren when gone (: ?
samgo88,nsurez99,My man is two busy committing genocide to appear talking to people.
samgo88,YUPitsME_RICK,in the next episode babyyyy

samgo88,GenericCancer99,get used to it
samgo88,vitaminwater247,He needs a shower first.... his hair is....
samgo88,Eobard95,Because Eren's effectively the main antagonist of this final arc and this story is protagonist-viewpoint focused and antagonists are usually only featured when their storylines directly affect them (with the exception of the Marley Arc which actually treated the Survey Corps as antagonists instead). Reiner and Bertolt vanished for half a season after their reveals and Zeke made only a handful of appearances between 2 seasons until we learned anything about him and he is the overall main antagonist of AOT.
MarvelsGrantMan136,G_I_Joe_Mansueto,"""Part 3: The even more final season: This time, it's finaler.""   


I get it but i'm annoyed as hell that they marketed this way."
G_I_Joe_Mansueto,hnxmn,Fr I've been holding off on the final season just so I can avoid waiting a week at a time for the eps and be done w the show when this is over and now it feels like it was for no reason cuz I'mma end up waiting a whole ass year anyway
hnxmn,beckisnotmyname,I got my brother started S1 EP 1 around Christmas under the impression that itd be ending about the time he gets there. Now we get to wait a year.
hnxmn,Landyra,"Same thing here! I‚Äôve been avoiding spoilers like crazy for months - it‚Äôs just as bad as it used to be with GoT - I‚Äôve had unexpected run ins with clips being played on random YouTube videos on completely different topics, the ATLA subreddit, classmates at Uni discussing it or people using stuff as memes on Twitter. I‚Äôve managed to quickly scroll by, leave the room or close tabs every time so far, but it‚Äôs been a pain in the behind and I was so glad to FINALLY watch the entire thing in April in one go with a clean slate üò≠ 

I guess I‚Äôm giving up and just watching part 2 on it‚Äôs own.. I already held of freaking SEVEN YEARS after the first season, wanting to watch everything at once and ended up failing when I couldn‚Äôt wait any longer after s4p1 had finished releasing ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
hnxmn,vulxaNN,"bro same  
I legit binged all the episodes on Sunday evening and waited for the final episode till 2:15 am"
G_I_Joe_Mansueto,Devdev007,"No way they haven't known this would be a thing for some time now. They literally just held off on announcing it to get more views on the ""Final, final season."" It's completely asinine and incredibly insulting as a fan tbh."
Devdev007,MRSUNSHINEXXXXX,"When they ment ""final"" they ment last episode of the final season part 2. Part 3 of the final season is going to be the final part of the final season but they will probably have a mid-season final part finale half way through of the final part of the final season."
Devdev007,talon1200,"I think you mean the Final, final, final season. Otherwise known as Final Season, the finale, finally"
Devdev007,JustAnArtist1221,"Keep in mind that neither the studio, nor mangaka, are in charge of announcements. It's the network. They are more than likely contractually obligated not to say anything, as is the case with most productions."
Devdev007,iPhritzy,It is kinda in classic AoT style though to do the biggest cliffhanger they can.
Devdev007,ChicanaGrimes,"Agreed. I'm still a huge fan, and will for sure watch until the end, but enough is enough.

I've been watching for YEARS and have been so vigilant about avoiding spoilers and being patient. I'm just going to give up and read the manga already. I'm tired of waiting...and waiting...and waiting...and then being fooled into waiting (for what will probably not be the last time)....just for 25 minute episodes that spend 15 minutes recapping and 10 minutes showing actual story progression/action.

It's ANIMATION. It's not like they're facing production issues as you would with live action (like with GOT that u/Landyra mentioned earlier). Of course, it still takes thousands of hours to create such a stunning anime, but this is just dragging out something awesome for money/staying relevant.

**EDIT:** Ok, I was NOT aware of all the crazy production issues the studio has faced (I tend to avoid deep dives on AOT to avoid spoilers -- thanks for all of you sharing this knowledge!) Still sad, but knowing this helps :)"
Devdev007,SeeDeez101,"its not insulting at all, just sounds like youre entitled and youre upset things didnt go your way"
G_I_Joe_Mansueto,ExtraterrestialAhole,"Agreed, what the fuck is a final season part 3?"
G_I_Joe_Mansueto,Zangetsukaiba,I expected this announcement was coming but damn am I disappointed. A ‚Äúfinal season‚Äù lasting 3 years.
G_I_Joe_Mansueto,WarsledSonarman,"I‚Äôm so tired of this too. I heard ‚Äúfinal season‚Äù and rushed back, watched every episode again, only to have a mid-season break‚Ä¶ok and then each episode to drag for ages. And now this."

Mezalyth,RykariZander,"Pirate what? The part isn't out yet. Also, you weren't pirating b4?"
Mezalyth,hellgatsu,"It's free on  Crunchyroll, pirate  what? Lol"
MarvelsGrantMan136,cbdubs12,10 years at least‚Ä¶for ‚Äúfour‚Äù seasons. I am disappoint.
MarvelsGrantMan136,Mickelrath,"I have no problem with it being split into parts. I just think it's kinda false advertising calling it ""The Final Season"" and then go on for 3 seasons"
Mickelrath,digbick_42069,The final season thing was decided before MAPPA had absolutely nothing to do with AoT right after s3p2 aired. It was more of a miscalculation about the story's pacing rather than falsi advertising
digbick_42069,NoDadNoTears,"While this is a good explanation I don't think this necessarily means that the criticism about the naming isn't still warranted.  Regardless of what happened and whether the mistake was honest or not it's still patently absurd that this has been called the ""final season"" for what will be 3 years. 

Plus it's not on fans to research why something was titled the way it was and what mistakes happened.  It's just not reasonable to expect a fanbase to dig deeper on marketing.

I also think that even despite the apparent honest mistakes, the complete radio silence on the subject is on them.  It would of been pretty easy and quick to release a statement or interview or something that would of given the general hint that Season 4 would be 3 distinct parts.  I don't see much of an excuse for that."
digbick_42069,Mickelrath,"Yeah that's why I said it feels like it. I know it's not the reality. Shit happens, I get that. It's just frustrating

Edit: I didn't say that, I meant to. Lol"
Mickelrath,ICE-FLAME_X_,"You really need to understand the difference between ""part"" and ""season""."
ICE-FLAME_X_,Penguator432,"Nah, the entertainment business as a whole just needs to give up on this ‚Äúpart 1/2/3‚Äù bs"
Mickelrath,bhavyagarg8,"Its not 3 seasons , its 3 parts. Season 4 is the final season."
Mickelrath,Background_Balance_7,Seriously I was waiting till it finished to binge it üôÉ
Mickelrath,DusanGoku,Just wait for the 4th lol
Mickelrath,laralye,Yeah this is honestly pissing me off lmao. I laughed when I saw this part 3 tomfoolery. Ugh

FrontStabb3r,MangaDub,Eren: What are you doing Linked Horizon? Don't you want to make another banger opening. This is the OP you started. Tatakae
FrontStabb3r,ICE-FLAME_X_,"Yeah, it would he fucking awesome"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Filmologic,"Can't tell if this is worse than JoJo part 6 or not. Is this like a thing now? Obviously no hate towards the people who are actually working really hard on it, especially the animators, but man it's definitely kinda annoying and kills all momentum.."
Filmologic,heartbreakhill,"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs about the same level of bullshit, for different reason

With Jojos you had the highly anticipated next part, they released the first 1/3ish of the story in a cluster so most people binged it all in one day, then waited four months to be told they have to wait six more months on top of that. And that next batch still isn‚Äôt gonna cover the rest of the story, so odds are there‚Äôs gonna be a third batch for Jojos as well.

With AoT the hype for the ‚ÄúFinal‚Äù season got viewers back to the hype the first season had, at least from my perspective. Then when Part 1 ran its course, we found out we have to wait a year for Part 2, then when we found out Part 2 **still** wasn‚Äôt gonna cover through the end, we get radio silence until they announce Part 3 is coming at *some point* next year."
heartbreakhill,Filmologic,"Yeah I agree. Even if they did this to extend the longevity of the shows lifespans, by only giving the fans a little piece at a time (possibly to create hype around the manga volumes and other merchandise in the mean time? Idk), it just feels like an insult. And I say this as someone who'd prefer seasonal One Piece instead of weekly. I'm fine waiting, absolutely, and especially with such quality products, but it's still so mind-boggling to me the way they choose to do this"
heartbreakhill,QuestioningEspecialy,"Something hit me. They're probably gonna do things with the final final final season that will cause some manga readers to rejoice and others to despair. I'm looking forward to this ride one more time. ^(sucks that we gotta wait a damn year, but whatevs)"
Filmologic,Prior_Let1477,Dont worry this will happen to part 6 too since netflix have the rights.
Filmologic,Sonicowen,"Marketing decision maybe. A lot of anime watchers  dropped off, easier to get them back if your advertising the final series though"
Filmologic,2kelhadj,i think jojo still is worse at least aot will keep its hype jojos hype died off so fast
Filmologic,Rialmwe,"I imagine it has to be better for them while doing the production. Instead of waiting several years or just getting involved in one project they prefer to divide it in several parts.

Also taking into account the system of subscription, medias like netflix, etc prefer way more to have people engaged several years that way people has something fresh if they want to continue seeing, instead of just watched everything in one month or two."
Filmologic,TruthInAnecdotes,"I don't mind waiting and I'm glad that part 3 was at least confirmed today.

The work MAPPA did with some of the animations in pt 2 were phenomenal and they need all the time to translate the final chapters of the manga into something truly epic."
Filmologic,peacefulghandi,"I think Jojo is worse. At least AOT still has weekly releases and is keeping people engaged and is simply drawing out the ending, like what lots of franchises do nowadays (Harry Potter, Marvel to a degree, Twilight), so it's not something totally unexpected or unfamiliar (though it does definitely suck). Jojo's hype was more completely and quickly killed, both with the lack of weekly releases and the several months with no word on a second batch. Part 6 isn't the end of Jojo and yet its release has been getting dragged out a ton."
Filmologic,starbitcandies,"I got maybe halfway through part two and just lost interest esp since I've read the manga. I'll pick it back up again when part 3 comes out for sure but for now, I just don't care to watch it even further spread out. I can barely handle a week at a time."
MarvelsGrantMan136,WhitePeopleAreFunny,Fk this im reading the manga
WhitePeopleAreFunny,-Champloo-,"I recommend just dropping the series instead.

The end of AoT is all time bad. It's worse than HBO's GoT."
-Champloo-,Sanuzi,As someone who started the show a week ago and finished the manga today. I disagree
WhitePeopleAreFunny,Rexamidalion,Don't
Rexamidalion,lem_on-,Can i know why(‡≤°‚Ä∏‡≤°)
Rexamidalion,mattex818,"I did last week and I don't regret it at all! Do it people, you won't be disappointed"

WhitePeopleAreFunny,Barjuden,"I literally bought the first box set a month ago when I figured this was gonna happen. I have the first 12 volumes now, but shit is expensive."
WhitePeopleAreFunny,owoah323,That was me after the end of season 3 lol
WhitePeopleAreFunny,NightShiftNurses,You only have a few chapters do go anyways for closure
Pardusco,Frencich,"The beauty of aot for me has always been to make theories, season after season. If I had started watching it now I would have seen like 5 episodes a day and I would have ruined the best part of it."
Pardusco,zenojones,"So this was my thinking of one piece and now look at me 981 eps in... still haven't started... have 350+ ""Slow"" ""filler"" eps.. now I don't even want to watch it lol"
Pardusco,ItalianStallion9069,Same though i love AoT
Last_Lone_Wolf,DoughtyAndCarterLLP,"People are upvoting this but if they had to wait 3 years, the hype would be dead and people would be comparing it to Game of Thrones books.

What they screwed up was calling it the final season."
Last_Lone_Wolf,cidalkimos,But Y‚Äôall complained with the 4 year wait till season 2‚Ä¶
ViSimpp,Wiimmoz,Lmao but then you'll have to wait longer and by then Part3 would've finished xD
ViSimpp,cjdualima,"Noo if it's a movie it'll have all the merch, toys, promos, etc EVERYWHERE and it will 100% be spoilers for the ending"
ViSimpp,heartbreakhill,"Could be worse, look at what‚Äôs happening with Jojo Part 6"
skippyalpha,Sonicowen,"Isn't it tidier to split the series into 2 halves? 

Pre-Time Skip - Season 1, 2, and 3

Post-Time Skip - Season 4, 5, and 6

Makes a lot more sense to me than what they did end up going with."
JakeCMMA,rfquiaios,Whats frustrating to me isn‚Äôt the time we have to wait for another season. It‚Äôs them calling it the final season for years. It is killing the hype for me tbh.
derik-for-real,digbick_42069,How the fuck is it lazy when they're taking the time to adapt literally every single detail from the source material?? Lazy is what you would call the 2nd season of The Promised Neverland.
derik-for-real,InsertUsernameHere32,"To be fair to MAPPA they‚Äôve been juggling this along with Jujutsu Kaisen S1, Jujutsu Kaisen 0, and Jujutsu Kaisen S2. It‚Äôs not just possible for them right now to release all of them so fast"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Binladinsuncle,"I wish they had just laid out a roadmap or something. Instead we get this bullshit teasing. Final Season! Just kidding, Final Season Part Two! Oh you though that was it? Final Season Part Three!!!! Like, god damn, I hope I don‚Äôt die before this show ends. Maybe I‚Äôll spare myself of this impending doom feeling and just finish the manga"
Binladinsuncle,CombatEternal_,I'm just choosing to believe they end it with a movie now so I'm not traumatized when it actually happens.
MarvelsGrantMan136,The_Hammer_Jonathan,How frustrating
The_Hammer_Jonathan,ICE-FLAME_X_,"Bro, even if it was a movie you would still wait."
ICE-FLAME_X_,Jakeyloransen,"People probably wouldn't have been this mad if it was a movie, but now they gotta wait for a season to come out and all of its episodes weekly too."
The_Hammer_Jonathan,VRisNOTdead,Yeah I‚Äôm a bit bummed.
MarvelsGrantMan136,mnmkdc,"Literally comical at this point. Just call it season 7. Calling something ""the final season"" and then having 2 more seasons following is just clickbait"
mnmkdc,ohfaith,this is exhausting lol
mnmkdc,rkratha,They just trynna milk it as much as possible.
rkratha,DanielCampos411,Explain to me how they‚Äôre milking a show that is just following the manga source exactly how it was written
mnmkdc,bhavyagarg8,I don't get your point. They never said that we will have 2 more seasons. Season 4 is final. There isn't enough story to make it to season 5 and season 6 anyway.
mnmkdc,SeeDeez101,"you all love the show and are addicted to aot and love and support the writers and creators blah blah blah but the second something doesnt go your way, youre immediately on the hate bandwagon. 

anime fans gotta be the worst fans in the world..."
SeeDeez101,mnmkdc,"Not me. I‚Äôve been saying this since midway through season 4 p1 when it was clear they weren‚Äôt finishing it.

And idk what kinda complex you have when you think you‚Äôre not allowed to criticize something you like, but you can and you should."
mnmkdc,rudyv8,The final season consists of half the total episodes?  Fucking christ.
MarvelsGrantMan136,PlumbTuckered767,"I'm so over this shit. I'm going to watch the episode tonight, then I'm going to read the remaining manga. Can one of you kind folks confirm, once the episode is over, where I should start in order to read the rest?

Edit: Thanks to everyone! I started on chapter 130 (bought a digital copy on Comixology on Amazon (they just acquired them)) and just finished. It was absolutely the right decision for me. I'm going to be thinking about this story for a long, long time."
PlumbTuckered767,Chungulungus,Start at chapter 130
Chungulungus,cortana86,"I would even say start at 123 (or 122 to figure out what point you're caught up to) because they skipped chapter 123 in the show. It's a brief flashback chapter but important I think.

Edit: People are saying 123 is in today's episode. So maybe ignore this? Maybe not haha. I have yet to see it.

Edit 2: Do what the person above said. 130 and you're good to go. I was incorrect before. :)"
PlumbTuckered767,D_Ratrick_T,Yeppppp I did this last year lol
PlumbTuckered767,thedickkicker,Thank the lord I read the manga cause I wouldn't have kept in the urge to wait for 2 fucking years. This part was high on momentum as well because of the ending and stuff like that but ig it is what it is
thedickkicker,PlumbTuckered767,"I am already done with Trade #33, starting #34 now. I would not have been able to stand them splitting this up into 20 minutes of content with 7 minutes of songs and credits. I would have lost my mind even more. So glad I made this call. Wish I had done it earlier."
PlumbTuckered767,TheLegend360_v2,Same man
PlumbTuckered767,thisonesforharambe,"Sorry I‚Äôm new to anime, is there somewhere you would typically go to read the Manga?"
PlumbTuckered767,Breakfast_Bacon,Yeah I‚Äôve been anime only too but it‚Äôs manga time for me as well.
PlumbTuckered767,Ok_Potato_5272,"Can anyone tell me where I can read them online? I don't mind if it's paid, i just don't want to buy physical copies"
Ok_Potato_5272,PlumbTuckered767,Comixology.
PlumbTuckered767,12dootdoot1212,Read it fast in a fast pace. I read it in a fast space and i dont remember much lol. I started reading it after the 11th ep was released
PlumbTuckered767,Zebaktu,"You must have recently started watching because nobody who has been waiting 8-9 years should give up now‚Ä¶ it would just be pathetic. 

If you started watching AoT recently then I can understand this child-like patience but yea I don‚Äôt understand it if you‚Äôve been anime only and have have survived the multiple year waits already."
Zebaktu,KirinoMyWaifu,"Been watching since 2013, and I read the manga after tonight‚Äôs episode. They‚Äôre milking the ‚Äòfinal season‚Äô hype, and I‚Äôm not waiting a year for 7 chapters to be adapted, which I‚Äôm likely to be spoiled for.

And stop gatekeeping lmao"

MarvelsGrantMan136,UNSKIALz,"In theory - Assuming someone hasn't read the manga - How do they know there won't be a Part 4? Or 5? Announcing it right as people expect an ending is annoying.

Season 4 clearly wasn't the ""Final Season"" - There's Season 4, 5 and 6."
UNSKIALz,_INCompl_,"The manga was still coming out with pages so they probably just vastly underestimated how much was left. Going into the last couple episodes it became pretty obvious that there‚Äôd have to be more show unless they wanted to try to condense several chapters into a single 25 minute episode. Unless more gets added onto the ending for some stupid reason, this should be the last extension of season 4."
UNSKIALz,Zaclarke,"Yeah‚Ä¶I‚Äôm confused about why they lied 

I would have watch it anyway"
Zaclarke,Basblob,I think it had less to do with lying and more to do with planning and scheduling.

KidFlash383,Alt1119991,It looks ridiculous lol
MarvelsGrantMan136,MorganKIng14,They are milking the absolute shit out of this
MorganKIng14,PocoLocoOP,The story feels natural imo. They need one more part to conclude the story without rushing through the story. There is a lot that has to be told. They aren't just extending the series just for the sake of being longer.
MorganKIng14,mpares016,Like one piece for decades
mpares016,atypicalphilosopher,"Nah, One Piece aint a great comparison.

The One Piece anime? Sure. They decided to do it at a snails pace instead of add any filler plot / story.

But the One Piece manga has pretty much never stopped being good, well paced, etc."
MorganKIng14,digbick_42069,How the fuck is it milking when they're literally only adapting the source material??
digbick_42069,mnmkdc,By calling 3 seasons the final season to garner hype. Can‚Äôt wait for Aot the final season the final part
digbick_42069,FrostyD7,"If they just told people this when they made the decision, nobody would really care.  They dug their own graves waiting this long, they chose to be sleazy, nobody forced them."

  Stringing fans along for literally a year plus about when things are coming out while still marketing it as ""this is IT guys, you CANT miss this"" feels so scummy"

I have not been enjoying these last 6 eps as much as the amazing start to part 2, and if the ending is going to be as disappointing as people say and we have to wait another year for it‚Ä¶ whats the point of waiting?

Looks like Steins; Gate is remaining #1

EDIT: Just finished it. They ALMOST stuck the landing perfectly. ALMOST. The ideas were there and were executed around 80% to perfection. Some wonky choices were made, and I would have liked a little bit more closure for some stuff, but I‚Äôm satisfied with the ending. With this ending it just barely misses out on being #1 but if they clean up some key things it might end up #1 when the anime is done"
L_sigh_kangeroo,CaptainMaxCrunch,Do it. I did and I'm so glad I didn't wait for it. The ending was so weird and rushed it dropped AoT from my favorite anime to not even top 10.
L_sigh_kangeroo,ICE-FLAME_X_,Finally someone who doesn't think that the ending is worst than the Holocaust.
ICE-FLAME_X_,L_sigh_kangeroo,"People calling it GoT S8 level are being dramatic. The ideas made perfect sense thematically and narratively, it was just the execution that fell short.

GoT literally mindlessly undid years of careful/intricate buildup"
L_sigh_kangeroo,tlnner,code Geass is always gonna be #1

L_sigh_kangeroo,lionesslizzy,Glad you read it and formed your own opinion! I'm excited to see the end animated eventually because I feel like they will be able to execute the things that felt rushed a bit better.
L_sigh_kangeroo,laralye,Yeah I really hope they don't squander this whole season 4.3 and fill in all the gaps the manga was missing...

MarvelsGrantMan136,emailo1,"""the final season this time actually the final for real i swear"""
MarvelsGrantMan136,heartbreakhill,THE ABSOLUTE MADMEN ACTUALLY DID IT
MarvelsGrantMan136,AnastasiaDaren,"Some people around here are a bit nuts, it seems. I haven't read the ending, so I can't speak for what is to come, but all of S4 has been peak television. Easily one of the best TV shows I have ever seen, by far the best anime I've seen thus far, and I have seen a lot of tv."
AnastasiaDaren,SillyLilHobbit,A lot of aot fans are pretty nuts lol. Should've been clear when the Manga readers were so damn intent on spoiling the anime veiwers all the time.
AnastasiaDaren,sawinnz,"It‚Äôs not that, and yes the season has been a masterpiece. It‚Äôs just the fact that this is marketed as the final season, yet they might as well have called it Season 6."
MarvelsGrantMan136,I_TittyFuck_Doves,What a fucking joke
MarvelsGrantMan136,ahmadtheanon,AoT...Final Season...Part 3....the end.....of the end...for the beginning....of the beginning......

MarvelsGrantMan136,user1joja,How is Levi gonna work his gear properly if he has two missing fingers ?
user1joja,PatentedPotato,The other 2 fingers
user1joja,Unlucky_Junket_3639,The gear only has two buttons and one joystick. He‚Äôs got enough.
Unlucky_Junket_3639,user1joja,"It has an index and middle finger trigger, both of which he‚Äôs missing,he would have to hold the sword in a very finicky way in order to properly use gear, I haven‚Äôt read the manga but it seems like he may not be as effective as usual"

MarvelsGrantMan136,nickintheback08,"As a game of thrones fan, I prefer this so much more than rushing the ending.  I‚Äôm totally fine with waiting longer."

MarvelsGrantMan136,Desch92,"I just ended up reading the manga, can't wait a whole another year."
MarvelsGrantMan136,DjijiMayCry,Not watching until after the finale next year. They deserve low ratings for this tbh
DjijiMayCry,Crafty-Bunch-2675,"Exactly !
Like I mean come on. I don't read the manga but I know just by the global stakes of the Rumbling that the entire show must be nearing its end...and for them to pull this filler fluff again just to maximize profits ?
That's  a slap to the dedicated fans."
MarvelsGrantMan136,No_Builder_3144,final final season aaaaaaa
MarvelsGrantMan136,Monev91,"Glad I read it already lol, over these guys honey dicking this final season, moved on already."

MarvelsGrantMan136,whoreforcheese,"I literally laughed out loud, what a fucking joke. Im so frustrated with the pacing it doesnt make me want to wait to watch it. Im glad I finished reading it already."
MarvelsGrantMan136,SecondRealitySims,"Ignoring the fact the ‚Äòfinal season‚Äô has essentially just three stuffed into one, how do they plan on making a whole new part out of it? Aren‚Äôt there only a few chapters left? Paired with there most likely being action sequences, I don‚Äôt see how they can make another complete part."
MarvelsGrantMan136,TheJimDim,When you're accurate to the manga but you got the pacing all wrong
MarvelsGrantMan136,OctaviusMaximus_,Maybe the ending will differ from the manga a bit?
MarvelsGrantMan136,norwegianmorningw00d,Milking the shit out of attack on Titan
MarvelsGrantMan136,Xdmemer14,So lame.
MarvelsGrantMan136,ZellNorth,Bullshit. The final ‚Äúseason‚Äù is in three parts over 3 years. It‚Äôs just three fucking seasons. Fuckin hell
MarvelsGrantMan136,Williamlee3171,Wow they are really milking this show
MarvelsGrantMan136,norwegianmorningw00d,So we gonna wait a year for the ass ending
MarvelsGrantMan136,explosivecurry13,the  only good thing to take away from this  is we have another opening  to dwell over
MarvelsGrantMan136,Jerrybeshara,"Lol. I haven‚Äôt watched any of part two, was waiting for them all to drop so I could just get it over with on my day off. Fucking wow. Guess I‚Äôm just gonna blow my brains out. This is the last thing I needed"
MarvelsGrantMan136,andrewwhen,in an alternate reality it would‚Äôve been a lot cooler if it was a movie instead
MarvelsGrantMan136,fist_my_muff2,Guess I'm alone in being pumped for it. Sadge.
MarvelsGrantMan136,LeoBocchi,"Honestly I can‚Äôt take my head off that they should have made the finale a movie, there‚Äôs enough chapters to fill a 2 and a half hour runtime, the animation quality would‚Äôve been insane, and the hype towards would be probably the biggest any anime ever has gotten since mugen train. Making a part 3 just kills the momentum, I mean part 2 already doesn‚Äôt have the same hype part 1 had, I remember literally everyone was watching Attack on Titan last year, trending Twitter weekly, and all that, now it seems a lot less traffic going around on the show, and it‚Äôs not because of the quality, I honestly think part 2 is the best season of the show, but it doesn‚Äôt have the hype. Watching the finale of the my favorite tv show ever with my friends and a crowd of fans on a movie theater would‚Äôve been really cool.

Edit: looking at the bright side, we‚Äôll get a new OP! And please be linked horizon."
MarvelsGrantMan136,forbhip,"I guess I‚Äôve got no choice but to read the manga now, there‚Äôs no way I expect to avoid spoilers for that long.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been said elsewhere but does anyone know what chapter we are at now so I can start from there?

EDIT: ignore this I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs best to go from chapter 130"
forbhip,ImLosing_my_mind,"Yeah it‚Äôs been really hard for me to avoid spoilers just this year, I can‚Äôt imagine another year. I have been spoiled, because someone on yt wanted to ruin my whole day and replied a spoiler to me comment. But I really wanted to watch the anime first and then read the manga at a later time, but I might have to reconsider that now."
MarvelsGrantMan136,Winners_84,"So will this be AOT, the final season, the final part?

Love the series but all good things must come to an end."
MarvelsGrantMan136,iamal3x_,Anyone else wish they'd have made a movie to end it
MarvelsGrantMan136,J-I-Z-Z,ANOTHER PART???
MarvelsGrantMan136,Duke_Rebby,"It's okay guys, this is really the final final final season, i promise."
MarvelsGrantMan136,JasonTParker,"Just call it season 5.... I get it you announced the ""final season"" before you knew how many chapters were left. But this is just getting silly."
MarvelsGrantMan136,Tetxis,"Should of delayed part 2 by a year and released the whole thing

Only good news is that we get a new intro"
MarvelsGrantMan136,ClawbberingTime,The pacing of the last half of part 2 has been horrendous imo and incredibly disingenuous to make a last season announcement essentially 3 seasons.
MarvelsGrantMan136,Turboswag420,"This is such an L

Should‚Äôve been a movie"
MarvelsGrantMan136,TripKnot,"aaaaaaaaand I've suddenly lost all interest in watching this anymore.  Pacing has sucked for a couple years now, I can't follow the huge number of characters and their ever changing associations, and the storytelling is just lazy and boring.  9 years for 4 ""seasons"" and the final season spanning 2020-2023+.  It's a fucking joke, I'm done."
MarvelsGrantMan136,cloudyboi3352,I wanna see admin throw hands with a put colossal
MarvelsGrantMan136,Unkechaug,"It‚Äôs really annoying that it‚Äôs being handled and marketed this way. Part 3? How about Attack on Titan: The Final Season: The Final Part. Can we just get a commitment that it will conclude the story? How fucking difficult is that? This isn‚Äôt something they won‚Äôt know far ahead of time, and letting the final episode drop without a word of this is just shitty. 


With that said, I am excited that we are getting more - enough to be another season. With the way Isayama mentioned he wanted to improve the way he conveyed the ending, this might be a really good opportunity to give additional time and scenes to arrive at the end. I am willing to be patient if they can give the show the love and dedication they have in its entirety so far. I think it has the potential to go down as the greatest of all time, and it just needs to stick the landing - take the time you need, my complaints about the messaging are completely separate to the quality of the show. Just the business of it."
MarvelsGrantMan136,StoopidDingus69,Levi with the sword drawn let‚Äôs go
MarvelsGrantMan136,TrickyTalon,Armin‚Äôs the new main character! Joy!
MarvelsGrantMan136,Microtic,LOL! It looks like they just copy / pasted them into the footprint from the last episode of final season part 2!
MarvelsGrantMan136,Ryluchs,Getting people invested in the Show for 10 years and than having the finale delayed is a goodway to sell some more mangas
MarvelsGrantMan136,Itlu_PeeP,"Well, that's just fucked up marketing"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Zealousideal-Cat-194,"Do I hate the way they went about this, absolutely.

Should each part of the season have been around 20 episodes long, maybe.

But you guys are missing the silver lining, NEW OP and ED!!"
MarvelsGrantMan136,FuriousKale,Expected. Which is why I haven't even started watching the second part yet. At least I read the manga so the anticipation won't kill me.
MarvelsGrantMan136,Chrispix94,"Love how mappa does this to us, and doesn't increase the quality of the episodes. There's still 3D titans, you're telling me you can't even rotoscope during that time it really just confirms that they're putting this on the back burner because Jujutsu and demon slayer sell more. Sick of it."
MarvelsGrantMan136,paranoidzoid1,"The year is 2028 and part 6 of AoT final season is released, everyone wonders if this is it. The final scenes are playing out. Looks like this could be it. The epic conclusion to the series ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.


‚Ä¶‚Ä¶cliffhanger, to be continued appears. AoT final season part seven is announced. We all wait to watch anyway"
MarvelsGrantMan136,tazerface1994,"Finally sat down with some popcorn beer and joints and stayed up all night to watch finale part 2.. I was so excited, really thought this was the last one :("
MarvelsGrantMan136,TBCat,The final season: the final part
MarvelsGrantMan136,zaplinaki,Ok. This is bullshit.
MarvelsGrantMan136,Oversama,"Judging by the character placement, it seems Armin is now the protagonist."
MarvelsGrantMan136,BrownPerv15,Been the final season for a while now huh
MarvelsGrantMan136,BankutiCutie,"Ohh this makes sense‚Ä¶. So when they said final season they meant they could just break up the final season into 3 parts and spread it over 3 different calendar years i get it

I ended up getting so pissed that this weeks episode was still filler that i unenrolled from Funimation and proceeded to rage read the last 10 or so chapters of the manga out of pure frustration"
MarvelsGrantMan136,mas-sive,"Lol what a joke, going to read the manga again."
MarvelsGrantMan136,scarredswordheart,"They really must draw this thing out, mustn't they?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Tremaparagon,"[Months ago I sent this to my friends as a joke about AoT, guess it was a bit accurate.](https://youtu.be/_zgb8N-5py0)"

MarvelsGrantMan136,Kheenamooth,"They should have waited a year or two, had WIT create the perfect final season for us. This is just low now."
MarvelsGrantMan136,ItzBooty,"They look badly CGI there

Its kinda funny"
MarvelsGrantMan136,benavivhorn,"Fuck it, fuck mappa executives, why the fuck did somebody think this was a good idea?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,GrimWolf216,I wonder why it‚Äôs going to take until 2023.
GrimWolf216,norwegianmorningw00d,Because I like money
MarvelsGrantMan136,Novel_Player,They‚Äôre taking a page out of The Walking Dead I see‚Ä¶
MarvelsGrantMan136,Umbraacadameycan,"This delay is unacceptable for the fans. I get that it takes a lot of work to make each season, and quality shouldn‚Äôt be rushed too much. However, the last chapter of the manga was written about a year ago so having to wait another 8-12 months for more content is inefficient."
MarvelsGrantMan136,The_Crypter,"Holy Shit, As an Anime only watcher, I have no clue why people are so mad about this.

Like if they had wrapped it in one episode, people would have been like 'omg, rushed omg', if they had announced a movie, people would have whined 'omg, how can they warp things up in 2 hours'.

Them announcing another season is perfect for the anime, but people are now angry that they have to wait ? Like is this sub filled with 15 year olds year with no concept of how things work ?

When MAPPA started working on Season 4, back in 2019, Manga hadn't ended, they probably discussed with everyone and decided that Final season should be more than enough to wrap things up, and It changed as time went along, I am glad that along the way they elongated it even if it meant some kids would be whining about 'oMg tHe wAiT' instead of rushing it.

There is really no winning here, the toxicity here is so sad and pathetic. This sub is gonna be a shithole during the wait with people whining about how this is a lot and they are gonna go read the manga, like Jesus, just go do that, imma outta here for a year, cya folks."
The_Crypter,spacewarp2,The problem is that this is the third time that it is the final season. They absolutely had to have known from the start of part 1 that they didn‚Äôt have enough episodes to cover all of the content. They most certainly should have known by the start of part 2. Could have just waited longer for part 2 for all of it to be finished.
MarvelsGrantMan136,deadliestpanda,"This some ole bullshit. I‚Äôm so done with this show lol imma fight whoever said ‚Äúhey, put ‚Äòfinal season‚Äô into the every season until 2025‚Äù I was prepared for it to be over. I waited weeks so I could binge it, Now this BS AGAIN!! Also, I might actually just pick up the manga out of spite. Is the manga done yet? I‚Äôm over it. Just stop releasing anything until the shit is going to be done, done. Lol this show pisses me off so much but in a good way but this particular way with the un-last-season seasons is too much and makes me wanna kick somebody in the teeth."
YouAreInAComaWakeUp,fuckenshreddit,How is it nosediving? This season has been insane
YouAreInAComaWakeUp,J_T_L_,"I agree that this part 3 thing is absolute bullshit, but how is this show a nosedive? Especially this last season, it's been a banger pretty much every episode"
Pokefighterlp,norwegianmorningw00d,"Funny thing is part 3 will probably have like 6 episodes lol

So basically wait until winter or spring 2023 for like 6 episodes"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Everan_Shepard,Of course now you want rushed seasons
MarvelsGrantMan136,lunchbag-mermaid,Thing is we‚Äôll have to wait until 2023 but then wait EVERY WEEK again for an episode aka like another 3 months for it to actually finish. Wish it was just a movie all in one.
MarvelsGrantMan136,Pokefighterlp,Do you think this means we‚Äôll get a new opening?
MarvelsGrantMan136,TOM-EEG,This is dumb af. Hope this isn‚Äôt a precedent cause fuck this dumb shit
MarvelsGrantMan136,dogknight23,"MAPPA called it the final season after s3 p2 aired, so it isnt really false advertising, they just miscalculated."

MarvelsGrantMan136,kamixnari,"Are they freaking serious? Such a bait at this point, it‚Äôs ridiculous!! I‚Äôm so glad I said ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù and read the remainder of the manga after part 1 of the ‚ÄúFiNaL SeAsOn‚Äù =_="
MarvelsGrantMan136,Visualize_,"ThE fInAl SeAsOn

MarvelsGrantMan136,Senior_Audience_7722,They shouldn‚Äôt have done this
MarvelsGrantMan136,Gold-Knowledge5691,"Yeah, i'm not waiting another year... Which chapter of the manga do i have to go to?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,YouAreInAComaWakeUp,"Honestly I'm just done with this show. I would have rather the show ended before the time skip than have to deal with this last season any longer. 

This season is hot garbage sprinkled with gold flakes. Not worth caring about anymore"
MarvelsGrantMan136,kneus69,"Actual trash how they are doing to show. Shit tier animation, horrible story telling by either jumping all over the place with flashbacks or staying in 1 conversation for an entire episode where nothing actually happens and just baiting the fuck out of the fans. What a fucking dumpster fire."
MarvelsGrantMan136,joesphisbestjojo,"Shoulda made Season 4 Part 1 into Season 4, and Season 4 part 2 & 3 into just Season 5"
MarvelsGrantMan136,mrsmilestophat,"so so so so so disappointing. Im really getting annoyed of them splitting up these seasons like this and calling each one ""the final season"". We've been waiting for years for this conclusion, and now we have to wait ANOTHER year just for it to start? Is that even going to be the finale, or are we gong for a conclusion arc part 2 and 3? absolute BRUH moment, im reading the manga for sure now"
MarvelsGrantMan136,biologicz,"Okay like what the fuck, why false advertise? I don't know any other show that says ""Final Season"" and then drags it out for 3 years. NGL it's making me lose interest, I would have been more hype if it was just attack on titan season 4. Ridiculous, honestly."
MarvelsGrantMan136,pmoney10,"I‚Äôm just so sad‚Ä¶. Why you guys keep doing this to us fans? We loved you so much throughout all the delays and struggles. Why not let us know ahead of time this was the plan? We understand struggle, the lack of resources and the fear of losing your job. The pandemic was here for us as well. We would understand if you laid the plan down to us. ‚ÄúHey guys this is the only way to make this work, I hope you understand.‚Äù 

gawd dammit

Now you make us look like fools with a final 3 year season. The fanbase is livid, and now you make us wait another freaking year for 8-10 episodes. 

I‚Äôm so sad that I would rather dive into one piece from the beginning and try to catch up that watch this ‚Äúfinal season ep‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm just really sad and frustrated."
MarvelsGrantMan136,Appropriate_Type6153,"This is complete BS, it‚Äôs so obvious that MAPPA only cares about the money and views and is dragging the show out for so long to exploit the audience‚Äôs love and build hype. There was absolutely no reason to do a third, 9 episode part a year later. I feel like they‚Äôre completely disrespecting the fans."
MarvelsGrantMan136,Forti87,"It's still going on?

Is final season some kind of inside joke I just don't understand?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,carljeminininja,"Unpopular opinion but I'm so relieved. I hate when things end so much, I genuinely prefer things to be dragged out.  Also that means we get another opening and closing song? Fuck yeah."
MarvelsGrantMan136,Masterelia,AOE HERE WE GO
MarvelsGrantMan136,aizen3627,The rumbling ended right? So what's left also what wil they show in final part.
MarvelsGrantMan136,baby-wall-e,Yippieeee!!!
MarvelsGrantMan136,gitscr,Now I am wondering why Wit studio did not agree to this. This seems like plenty of time now
gitscr,caretaeking,"Literally the initial excuse for the show not being continued by WIT was the time needed to animate and after season 3, it would‚Äôve taken them 2/3 years to animate season 4 so we should be glad Mappa agreed to finish the show for us. Everyone kept saying that and now I‚Äôm just confused because if WIT had done it, chances are it would‚Äôve been done in 2023 just like Mappa...definitely enough time for them"

welp looks like I‚Äôll be going to barns and noble soon"
MarvelsGrantMan136,clique34,Bruh isn‚Äôt the whole point of releasing last season in 2021 was to be able to build hype? I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt bitch about it too much. I just want to see the ending. It‚Äôll forever be my favorite anime.
MarvelsGrantMan136,Logical-Patience-397,"Kinda sad it's not a movie. I suppose this is better than rushing it, but we'll have to wait months before the end, whereas a movie's all at once, and at least justifies the late announcement."
MarvelsGrantMan136,Uuncledrew,"by delaying it could have a negative impact as people are already frustrated with waiting and now we have to wait even longer. At this point I gave up, I‚Äôm just going to read the manga. I need closure."

MarvelsGrantMan136,jofr4,"Mark my words, we will have a part 4‚Ä¶ Add some fillers in part 3 and here we go .."
MarvelsGrantMan136,KarmelCHAOS,Does it really count as the final season if the final season is actually three seasons over the course of 3-4 years?
MarvelsGrantMan136,spamleht,"this is mostly why i haven‚Äôt started watching s4 part 2 yet. personally, having to wait for episodes on a weekly basis, let alone for a year, kills my
excitement. when part 3 comes out, i‚Äôll make a day out of it and watch the rest of season 4 all at once. 

i don‚Äôt blame mappa for this or anything - they‚Äôre already so overworked. however, i won‚Äôt say i‚Äôm pleased about how long it‚Äôs taken AOT to finish airing. i probably jumped to a few conclusions, but i got a big ‚Äúit all ends here‚Äù feeling from the s4p2 teasers."

MarvelsGrantMan136,r3dphoenix,"Can't wait to watch ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 99"""
MarvelsGrantMan136,bongowasd,With my *FINAL* breath I'll..... Live out my life normally for a number of years lol. Why on earth was it done this way?
MarvelsGrantMan136,Lightning1999,I wonder how many people were expecting a conclusion to the story in today‚Äôs episode
MarvelsGrantMan136,United-Student-1607,It‚Äôs not ok to drag it out like this.  Not ok.
MarvelsGrantMan136,Kidtendo,"Wonder why they even bother calling it the final season in the first place lol. Even though the Walking Dead had mid-season finales, it was nothing like this!"
MarvelsGrantMan136,meexley2,This is horseshit.
MarvelsGrantMan136,tyelr19,Having to wait a minimum of 8 months is excruciatingly aggravating
MarvelsGrantMan136,KarmelCHAOS,"So, with the way it's been adapted so far...are we expecting like a half cour of like 6-8 episodes to finish off the series?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Zealousideal_War_483,The ‚Äúfinal season‚Äù started Winter 2020‚Ä¶.. let that sink in
MarvelsGrantMan136,Panda117-,2023? T_T
MarvelsGrantMan136,DutchDweeb,"I just want some clarification bc i'm confused, I read that thr final episodes are coming in apr, and also read that a final season is coming next year?
I literally got Crunchyroll yesterday because I finally want to watch the show in al its completeness, but I feel really lost in the woods atm, and am not sure whether to start watching now or next year.."
MarvelsGrantMan136,bluemoney21,"So we have:

1. AOT: The Final Season
2. AOT: The Finaler Season
3. AOT: The Finalest Season"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Klonditebar,"Ok I gotta ask, is the manga done? I‚Äôve been choosing not to read it since I thought this would be the end but now i guess if the manga is complete I would just read that instead of waiting a year."
Klonditebar,faceless_coloradian,It's been done for a year or two now
MarvelsGrantMan136,zdar2,I mean I‚Äôm kinda happy we get another season worth of episodes instead of it being all over today
MarvelsGrantMan136,Bahmawama,Was this the last episode until the next part?
MarvelsGrantMan136,Whit3boy316,This is so fucking stupid
MarvelsGrantMan136,finePolyethylene,I‚Äôm old enough to remember people saying that the anime and manga will end at the same time
MarvelsGrantMan136,DusanGoku,They're dragging it so much.. really don't wanna watch it anymore.. call me when it's all done. I read everything anyway
MarvelsGrantMan136,slingshot91,"I would/will happily keep watching this show as long as they produce episodes. However, the expectation based on them calling it The Final Season is that it will reach the conclusion by the end of the episodes. Even if they said at the the start that the final season will be broken into three batches of episodes released a year apart, I would get it. But why I am finding out the day of the ‚Äúfinale‚Äù of the final season that, ‚ÄúWAIT! it‚Äôs not the finale‚Äù? It‚Äôs really absurd, and it‚Äôs a problem they made for what benefit?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,ZeShapyra,"We seriously gonna wait a year huh.

Damn"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Late_Half_818,loool
MarvelsGrantMan136,thatswhyIleft,jfc already. Gonna milk this shit for years. Not gonna watch part 3 until I know for goddamn sure if it's the last part or if part 4 is on its way.
MarvelsGrantMan136,javionichan,What the actual fuck?? I had not seen the last 4 episodes because I was waiting for the rest to come up so I can saw them in one session with the finale.. What is this bullshit?
MarvelsGrantMan136,Shew0lf119,I‚Äôm pissed off -.-
MarvelsGrantMan136,SaintYoungMan,"Rather than a final season they should make a MOVIE as a series ending that would be epic to watch it in theatres, also there's not much left to show number of episodes will be less.."
MarvelsGrantMan136,FrankDoesDoodles,FUCK!
MarvelsGrantMan136,Zero_2146,"I know everyone mad as hell lmfao, I just went ahead and read it all, I only wanted to watch The Rumbling through the anime, other than that, I don‚Äôt care to see it"
MarvelsGrantMan136,amb_027,Final season part 4 part 2 >>
MarvelsGrantMan136,YUPitsME_RICK,i mean mappa had a lot on them this year along with jjk0
MarvelsGrantMan136,Majin_Romulus,Worthless assholes. Story is nearly over just finish it already.
MarvelsGrantMan136,ThiccMashmallow,I thought the anime finished it- I guess not
MarvelsGrantMan136,WaiyakiProffessor,I feel cheated
MarvelsGrantMan136,House-Of-Black-07,So does this mean new opening and ending? Idk the ones we got for part 2 felt pretty ‚Äúfinal‚Äù
MarvelsGrantMan136,Shiloh_Moon,Actually not mad but I can see why it would be frustrating for ppl thinking it‚Äôs the last one. But as a big fan of the anime I can‚Äôt complain that we have more content to enjoy hehe
MarvelsGrantMan136,Ok_Potato_5272,"I've actually been rage watching the last few episodes, especially the filler. The last episode was objectively good but I am so pissed that I have to wait another year that I didn't enjoy it at all."
MarvelsGrantMan136,YoYoWithJosh,"It annoys me more than it should that they‚Äôre going with ‚ÄúAttack on Titan the Final Season: Part (1-3)‚Äù instead of just making it season 4, season 5, and then The Final Season. I‚Äôm not sure the marketing team knows what final means"
MarvelsGrantMan136,roee3x,"I can't wait for
Attack on titan: The final season part 4
Attack on titan: The final season days of future past
Attack on titan: The final season chain of memory

MarvelsGrantMan136,Wisemonkey07,Wasn't this supposed to be the last season? ü§î I am confused
MarvelsGrantMan136,SE4NLN415,"Yeah, I'm not waiting for it"
MarvelsGrantMan136,enough0729,3 is not the final
MarvelsGrantMan136,BDNjunior,Id rather have another season than movie. It‚Äôll feel nice to have a whole seriew together on the end for a rewatch.
MarvelsGrantMan136,gEiStToG,AoT Final Season Part 12: Erens Grand Kids inherit the Titans.
MarvelsGrantMan136,DOctorEArl,in retrospect it didn't make sense that this episode would be the last. As a manga reader I was trying to figure out how they could possibly cram the rest of the show in one episode. There is still a lot of story to be told.
MarvelsGrantMan136,aspiring_dev1,That is a long wait sighhh guess this is the final final part lol
MarvelsGrantMan136,TheDrunkNun,"I‚Äôm so lost, was it known that it was going to be 3 parts? I was expecting this to be the last episode. Is part 3 going to be the end?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,zayedsoudagar,"Is it just me that feels like giving in and reading the manga now that the rest of the episodes are coming next year? I was so excited to see the end and was expecting this last episode to be a movie that would conclude it all.  


Do you think they've delayed the rest of the episodes coz MAPPA are overworked af rn üòÇ? Big shout out to them though, they did an insane job with part 2 üëè."
MarvelsGrantMan136,FunnyDifficulty6,Attack on titan final final season part 18. Soon!
MarvelsGrantMan136,Dawidek26,"I'm honestly considering just buying the manga instead of waiting another year, but I know it won't have as much of an impact as the anime without the soundtrack, voice acting and animation."
MarvelsGrantMan136,a_stoned_goat,"I saw an article saying that it will only be four episodes, each an hour long, releasing April 2023. Anyone else seen this?"
MarvelsGrantMan136,S1eeper,So I guess Gabi is mini-Sasha now.
MarvelsGrantMan136,bombaleyyo,I can't wait for Attack on Titan: The Final Season: Shippuden
MarvelsGrantMan136,Odd-Block-2998,2023: the real finale
MarvelsGrantMan136,Kieran_Smithy,So is episode 26 the cut off for the final season pt 2 coz I just finished watching up to there and can‚Äôt find any more episodes
MarvelsGrantMan136,luitse1,I was literally waiting this past 2 weeks for the new episode. To find out today they are doing a part 3ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è this is soooo pathetic beyond belief.
MarvelsGrantMan136,mexicanfluff22,Why is gabi still alive
MarvelsGrantMan136,Trick-Bar-377,I think my soul just left my body
MarvelsGrantMan136,Talian404,I'm not even exited they fucking ruined the anime with this garbage animation. 2013 animation looked way better than this shit . whoever made the decision to animate this way i hope your wife cheats on you with your best friend.
MarvelsGrantMan136,ItalianStallion9069,WAIT SO THIS MEANS THERE WILL BE MORE?! Oh my god yes
MarvelsGrantMan136,Fun_Christian_Pranks,Wait really so we will get a conclusion to that terrible ending
MarvelsGrantMan136,Sussy_404Error,"Oh so they decided to make it as a season instead of a movie

A movie would be so much better tho"
MarvelsGrantMan136,Tartan_Samurai,"What the actual fuck, I've been holding off on the 'FiNAl SeeZOn' till literally last week. On episode 27 and thought it was finally safe to peek the sub. This is the first thing I see. They're taking the piss."
MarvelsGrantMan136,_BatsShadow_,They‚Äôre in the shape of a butterfly...
MarvelsGrantMan136,indieliberal,Good grief. I'll have to rewatch Part 2 when Part 3 finally rolls around. Why don't they just call it Season 6?

Most normal beach episode in AoT"
MattyLlama,kagantamello,would love to see that
MattyLlama,aineri,They did have a beach episode moment at the end of season 3
aineri,onlyavailablename2,"barely, and it was significant to the plot, nowhere near filler, and it thankfully wasn't fan service so it hardly counts"
aineri,CR4ZYxPOT4T0,"You just said it.. ""moment"".. have a nice day."
MattyLlama,Radio__Star,The entire episode Eren is just staring incredulously into the horizon and occasionally pointing
MattyLlama,kenjitaimu69,They had a beach day filler episode and it had the most ominious season ending I can think of that I have ever seen ffs
MattyLlama,AutisticAndre,True
MattyLlama,BDM937np,"we kinda got that, best beach episode"
MattyLlama,BeeLegitimate4968,We would love that haha. We only got beach scene 1 time tho.

masterpiece. 

no one can beat this anime. 

every ost of this song is goated."
Divy4m_,kagantamello,![gif](giphy|BWhpkB6Xbe8FzfNLXw)
Divy4m_,abellapa,"And among the greatest shows of all time 

Calling it a masterpiece its almost an insult due to how mindblowing fucking good it Really is"
Divy4m_,unban_interaction,Yeah it‚Äôs obviously easy and supportive to say this on this aot sub
unban_interaction,Divy4m_,Yeah that's why I am saying it in aot right not in another anime sub
unban_interaction,syamborghini,"I‚Äôll say it in any sub idgaf it‚Äôs my opinion

It‚Äôs the reception which will be different depending on the sub"
Divy4m_,retro_Kadvil4,I agree man
kagantamello,Human293,"Yeah I agree. There are a few episodes here and there that are ""weak"" (I'd give them a 6/10) but they're still good"
Human293,syamborghini,Nothing below an 8 imo
syamborghini,DOOMFOOL,"Nah I agree with human, there are a handful of episodes id put closer to 6. I also had my share of issues with the ending but I don‚Äôt hate it like some do"
kagantamello,Many-Refrigerator941,Just finished a rewatch from start. Every episode everyscene matters and everything builds up perfectly. I cannot give up even a single scene.
Many-Refrigerator941,PessimistYanker792,"Thank you, second you, bless you!"
Many-Refrigerator941,Mission-Fox537,"Me too, am now at Season 4 part 2 of my re-watch"
Many-Refrigerator941,AstoundingAsh,I got bored when Ymir Reiner and Berthototo were talking after kidnapping Eren in my first watch and in the second watch i wanted more of that ‚Ä¶that convo was so intriguing just that in the first watch i knew nothing
kagantamello,Ok-Neighborhood-1958,Parts of season one were extremely dragged out
Ok-Neighborhood-1958,SteveFrench12,"Yea, while i enjoy every episode a lot of season 1 feels like half the episode is recapping the situation they are currently in and the other half moves the story a little bit"
SteveFrench12,LSOreli,Season 1 could have been 12 episodes if they cut out the monologuing and flashbacks.
Ok-Neighborhood-1958,AbstractMirror,"You're right but having seen so many other shows I couldn't in good conscience call a single season 1 episode truly bad. There's actually a lot of season 1 episodes that I even feel stand with the quality of later seasons

Maybe it's because I've seen some truly bad anime before, but even the more dragging episodes still have lots of great things to them in this show"
Ok-Neighborhood-1958,acupofcoffeeplease,If I recall correctly most of their cadet time wasnt on manga
acupofcoffeeplease,Ok-Neighborhood-1958,I think you‚Äôre recalling wrong. I‚Äôm pretty sure most of it was there but just after the battle
kagantamello,ecrass12,I couldn‚Äôt Name one
ecrass12,kinggoosey,And I couldn't Nami one either.
ecrass12,yeahitsblack,"Even the ""slower"" episodes had purpose. The consistent quality is what makes AOT stand out from other anime."
kagantamello,Yeomanticore,"There is, the last episode given the show has to end. Kidding, it ended well and probably one of the best."
Yeomanticore,kagantamello,![gif](giphy|y2i2oqWgzh5ioRp4Qa)
kagantamello,goltaku555,"Unpopular opinion incoming. I did not care for the beginning half of season 3. Hear me out, attack on titan is still in my top 3.

I didn't read the manga, I was watch only at the time. I was getting fed up with the whole 'humans are the real threat' trope you see in media way too often. That looked like the direction the series was going in, and there was so little attacking on titans, I wasn't feeling it. I thought I was watching 'Attack on titan' not 'Attack on person'. Plus the new op and ed weren't doing it for me.

HOWEVER. The second half of season 3 with the scouts vs Rein, Bert and Zeke is absolutely peak, and more than makes up for it's first half."
goltaku555,BDM937np,"S3P1 was EXTREMELY confusing (at first watch), I think its probably the worst adapted season from the manga they cut many scenes and because of this some scenes felt a bit weird.

I think we definitely needed some ""slow paced"" season after what we got S2 and we were going to get in S3P2, Id say that it probably the most important season concerning subplots and world building (maybe S4P1 got it better)"
BDM937np,goltaku555,"Oh yeah, plot and lore wise it's absolutely essential. But it's not an easy watch. I actually dropped the series for a while because of it. Really, really glad I picked it back up."
BDM937np,AstoundingAsh,Season 3 Part 1 was the weakest part even for me in the first watch ‚Ä¶up until Historia sets the stage on fire ‚Ä¶The government the inner police felt so boring after the peak episodes in season 2 where Eren controls the titans
goltaku555,Archers__World,https://i.redd.it/1tcrwjmf4mue1.gif
Archers__World,Flabberghast97,Dam it I wanted thatü§£
goltaku555,troublrTRC,"Yep, not a fan of the whole royalty arc for Historia. Kind felt convoluted and asked for a lot of faith in the studio. I fairly enjoyed the whole rod Reiss arc. And the beginning of the season was cool AF. But man, it was mid, some to the point of cringe. The excellent story beats and themes are still there, but it gets rightfully overshadowed by S2 and the masterpiece that has S3P2. And of course, I think S4 whole is transcendent fiction."
goltaku555,Traditional_Buy_8420,"I think I dropped AoT at S3E20. At the very least I watched S3E11. Had the Anime ended after S2 I still wouldn't put it into my top 10 Animes.

Mostly the pacing was too slow. I remember some action scenes revolving around Levi Ackerman which I liked a lot and he also had the best dialogue, but I'm still not a particularly big fan of him. Overall I didn't like the dialogue in AoT. I tried jap, eng and ger dub and nothing particularly clicked for me. I remember when I first saw a trailer I found the art style interesting, in hindsight I can't tell whether the parts of AoT which I found boring (I can't point any out in particular because they weren't memorable, also it's roughly 3 years ago since I dropped AoT) dulled the art style or to me the style didn't fit the setting, storytelling and pacing in the first place. I think part of it was the mood, like everything is doomed all the time. It's not even like I hate mourning or realistic moods in general, for example in Grimgar the mourning of a lost teammate was done really well and they reacted accordingly. I think it's more that they made proper plans accordingly, so one thing which sullies AoT for me is that so much is so hidden, that it's hard to tell in which direction the plot is going, so then it's harder for me to get invested to it. For example I liked the plans they hedged when when they started suspecting sth. inside the walls and obviously there were going to be twists ahead with that arc and there were and I liked it till there, but then after most of the twists were revealed again sth. seemed to drag along and make the pace slower than it needs to be, one thing is characters who hesitate to do what they must, but there's something else which I can't put my finger onto.

While I didn't drop Grimgar, I wouldn't say it's better than AoT per se. There's other Animes which I liked a lot less than the hype they brought with them, for example One Piece or NGE. Some of the Animes which I enjoyed a lot are Death Note, Kill La Kill, Re:Zero, Stein's Gate, Your Name."
kagantamello,Fafnir13,"There are some awkward episodes where things take too long in season 1. ¬†Probably stretched things to hit that 26 episode format. ¬†Those are largely gone from the rest of the series. ¬†While they don‚Äôt make any episode ‚Äúbad‚Äù it does make certain sections feel like a bit of a drag. ¬†One of the most notable is when Eren is thinking of going back to fight the Female Titan. ¬†There is so much back and forth over it with the other characters, plus some straight replays due to commercial break or episode endings (can‚Äôt quite remember which). ¬†"
kagantamello,azmarteal,I highly disagree but at is point it is meaningless to repeat what was already said countless times.
azmarteal,kagantamello,![gif](giphy|BWhpkB6Xbe8FzfNLXw)
kagantamello,all-knowing-unicorn,At least your a respectful stranger lol. Have a good one
kagantamello,totoropoko,"I kinda agree but I also don't agree. I didn't really love the whole fake king arc in Season 3 and it almost took me out of the show. I know Isayama was on a GoT trip at that time, and this is his version of intrigue. I can't put a finger on an episode and say ""This was bad"". It was fine mostly, but it also wasn't the show that came before and after it."
totoropoko,onlyavailablename2,why didn't you like it
totoropoko,bademeister404,"Yea, im currently in a rewatch and this is the part that got me like: Well, let's get this over shall we."
totoropoko,Over_Resist4232,Maybe Its because you are not interested in politics
kagantamello,otakos147,"I agree, no episode is bad even the ones where you get angry or cry rivers of tears they are all great, in my opinion"
kagantamello,Feegoist,I personally did enjoy every episode.
kagantamello,Wide_Astronomer4403,he might be the greatest of all time and its not ridicilous to say that
kagantamello,shii7u,Exactly.
kagantamello,WildAd8962,Based opinion
kagantamello,CrowAccomplished6995,"Truly a masterpiece... I think people often may not like it as much as I do, but not really HATE it
... Isayama sensei did such a good job with the manga and wit and mappa slapped us with the anime too!"
kagantamello,FauxColors2180,The fake king arc was confusing on first watch and took me out of the show a bit for reasons others said. Parts of season four felt like they dragged a bit too. I‚Äôd agree that there isn‚Äôt a single bad episode though.
kagantamello,CityAura,"The only part I was getting slightly confused by, was when the scouts were being hunted down. Idk why, but that whole situation kinda sped past me when I got to it the first time. Then, when it ended, it was like that whole charade didn't matter at all. Idk, it was like a quick problem that seemed like it was gonna be the next major issue for the protagonists, then it just ends quickly. Idk. AOT is still one my favorite animes!!!!!"
kagantamello,Redericpontx,Personally though the pacing of s2 was a bit too slow other than that great.
kagantamello,abellapa,Literally Peak Fiction
kagantamello,CJSM-935,I agree
kagantamello,VictorVonDoomer,I didn‚Äôt really like season 4 as much as the others tbh
VictorVonDoomer,nmpbones,Interesting take I‚Äôd like to hear your opinion
kagantamello,ripndipp,"I was so into this show until the end, I felt I was blue balled so hard to finally get the ending. I waited so long and til this day I haven't watched it. I probably should but I'm past the point of interest. Instead I found out what happened through the books."
ripndipp,kagantamello,maybe watching it would make you think in a different perspective ?
kagantamello,solomon-reigns,Agree! Loved from start to finish. I was engaged every second. On the edge of my seat for the final season and all its parts ü§£üòÇ. What an amazing anime!
kagantamello,ElmightyRip,Not a single bad episode bc the plot was just THAT goodü•π
kagantamello,GregaciousTien,"Wholeheartedly agree. The strongest piece Olof fiction I‚Äôve enjoyed, start to finish"
kagantamello,Memo544,I would agree. The show has very little filler. And I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a story point they botched.
kagantamello,elizabella710,Only parts I skip cause they‚Äôre boring are Mikasas backstory and gabi yelling for Reiner.
kagantamello,a-new-begining,I feel like trying to retwatch the first two seasons can be kinda difficult especially when even gets really edgy
kagantamello,silverfaustx,No
kagantamello,xyZora,More modern animes do this much better than older ones because they put the series on hiatus while they adapt each season. So the need for filler becomes unnecessary. And this is very good.
kagantamello,Ok-Rate6189,"I remember there was one episode in season 2 where i swear absolutely nothing happened. Like it was just all lore stuff, which is fine, but absolutely nothing interesting went on"
kagantamello,dmiller8605,I really need to start watching the series based on everything I've heard about it from everyone
kagantamello,Ghostbartender,Agree
kagantamello,wolfenx109,"I just binged watched through the whole series 2 weeks ago just finishing it this weekend for the first time.

Every episode either drives the plot forward or character/world builds. Very refreshing to watch"
kagantamello,RunPsychological9891,There were some episodes with way too many flashbacks
kagantamello,VastoBorde,Rock hard throbbing agree
VastoBorde,kagantamello,![gif](giphy|ANWIS2HYfROI8)
kagantamello,IceFisherP26,"S1 was very good and was what got me hooked, but compared to the rest of the series, S1 is pretty slow. That being said, S1 and S4 are my favorites. S2 and S3 are tied."
kagantamello,soggywaffle421,Yes
kagantamello,MrRocket81,"As a 41yo guy that watched plenty of anime and read a lot of different mangas i was reluctant to watch it. I meticulously select what I will be watching next. A coworker of mine, a 21 yo dude always insisted that i started watching it. In my defense, the promotional art wasn't really atractive for me, seeing a bunch of teens flying wielding swords gave me that SAO vibes of an OP MC that faces every enemy unfazed and just sweats at the final episode. I thought it will be a silly story with generic characters. 
Bored, I started it expecting just entertainment and some decent action scenes.  
Boy, I was very, very wrong.  
I finished the series just in time to wait a couple weeks for the finale. I loved every episode, every scene and every twist.  
I can't recall a more perfectly crafted story, that comes clean when you put together the pieces of the puzzle.  
I still hate Gabi and want her dead."
MrRocket81,kagantamello,"im glad you enjoyed it means more coming from someone who has a wide knowledge about this culture, and solid point on gabi üòÑ"
kagantamello,uNecKl,There were some slow moments but it left relaxing because we were getting cliffhangers after another every single episodes
kagantamello,Frytura_,"The flaws are mostly nitpicks and the ending fight could maybe have been a bit cooler and extended out on that section where Eren comes back up and fights Armin but god, its a peak show."
kagantamello,Professional-Pin5125,Season 1 was a bit of a drag in parts.
kagantamello,Livid-Truck8558,Not a mid episode either. Every single episode is important and entertaining. And that's the bare minimum of the average aot episode.
kagantamello,Cosmic_TentaclePorn,Every episode of AOT is pure cinema
kagantamello,Shady_Mania,Only episode I don‚Äôt like is the one after colossal and armor titans reveal themselves and run off with Eren after their fight and then hide in a tree for an entire episode talking
kagantamello,SendInRandom,"That‚Äôs what I was told before I watched it, and literally not a single bad episode"
kagantamello,jamesmerrick3,"The only bad episode was the last one, only because it insinuated the show had to come to an end"
kagantamello,Glad-Ad-9928,After watching all naruto and naruto shipuden i agree üòÇ
kagantamello,DarkFox160,"No, but I will say this image applies to the op's"
kagantamello,hinfort,"I did not exactly fw the two Ymir&Historia episodes and, after rewatching the anime, I'd usually skip the two in every further rewatch.

Weren't ""bad"" episodes. Just mid. Worst I could find."
kagantamello,CandidateOld1900,"I think I wouldve been happy without that one episode with 15 minutes flashback about spoon in the middle of the chase sequence. Or that one episode, where they sitting for the entire time in Trost with cannon pointed at them and Armin having existential crisis"
kagantamello,CallistoGamer,I always recommend AOT when someone new to anime asks which one to watch. It is one of the greatest animes and no one can argue
kagantamello,travel-mint,Season 1 & 2 were the best for sure.
travel-mint,AstoundingAsh,Season 3 Shiganshina Arc is the best Arc ever in all of entertainment history‚Ä¶.if you like Shonen style you have peak (Levi) ‚Ä¶if you like darker tones and want something to puzzle your brain you have Armin absolutely having a throbbing brain
kagantamello,ArachnidJealous8537,I dont agree with the ending but it was done perfectly. Bad writting decision but god-tier execution of it.
kagantamello,Sunshine_dmg,"You know, AOT is the best plot for an anime I have ever seen.

Character development? ahAHAHAHAHAHahahaha who cares about ANY SINGLE ONE OF THEM except for Armin. 

Eren's irreverence and stupidity is either GOAT or the worst character trait depending on who you ask. 

And that's on that"

Agreed"
kagantamello,Nerdcuddles,"I think S4 fell off (but not so hard it was bad, just not as good as season 3), it's just not good at handling the themes it tried to handle. And than the ending was just... bad."
Nerdcuddles,iPuffOnCrabs,The ending was perfect imo
kagantamello,Freddie040,Only episodes I don‚Äôt really like are eve of the counter attack. They were fine first time round but I skip them on rewatch
kagantamello,Raznuk_Venger42699,"Bad take incoming... First season is so boring at the beginning, worst season of the series (not necessarily bad, but not that good), Eren turns into a giant way too soon, controls his titan form to quick, and it only gets some proper pace in the last 5 episodes.

Second season is the best one by far, incredible outcomes and such outstanding plot twists, (no, Bertholdt and Reiner were spoiled to me but they were no obvios of being titans, it was still a surprise to me), specially with Levi vs Beast Titan, gorgeous fight. .

Third season part 1 is compelling very well executed, Kenny's backstory and the Founding Titan source, specially both Historia's and Eren's development were pretty great, even though it's not as good as the second one (Historia's father turning into a Giant giant titan was kinda lame ngl), still better than the first one.

Then, Third season part 2 which is an absolute masterpiece, second best season in AOT's anime, Eren vs Reiner was so anticipated for me, the way they defeated Bertholdt with that final outcome delivered by Eren since First season was an amazing final touch, or trying to decide between Armin or Erwin was breathtaking, and that cliffhanger is such a banger with Eren's dad reveal about Paradis and Marley, I fucking love it...

And then we have Fourth season, great plot twists, heartbreaking moments, yeah, but Warhammer Titan was such a disappointment, it didn't even last more than one episode, and lost its relevance that it gained a few moments ago, I mean, even the new animation gave me mixed feelings, and never got used to it, splitting it too many times in too many parts was exhausting, at lest the story was keeping us up for the vast majority, but it went downhill with Eren knowing all the past, being able to change his past, alter his own life, but doing absolutely nothing thinking he could not change anything when he could (maybe not but at least try it), then got me again when the formed an alliance against Eren, him being the final villain is a nice touch, but it all was planned by a stupid grown ass kid who did not wanted to Rey and fight against the past, let everybody else getting killed by the titans (how the hell there's a bunch of Colossal Titans when only one exists? How does that even make any sense?), Hange's sacrifice was sad but didn't have any real purpose than getting rid of her, and I wanted more of her dammit, and the final solution was for Mikasa to deliver the final kill and beheading Eren because she was the answer, only God knows which is that, and that's it? I mean, like that? C'mon, the outcome could've been better than that, and still I kinda like it, I simply requiere more context and justification for that final showdown, it doesn't make any sense but I think I understand where Isayama was coming from... And that well executed disappointing endless war that destroyed humanity over and over again... And I'm fine with that, it makes sense with how they've been acting with each other, but at the same time makes Eren's self sacrifice completely in vain and shallow, it served for nothing, leaving it as an open ending that goes to nowhere, and I get it, thematically it works and sounds great, but the execution man, it sucks...

And in the end, I still love AOT, it's still one of my favorite anime/manga of all times, not my top 5 though, but I don't regret watching it... I only wished for it have more sense and better execution I guess."
Raznuk_Venger42699,kagantamello,"i understand the dissapointment about the ending since i had similar feelings in the sense that i also wanted more because this man Isayama raised the bar so so high, he also left some things for the interpretation of the audience and i havent fully read the manga so i cannot compare the similarities.

when it comes to eren and his past the fact that he couldnt change the outcome, its a paradox timeline and always will be complicated, but the main reason for his sacrifice is for his friends and loved ones to live long and peaceful life and to have real freedom which he never achieved but he did that for others ,after they pass away the hateful cycle continues and we see that no matter what it will always continue

im not trying to disprove your points here im just telling my own opinions, like i said i also was waiting for a better ending in my own way but its a bitter sweet show at the end of the day most of the deaths makes sense in my perspective and was in line with the storyline

also some of lifes biggest concepts are done beautifly in my opinion like freedom, love, sacrifice and many more 

anyway thank you for sharing your opinions, it made me think of things in a different perspective üëç"
kagantamello,LVNAR3xp,def a decent bit of s3 p1 was weaker imo but that was really the only dip in quality. oh and the pacing for s1 was kinda scuffed too at times....good shit though
kagantamello,AirSpecial,"Finally, a perfect take"
kagantamello,AssumptionPitiful263,"100%, I can't even think for a boring moment. Even season 3 first part, that was boring for so many, I enjoyed it so much. Best show of all times for me. ‚ô°"

kagantamello,ShiftAdventurous4680,"Near perfect, absolute masterpiece. Especially how at the start they talk about wanting to reach the sea and that's where the anime ends, with the trio finally reaching the sea. Absolute perfect ending. There could not have been a better ending."
kagantamello,faskahaska,"S1 was super awesome from the beginning, keeping such intensity throughout without a single boring scene. All this while telling a story something we never saw before.
Then slowly in s2 we feel it's getting kinda flat.... And then they dropped such an out of the world twist which changes pretty much everything. This will remain with me forever, it's possibly the best scene ever imo.
And as everyone knows s3 is considered the best with such amazing scenes throughout both story wise and action wise.
And s4 telling the actual intention of the author in such an unexpected manner, changing pretty much everything we have seen till s3 - makes us feel that we know nothing.

I hope we will get more such series (someone please recommend if they know any)"
kagantamello,EmmaNielsen,"personally i feel like there are many unnecessary episodes.  I decided to re-watch AoT feel asleep few times.  Maybe cuz i know the plot, unsure.  But it is a bit slow."

kagantamello,JDe__,"I'm well aware that I'm on the AoT subreddit so not everyone will share my view, but you did ask for my opinion.

I was extremely absorbed for the first three seasons and was loving every bit of it, but I just couldn't enjoy season 4. I just really didn't like not being able to root for the main character and the fact that it persisted to the end left a really bad impression on me that it soured the whole show"
JDe__,kagantamello,"yea it had similar effects on many more people, you are entitled to your opinions and dont have to agree with anyone, even you like a show its not wrong to tell the negatives about it.

and thats why on the title i say 'imo'"
kagantamello,JDe__,"I will admit every part, including season four, is very well written. It was also the most hype season, so I don't want to sound too much like a hater."
kagantamello,Forward-Hearing-7837,I think it actually gets better as it goes on. I didn't love the first season
Forward-Hearing-7837,Aioi,"After I watched season 1, I thought it was a masterpiece and nothing would top it. Till season 2 came out. Then 3. Then 4. Then 4 agajn. Then 4 again. Then 4 again. Did I miss any 4?"
Forward-Hearing-7837,MeMyselfIAndTheRest,That's certainly... an opinion

kagantamello,VampireSlayed,"Terrible and rushed ending that did nothing in the end (eren could've just crushed the global armies and lived with his friends until they all die of old age since the world wouldn't recover in 70~ years to attack paradise) 

Literally a pointless ending"
kagantamello,FabulousPractice9703,Season 4 has the horses head ü•≤
kagantamello,KaizokuD,Last season is definitely not a good as the rest  in terms of writing to be honest
kagantamello,jacobjayr,AOT is great but it does have a few weak eps.
kagantamello,Ron_Bird,tbh i was not amazed by most of season two. too much talk and ride till it got wild.
kagantamello,xmac,"I enjoyed it all, but I kind of wished the scouts vs scouts kenny stuff would hurry along so we could get back to titans."
kagantamello,Fun_Bottle_5308,"Yes, they're not bad on average, but the last arc makes me feel rushed, and not as good as the rest tho. The vague reveal of Annie's power and proceeding to not use it at all, Historia's forced marriage to ""protect"" her whilst she could just hide harder or had Eren brainwash the government, signifying ErenMikasa's eternal love (twice btw) just to tear the fandom apart next page hinting she moved on with Jean. Again, fuck bully and Historia bs marriage, she deserves better, IDC if that farmboy changed or not, he contributed little to the story itself  (probably to satisfy the author's ntr fetish?)"
Fun_Bottle_5308,kagantamello,yea enough reasons to dislike the ending
kagantamello,realoneakash,"I recently started Attack on Titan and completed first 6 episodes. Till now, I'm trying to connect with characters and storyline."

kagantamello,TNCNguy,The ending of the final season sucked. Because the manga‚Äôs ending sucked
kagantamello,Full_Cod_1790,"I agree, everything is important and every ep has it. Best finished story's in anime/Manga"
kagantamello,Consistent-Soup-5093,Season 4 is a piece of shit
kagantamello,Giovolt,"The first half of season 3 was weak for me; Kenny was annoying and that pink hair chick died, I didn't care for historia's artificial growth, Eren was a pathetic baby until he punched himself 

It became GOATed with taking back Shinganshina"
kagantamello,Antix1224,I don't think season 4 is of the same quality as classic AOT
kagantamello,MentosMonkee,"I know i will get a lot of hate for my opinion, but for me the anime was too long. One season less would be better. The story and the ending was incredible. I cant think on another anime with such an plottwist."
kagantamello,solidpeyo,100% agree
kagantamello,valleysape,"I don't really like the uprising arc. Just got past it on a rewatch too. Isayama also said he didn't like it, maybe he's not that good at conspiracy plots but he is a master of twists"

kagantamello,Clear-Document-8877,"I‚Äôve been a fan since like 2015 or so and I really really loved the show and kept getting goosebumps when a new season dropped , But man when season 4 came out and I saw the different animation style with cgi I actually got so sad"

kagantamello,daojuniorr,"I dont remember the moment exactly (I believe its in the second season) but theres too much talk and politics, it feels like a filler, I was almost dropping the anime."
kagantamello,Bionicleenjoyer12,A whole lot of dick riding. It‚Äôs nowhere near ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. Not even that good actually
kagantamello,Crucenolambda,lmao the ending was terrible
kagantamello,DirtNo4303,"I loved it, but part 3 took out and changed a lot. Took out a lot of important conversations, took out Armin looking psycho for a second, that was supposed to be Levi throwing that guy, not Mikasa, the Survey corps was supposed to be shooting and slicing police, not ramming their carriage into a tent.


EDIT: plus Levi's smile. It made way more sense that HE inspired Historia with force, and Reeves told her she should punch Levi."
kagantamello,BassistAceGirl,Yeah totally agree. A masterpiece.
kagantamello,snowfloeckchen,The final was a disappointment for the shows standard but besides that I agree

Cortana_CH,MeMyselfIAndTheRest,Fake king barely affected the plot. Kenny arc was cool af.
kagantamello,jotapee90,"You gotta be shitting me, season 1, start of season 2 and season 4 were full of terrible eps. Even deason 3 with that Kenny arc was pretty whatever, but the rest of the season was goated."
kagantamello,iareslice,"I thought season 2 was one of the worst seasons of television I've ever seen. 1, 3, and 4 were fantastic. But in 2 the entire season happens over the course of 30 in universe minutes, where almost nothing happens, broken up by one or more flashbacks every episode."
iareslice,mr_roost3r,That‚Äôs wild seeing as how there‚Äôs a lot that happens in season 2. Season 3 was def one of the slowest one tho.
kagantamello,gesumejjet,Two of the OVAs were terrible. The ones which weren't based on any manga but written originally for the show ... not sure if they count but it's the closest rhing I can think of
kagantamello,kuzdwq,Ending was crap

kagantamello,chaddiffer8,Half the anime is mediocre episodes with some bads thrown in I had to take a 6 month break into season one out of boredom season 2 is all peak season 3 is the worst the anime has to offer until the battle near the end being peak again and season four is only mid to good with 0 peak episodes that being said I freaking love attack on titan an the Reiner and berthotld reveal episode is one of my favorite anime episodes of all time I‚Äôm just keeping it real the characters lack personality and likability compared to most anime I think it‚Äôs to keep the tone of everlasting somber
chaddiffer8,SeeThruSmoke,You only like pure action when the main characters are involved. Thats what it sounds like
SeeThruSmoke,chaddiffer8,What just imo the attack on titan characters suck and the anime is not carried by like characters being good at all I hated Erin mikasa and armin personally but especially mikasa

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,"magath must be a cat since he escaped death so many times in just one episode lol it was ""nice"" of him to admit that he himself is a devil when talking to willy.

also liked how the marlien army were shocked seeing paradis soldiers flying above their heads. although paradis soldiers were locked for 100 years they actually outdid them in something related to technology."
loveholic_99,Menetone,"Magath seems cool. He doesn't come across as a Marleyan devout, or Eldian hater. He's just doing his job. Calling him self the devil to me speaks volumes, he's not ignorant. That's how I see him atleast"

Menetone,AMK2201,"For some reason I think Gabi is gonna kill someone, maybe Sasha. That look Sasha and her shared.... And then Gabi picked up the gun.

Oh man pls don't kill off my potato girl"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jack1066,"Holy fuck the new Scout gear looks cool af, the Paradis people have really evolved into fearless titan killers after years of being plagued by them. Porco being shocked that they aren't even scared of him is just 10/10"
Jack1066,Dimmadeezy,They‚Äôve also evolved into fearless people killers as well. Sasha blew that dudes brains out right in front of Gabi. They‚Äôve changed so much over 3 years.
Dimmadeezy,Bring_Me_The_Night,"Sasha did the same with an arrow in the heart in Season 3. 

She also didn't kill a civilian, only the militaries, just like in Season 3."
Dimmadeezy,CubonesDeadMom,I have a feeling she probably should have blown Gabis brain out too
Jack1066,Xalbana,"Yep. Because it takes large military equipment to even damage a Titan in Porco's point of view.

But to the inhabitants of Paradis, having to deal with Titans on a daily basis and whose technology evolved around killing just Titans, they can go one on one with them and not be scared."
Xalbana,rares215,"That's what blows my mind the most. Since ordinary people rely on firepower, which isn't very effective against titans, the mere idea of zooping around with grappling hooks to SLICE the titans up with a tiny sword would only occur to the most insane of folk. When they need these huge cannons or trains to even consider taking on a titan, seeing these demons 1v1 them with ease must be as horrifying as it is awe-inspiring in some strange way. I love it."
Xalbana,5yk0515,"But the strange thing is, he should know this. As Porco reminded us and Reiner in episode 1, he has some, if not all of Ymir's memories. He should know how Paradis Eldians fight against Titans.

Reiner, Pieck and Zeke should have also reported that during the four years they've been back in Marley. Reiner especially, since he actually went through the training with the 3DMG."
Jack1066,Yourboyfibs,"It's actually just the gear that Kenny's squad used back in Season 3. They're prepped to fight people, not titans.

Notice how the only one who used the swords was Levi."

Garchomp_Z90,aenews,"That was incredibly messed up seeing Eren smash Sophia (and all those civilians). I didn't think he'd do it. Curious to see Eren's plan and wonder if it will truly be worth all this bloodshed.

Insane to think about how different this story would have been if Reiner and Bertholdt had switched sides and joined the gang when they reached out their hands. They had several opportunities to do so, it's absolutely sad that it has all come to this. And it's also absolutely sad that a bunch of kids basically were first forced into murdering countless civilians of an entire civilization (R.I.P. Eren's Mom). But this happens all the time in war, unfortunately, on all sides."
Garchomp_Z90,majurz,I didn't either. But I guess screen time will be scarce from now on. And now our favourite titan killers have appeared. I much rather watch more of them.
Garchomp_Z90,cheesemayne,I feel like another great episode is an understatement. This might be my favorite or maybe tied with the one where armin died
Garchomp_Z90,seraiss,"Feel bad for all who died when wall Maria was invaded , I mean they had reasons to do that after all they got - attack in first episode , Annie causing deaths of civilians in S1 if im not wrong and more others who died .

seraiss,jellyfishjumpingmtn,"It was worse for Paradis too. They werent bombed or shot at, or crushed with rocks. They were ripped apart and *eaten alive*. And Marley used this tactic against them on purpose; breaking the wall rather than attacking conventially.

geriatricgary,jellyfishjumpingmtn,"Ironically, isolating a portion of humanity in those conditions led to weird and unique developments that couldnt be forseen by either the Tyburs or King Fritz. They underestimated humanity's desire for freedom, and their willingness to venture beyond the walls.

This is why Paradis are so powerful against the titans and even regular military; they spent 100 years in isolation basically evolving in brutal conditions where only the strongest, and most agile in 3-dimensional space, survived.  

they have a huge advantage in urban warfare too. I originally thought Kenny &crew was some weird, filler-esque part of the plot that was written in for no reason. I shouldnt have underestimated AoT lol, everything in the show is connected"

Those people have been killing and fighting titans for years he is nothing to them"
geriatricgary,and1GS,duuuuude that hit so hard. Utter confusion as to why they wouldn't be afraid of a titan. What a ride this show has been. And what a trip out island devils have been on!
geriatricgary,Serbaayuu,"He's going to be made an example of.  He already has been, by getting smashed by Levi, but the only way to go from here is for them to destroy him and leave not only his view of the world, but the way the other Warriors see the world in shambles: though they already know it, the Paradisans will destroy ANY titan no matter how ""invincible"" it is meant to seem.  And they might even make it look easy."

agbtherealog,_ackerman_69,"Pieck was like ""oh we're fucked"". We all: HELL YESSS!"
Chasseur_OFRT,Phantombk201,You know? It should be called the 3D ziiip-pfff gear.
Phantombk201,leadz579,agreed
Chasseur_OFRT,Nearby-County7333,bro me too my heart STOPPED and i got hot chills all over üò≠
Chasseur_OFRT,Kayehnanator,That new gear set-up was so badass as well! Glad to see Paradis kept upgrading their stuff as well.
Kayehnanator,Chasseur_OFRT,"They went full super soldier mode. 

 I thought the milky titan was going to be the highlight of the EP, but god I had no idea... The Survey Corps stole the stage."
Chasseur_OFRT,Goosojuice,">Those clenched teeth just like Eren

I flipped when we caught our first glimpse of the team. The build up to this episode was wild."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gabyyyyu,"I love this episode specially when Levi appears it was awesome and also the music everything, My whole reaction was just Woww"
gabyyyyu,flappydicks,Can‚Äôt wait to see Levi in action again!
gabyyyyu,hummingdog,Forreal! Levi made me most happy that episode! God I want to hear his voice so badly! It‚Äôs been long Captain!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jakefiz,Damn didnt expect zofia to be the boulder titan
Jakefiz,lildeathgrips,Bruh
Jakefiz,A_Polite_Noise,"The Boulder feels conflicted about crushing a young Eldian girl.

*The Boulder is over his conflicted feelings.*"
Jakefiz,DovahDuck,Girl got nae nae'd.
Jakefiz,Garbycol,What does that make of Udo then? The Floor Titan?
Garbycol,Goblintern,"Foot titan!

Foot titan!"
Jakefiz,flat0earth,Bro what the fuck
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrDari,Gabi do be looking like Eren in S1
MrDari,ProfessorRigby,Those clenched teeth just like Eren
ProfessorRigby,Grayox,Those poor molars
ProfessorRigby,Reggie_156789,"Gabi is feeling the exact same rage Eren felt in season 1 its obviously a paralle, theres no true bad guy just two different groups both fighting their enemy."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,free_world33,"When Mikasa and Levi made their appearance I jumped out of my chair.  

It seems Eren was going to do this with or without them.  Mikasa did not want this and I dont think a lot of them wanted this but they came anyway.  war is hell."
free_world33,AdGroundbreaking6643,"It isn‚Äôt like they could just let Marley take the only thing keeping them alive, the founding titan, anyways. Eren kinda forced their hand."
AdGroundbreaking6643,free_world33,Yeah. No doubt. Mikasa is watching the guy she loves go down a path she cant follow and its hurts.
free_world33,chinchilla2132,I mean war was inevitable. Paradis was vulnerable and Eldians are still being mistreated. It‚Äôs unfortunate so many innocent people had to die though
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flappydicks,"‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you see I‚Äôm a titan?!‚Äù Like they haven‚Äôt been fighting these things for years. And now with even more advanced and upgraded tech, good luck Porco but they aren‚Äôt scared of you. Especially not Levi. Get ready to meet the Scouts, Marley.

Holy shit this scene was sick."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,merlemi,"I'm speechless.
That was Jean with the newspaper in the beginning wasn't it? The built up was amazing.
Everybody looks so badass.
I'm scared though, Eren seems to have gone a lil crazy... Maybe that attack wasn't the smartest move"
merlemi,fist_my_muff2,Mikasa makes it sound like Eren went on his own to start this
fist_my_muff2,chipthehippie,"He was sending letters, and mentioned to Mikasa he was glad she came"
fist_my_muff2,ThEcOmIcBoOkGuY19,She followed him tho. It sure must be hard to accept that someone you love isn't the same person anymore but she always kept doing what he wanted (so did everyone else). So I don't think we can excuse everyone with mental health and stuff in this case.
merlemi,Nearby-County7333,tbh eren seems a lot smarter now (but u cant change his reckless personality) so i literally wonder every time he makes a move if there‚Äôs some mastermind plan behind it
merlemi,I_The_Unguided,Was it? Based on what Mikasa said to Eren and Jeans apprehensiveness about all that murder I‚Äôm not so sure.
merlemi,enotherusername,"They declared war on his home, he had the opportunity to get the jump and took it. It was either paradis island civilians or Marly civilians. Yes killing civilians either way is wrong 100% of the time, that‚Äôs part of what makes war terrible. That‚Äôs the point of the writing here, that‚Äôs why mikasa acknowledged it, it‚Äôs not supposed to be justified, it‚Äôs supposed to be terrible, because it is."
enotherusername,merlemi,"But why would Mikasa say it during the attack? If it had to be acknowledged, why then? She can't be on the same page as Eren (for the first time ever lol)"
merlemi,shrek500_2,Jean was in the first episode too
shrek500_2,merlemi,"What, when? That's so cool"
merlemi,TheJuniversal,"Even without Eren attacking them, the crowd was cheery enough on the thoughts of attacking Paradis a second time. So Willy's assumption that the attack would cause an uproar towards Eren honestly does not mean that much because the world never has an issue killing Eldians anyway."
merlemi,freebandzben,I feel like eren in is do whatever it takes to save the world mode same way his dad was to steal the founding titan
merlemi,Kri5hie,GO OFF EREN. GO QUEEN :D
merlemi,LJExplainsTheJoke,"yes, it made me think about titan‚Äôs having actual power balance and counters, like how the war hammer slaughtered eren‚Äôs titan, but there is probably a titan that has a perfect counter to the war hammer out there"
LJExplainsTheJoke,MrMaleficent,"Nahh the War Hammer Titan seems broken as hell.

If it wasn‚Äôt for plot it could probably instant kill any other titan except for of course the founding titan"
merlemi,noctiszaoldyeck,"he kinda Reminds me of Daenerys from Game of thrones in the series, and Mikasa was like Jon snow reminding Eren he killed civilians and children."
merlemi,seething_stew,I also thought that for some reason the actor portraying Helos was Jean as well. It's just the specific way where his face is shown but I don't think thats plausible.
merlemi,ThEcOmIcBoOkGuY19,Eren? Everyone is following Eren like if he is some kind of god. Our heroes became the villains I think and it was shocking to see!
ThEcOmIcBoOkGuY19,LaCipe,To be honest....thats exactly how terrorgroups are born/created.
merlemi,ThatPeruvianDude,I‚Äôm still shaking
merlemi,Prof_Black,"Eren was sick of being pushed around.

And the world was about to attack Paradise again.

Eren just did a preemptive strike."
merlemi,BurnStar4,Yeah I almost feel like I shouldn't be rooting for the gang this time. Eren killed so many innocents....
merlemi,Flaymlad,Who was the one who trapped Pieck and Porco? >!Armin!< perhaps.
merlemi,PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,"There doing exactly what Reiner and Bertolt did and killing innocent civilians and children, which makes Erren just as bad as them, i guess thats the point but its sad to see him do this and not even bat an eye, i wonder what happened to him to make him this way?"
merlemi,ActionCookiez,Connie was also in one of the episodes for a slight moment that was very hard to miss
merlemi,postcardmap45,Which newspaper?
merlemi,McDragan,I think the newspaper guy may have been Willy but idk
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frosty4019,BRO I CANT LIVE WITH THESE SHORT EPISODES ITS KILLING ME
frosty4019,PvtLoco,"Yeah I know right?

 The last to be continued killed me. But this?? This one was brutal"
frosty4019,12ealdeal,"As someone who began binging this series last month.....I have no idea how anyÔøºÔøº of you could take this codependent abuse with ‚Äúto be continued‚Äù/ 1 episode per week and then months/years between seasons.

I‚Äôm grateful to be here now in the final season. But it‚Äôs mental how much energy and emotions I work through being fed less than 20 minutes per week."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,supernoodle15,That ending had me so fucking hyped. YOURE GOD DAMN RIGHT THESE ARE THE DEVILS OF PARADIS AND THEY COMIN FOR YOU
supernoodle15,surely-a-sir,"""can't they see I'm a titan!?"""
supernoodle15,inthe-otherworld,"Tbh the whole episode I was just chanting ‚ÄúSurvey Corps, bitch!‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LucHendriks2003,The levi reveal was hype asf
LucHendriks2003,Radix2309,"Zeke finally shows up to save the day

*sees Levi*

Understandable, have a nice day

*turns around and runs*"
Radix2309,ShaidarHaran2,"The last time they faced off, Levi didn't even have breakfast."
Radix2309,TheDarkSinghRises,I genuinely spit out my drink
Radix2309,TheOneShade,Levi absolutely wasting Zeke is one of my favorite scenes in the anime.
LucHendriks2003,Nearby-County7333,the ending scene where we got a shot of his eyes üò≠ LORDDDDD
LucHendriks2003,IQuoteShowsAlot,"I watched this alone and I legit said ""OH FUCK"" when I saw Levi"
Menetone,Elu_suario,it's like in The Boys when Homelander destroyed the blind super's hearing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Astral_Wish,I was left speechless after watching this episode. I truly believe with all my heart that AoT is one of the best shows ever.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YamFor,"Damn, Falco really fucked up huh"
YamFor,HellspawnedJawa,"If you ever feel like you fucked up, you'll never have fucked up as badly as Falco."
HellspawnedJawa,starwaver,Or Reiner
YamFor,Toddl18,Atleast he wasn't some dumb or naive character he actually realized how much he did last episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,skmd_siddique,WHERE THE FUCK IS ARMINNNNNNNNM??????!!!!???
skmd_siddique,antrix_AFC,"Recalling his only human scene from the trailer, he was all alone floating on a tiny boat. I am going to assume he is going to create a fucking tsunami next episode and wipe off the entire navy fleet that is mobilizing right now in one single wave."
antrix_AFC,theclassiclynx,Holy shit you just reminded me about the explosions in the water at 0:53 during the intro. THAT COULD BE THE SCENE
antrix_AFC,-ShaiHulud-,"Damn, that's an interesting observation. I didn't notice that scene with the boat, but it would make a lot of sense. No point transforming in Liberio since you're running the risk of wiping out everyone, including the Scouts and Eren. Dealing with the Navy would be a good move."
skmd_siddique,Grayox,Off somewhere using that brain of his!
Pushyourself2019,InstantNoodlesIsHot,"The story is what makes everything feel tight. The creator's (Isayama) storytelling is one of the best in any medium I've consumed. 

Attack On Titan is what I hoped Game of Thrones' storytelling would be."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I_The_Unguided,"Why is Porco shocked they‚Äôre coming to kill him? He knows what happened to Reiner, Bertolt and Annie."
I_The_Unguided,verticaluzi,"I love his reaction so much, because he was basically calling Reiner a bitch in the previous episodes for failing at Paradis.

He has no idea what the scouts are capable of. Soldiers who have dedicated their lives to exterminating titans"
I_The_Unguided,In_Dux,Probably one thing to hear about it and a whole other thing to see a bunch of puny humans about to seal your fate like it‚Äôs a part of their daily routine.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sx-gabe,"WAS I THE ONLY ONE WHO KEPT ON GETTING CHILLS THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE!?!?!?? 

WHAT A FUCKING EPISODE!!!!!

edit: I can‚Äôt stop shaking & jumping from excitement."
sx-gabe,sailor_usagii,Same! I literally stood up and clapped to myself when Levi showed up lol
Kid__Winchester,PhatDib,Yeah I think they‚Äôre trying to set up gabi colt and falco as the next eren mikasa and armin
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,implordofall,Shortest 23 minutes and 54 seconds ever. The new scout regiment outfits are awesome.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,geriatricgary,Can we talk about the new Scout uniforms? Fucking awesome
geriatricgary,kuttykaliko,Can we talk about how Levi refused to change his get up. Dude was the only one still in Scout green using his blades. Total legend.
geriatricgary,In_Dux,Reminded me a bit of XCOM 2 armor when it‚Äôs first upgraded.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Alexandre_Man,"That was the best episode so far.
But the concerning the Hammer Titan... what the hell is that titan? It can just spawn weapons like that, it's so op. Plus its user doesn't have to be in their neck."
Alexandre_Man,Jack1066,"Except when its in the nape the titan can move around and dodge to protect. When it is in that chrysalis it is in a way, more vulnerable to another titan doing what Eren did"
Jack1066,it_is_whatitiz,"I am going to guess that the user can reside in the nape, just the Marleyans decided that they could surprise eren ect by moving the weak spot. If the attack wasn't so well organized you could expect the tactic to fool eren."
Alexandre_Man,Eggishtrain,"I was saying that this titan is way too op but then Eren ""unplugged the wifi"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kinmin1,Everybody gangsta until your hometown gets blown to bits by an attack from a Titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Saivanh,"Eren, why did you unplug the wifi????"
Saivanh,It_is_The_SainT,Porco: Zeeekkke! Eren unplugged the Wifi!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,edentron,Biggest takeaway from this episode is that floch got rid of that yee-ee ass haircut
edentron,verticaluzi,And Mikasa went for that Eren season 1 haircut
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,L1GHTG30,Another essentially 10/10 episode
L1GHTG30,Phantombk201,Should be rated 9/9 tbh
Phantombk201,yaboinigel,"Nah, 8/8 gr8 episode m8"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheMysteryMan122,Didn‚Äôt expect to see Levi so soon. Thought they were gonna just give us a taste today.
TheMysteryMan122,manan_j19,"I think it was just a taste. The next episode is called the ""assault"" XD."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StoneHex_,"I was worried the titan fights would look less intense or cool, they definitely feel different but it‚Äôs not a bad thing, the score when the squad showed up brought me back to the old days, it has much more brutal setting with the kids crushed and innocent people screaming for help.

Makes Levi & co look like the villains but they‚Äôre not, it‚Äôs just two sides of a war where there are victims and survivors.

I fckn love AoT bring it on 

I loved the episode."
StoneHex_,Rs90,Them hiding behind the rock while the crowd stampeded outta there was straight outta Season 1. Did a fantastic job of paralleling the feeling of turning the tide against them. It was brutal.
Rs90,verticaluzi,Yup. That scream from Gabi when she saw Sophia crushed under a boulder... reminded me of Eren watching his Mom being eaten
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,"Galliard got dunked on so fucking hard. 

1. Got rekt by Levi (my condolences)

2. Denied an escape 

3. Became the sole target of the entire Legion of veteran titan killers 

All within about a minute. Triple slam. Thanks for playing!"
Ruckzuck236,EternalCanadian,"Also he knows that technology is at a point where Titans are obsolete. 

He's just a cocky bastard though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SekaiQliphoth,Eren did a cannonball into the crowd the way I do in the pool Lmao
SekaiQliphoth,le_snikelfritz,"so much happened after that, I almost forgot how hilarious that full body slam into the crowd was"
SekaiQliphoth,Nearby-County7333,i really thought he flew for a second there LMAO
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jcooper935,"This episode was absolutely amazing, each episode gets better and better. Seeing Levi appear made my day for sure. Also, I won a $50 bet that the first word Mikasa would say in the season was ""Eren"" so that made me more excited that usual. Inane job overall, loved every minute of the episode"
jcooper935,lordofthekebabs,which idiot betted against that lmao
lordofthekebabs,daisy_no,Honestly
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sculpinn,"So much hype this episode 

-War Hammer titan was so bad ass and perfectly done 


-Solving the weakness of the War hammer titan was genius on Eren‚Äôs part


-Gab i‚Äôd look at Sasha mirrored Eren‚Äôs when he saw his mom get ate


-Levi had a spectacular entrance, totally forgot about him for a moment 


-Mikasa telling Eren ‚ÄòCome home‚Äô and he has the lost look on his face 


-Porco realizing Paradis humans are wild and they can take him down


-Beautiful to see how the ODM gear the developed fighting the titans on Paradis is being used to seige Liberio. Totally out classing soldiers there

-Eren‚Äôs dive to find the maids body was hilarious"
sculpinn,simplyleen,I literally forgot about Levi for a second too because I was to busy fangirling over how badass mikasa was. Levi‚Äôs entrance was awesome. It was such an amazing episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrypticRD,Scary how similar the civilian casualties were to the first season
CrypticRD,Nearby-County7333,it really is just gonna be an uno reverse especially the parallels between gabi and eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrypticRD,"Sad they used Levi's entrance as a cliffhanger, I was really hoping for a KennyLevi type scene. Maybe next ep"
CrypticRD,IQuoteShowsAlot,I think we may see some Levi vs Zeke next ep
IQuoteShowsAlot,pettyhonor,I hope that levi just does what Levi does best and wipes the floor with zeke. I would not be remotely mad if there isn't much of a fight and it's just Levi obliterating him
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,luke-ms,The scouts steam rolling the marleyans and then flying towards Porco in the end is imo one of the most bad ass things that ever happened on AoT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,free_world33,"Did anybody notice that the true demon, Levi was the only one carrying swords."
free_world33,Twindo,"These damn kids and their new fancy toys. Back in my day, killing Titans only required a pair of oversized box cutters."
free_world33,Jubilantyou,Also wearing the scouts cape
Jubilantyou,MahatmaGandhiCool,Erwin smiling from above...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,romanNood1es,Jaws really thought he was about to become the main character.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Phantombk201,"Insane. Just insane. The moment that the episode continued where we left off, I had my mouth gaping wide as open as Annie's mouth when she was biting Eren out of his nape in S1... Regarding the CGI, the only thing that was MAYBE.. MAYBE not up to par to the previous seasons was the 3DMG movements, but i was too busy enjoying the explosions and almost crapping my pants to notice.

 9/9 Episode.

Sidenote: The Warhammer titan reminds me of Frozon. Lol."
Phantombk201,KingKRhule,I also think it's because we're seeing the 3DMG from Marley's perspective. They are moving insanely fast. For me it added to the intensity of the battle
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Edgy0515,"I don't know about you guys, but I was shouting everybody's name when I saw them. This was a damn good episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CBSteeler7,Does anyone know what would have happens to the nine titans if Erin ate the maid girl. Will 3 of the 9 be ‚Äúin him‚Äù leaving only 7 in the world (including him)
CBSteeler7,Adthay,They've mentioned before that if someone dies without passing the titan on that it gets inherited by a random Child of Ymir so it's possible the Titans have been combined in the past then spread again when someone died.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Endo_Dizzy,"Every time a member of the survey corps appeared I smiled like a goofy child seeing boobies for the first time, it was just awe inspiring after all this time to be quite honest. And then the way Porco came in thinking he had it in the bag and got his jaw dismantled instantly by Levi. I just lost it. I'm still curious if the Warhammer titan is able to do something with her lil diamond egg or if its over for her from here on out. Now another 7 days of angst and nothingness."
Endo_Dizzy,Eggishtrain,I was wondering why Galliard couldn't bite Eren's nape. Now I know it was because Levi cut his jaw.
Endo_Dizzy,Suspicious_Photo3422,"To be honest the warhammer titan is in a big disadvantage now, i doubt she even has the energy to transform again, even if she did, Eren knows what's up now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlueAnon_59,‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why Uda and Zofia had to die.‚Äù Sounds real familiar huh?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,batu6767,"Hooly shit this was the best episode in this season so far and it‚Äòs just getting started. Finally we‚Äòre seeing our squad again after 1 1/2 years and they are looking freeeesh. The new gear looks also pretty dope, I‚Äòm especially digging this new pistol/grappling-hook hybrid"
batu6767,NOMERVARIUM,Pistol/grappling gear is not new. Kenny's squad used them in season 3.
NOMERVARIUM,LordTachancka,"yeah but now they are like magazine pistols, not just one big canister. Everything about the new odm gear is upgraded."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Phantorex,"The most amazing thing to me is, how Paradies even have a advantage in certain technologies and styles of fighting , because of the titans thread in paradis and that is giving them a huge advantage in the city. In Addition they are way more expierienced because most of marleys troops didnt really fight much, it was mostly eldians which fought the wars and titans for marley. Meanwhile the scouts now have multiple veterans because of the fights in the first three seasons."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,martnRULES,Eren breaking out into full sprint and double elbow dropping onto Marley‚Äôs Top Brass might be the most disrespectful shit I‚Äôve ever seen in an anime.
martnRULES,Whacky-Tobaccy,That one guy who just accepted his fate... chills
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lifstu,What happened here lol
lifstu,cbfw86,Comments from people who watched the unsubbed version.
cbfw86,cybersidpunk,subbed is out?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tomas481516,"That was a GREAT episode but I feel like the tridimensional scenes of the squad could have been way better, I‚Äôm still thinking of the Livai V Kenny scene in season 3. 
Also, can‚Äôt wait to see what my boy Reiner is up to."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Teriyakijack,"Good god, I couldn't wait for subs to be out. My almost non-existent Japanese carried me enough. What a banger of an episode. Thought it'd be all Eren VS Titan from last week's preview but the scouts all coming back full force. 10/10"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Man0nTheMoon915,"What an entrance by Levi!!!!


I can‚Äôt wait for Levi vs. Beast Titan next!!!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,"Mikasa's ""come home"" and the shots of the dead civilians has me feeling conflicted. Like yeah it's a point of no return for Eren, but also don't forget 1) Marley started this with an attack on civilians (including Eren's mom), 2) Marley and the world just declared war on Paradis, 3) Marley is full of racist assholes who have been terrorizing the peaceful islanders of Paradis for 100 years, and 4) a few episodes ago they were talking about how they absolutely need to take Paradis Island for the resources and time to reconsolidate their military around growing technology rather than the titans, so they're definitely coming for Paradis. They brought this upon themselves, and they deserve it.

On the other hand, these civilians did not make those decisions and they don't deserve it. If all of this goes back to the murder of Eren's mom, how many mothers and families have been killed by him just now? I'm certainly not happy to see him become the very monster he swore to destroy, consumed by hatred. But like Armin said, in a world as cruel as this only those capable of sacrificing their humanity can rise above monsters and change things.

Idk, the whole moral situation is just so good and complex. Love this show."
DrPikachu-PhD,Skankalite,"I agree with you! It sucks, but also, what options does Paradis have? They are severely outmanned and overpowered in terms of resources. A drastic measure like this is one of their only options if they seriously want to fight to win, and by win, I mean literally survive annihilation."
DrPikachu-PhD,shewhololslast,"One interesting thing was the conversation last episode about how the people of Marley are ultimately indifferent to the true cost of war and eager for warfare because it's something they perceive and benefit from through the newspapers, from a distance. 

The civilians are only innocent in that they aren't directly acting, but they would have supported the war on Paradis and not cared a wink about the slaughtered ""devils."" Experiencing violence directly makes things real for them. Unfortunately, as was the case for the Paradis people years earlier, they don't fully grasp why they're being attacked. Everyone's a victim following a brainwashed narrative."
DrPikachu-PhD,callmehalleluja,eren and the others are justified in *why* they are doing it but not so much in *how* they are doing it - at least not eren imo
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,agoe8,"There have been so many disappointing fantasy/ sci-fi shows over the years that never lived up to the hype. Genuinely so satisfying to watch a show that sets up an interesting, multi-faceted conflicts and when it‚Äôs time to show a battle, they‚Äôve delivered every. single. time. Love this show"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kxvin65,Damn I clicked play and my apple watch told me I had a heartbeat of 120 BPM.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ChickneNuggetOreos,Bro how tf is marley gonna compete against this shit
ChickneNuggetOreos,Nearby-County7333,lowkey feeling like this comment is gonna jinx it LMAO
ChickneNuggetOreos,Dio-Dio-Dio,"Don‚Äôt forget they have Zeke, imagine the beast Titan throwing grenades like pebbles. The armored Titan is still pretty good, and pieck will be nice for taking out the scouts due to her mobility and the guns precision. Just playing devils advocate here though"
Dio-Dio-Dio,Demox_Official,Don't forget that the scouts still have **N U K E  B O Y**
ChickneNuggetOreos,it_is_whatitiz,Well in an urban environment they cant do shit. But in any open area good luck zooming through machine gun fire.
ChickneNuggetOreos,Menetone,The whole world is against them now. I think Marley isn't the only problem here otherwise it'd be simple imo. They got a lot on their hands now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cjaay__,So is gabi gonna turn into someone just like little eren did. I notice a lot of similarities between her and when eren was a kid
Cjaay__,ReggieEvansTheKing,The whole ‚Äúnew flock of kids becoming the season 1 kids‚Äù reminds me alot of the final season of The Wire.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShaidarHaran2,"I like how Eren didn't do the anime thing to do in waiting for a transformation to complete. ""Nope. I punch."""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Grayox,"That was the best 24min of Anime I've seen in my life, well done Mappa!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Caffinated_Tomat,I love that Levi is still wearing some old scout gear and everyone else is all new.
The_Caffinated_Tomat,Twindo,He kept the cape. He‚Äôs wearing the black suit underneath.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pandachyan,Had constant tingles throughout. WOW.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nearby-County7333,SASHA I FEEL LIKE UR GONNA REGRET STARING AT GABI OH LORD PLEASE IM CRYING
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,taskkill-IM,"Mikasa low key naive thinking that they would've been better off staying on the island...

Marley wouldn't have given up until all eldians on paradise were dead and they retook the founding titan...

Only thing I'm scratching my head at is how will eren be able to activate the founding titans ability? Would eating Zeke or Historia work? or would he have to pass it onto someone like Historia?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AAABattery03,"Watching Porco be absolutely terrified when he notices that the scouts are running towards him and not away from him like he‚Äôs used to with other humans... 

So amazing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dio-Dio-Dio,"I got one thing to say. If eren was about to eat the War hammer Titan despite it being in hardened Titan flesh, does that mean that they could have done that to Annie? Where is Annie, and Where is Armin. I need to see my coconut boy. Episode was amazing though"
Dio-Dio-Dio,malipir8,"All those questions lead to spoilers. Just wait for the next episode, it's as good as this one."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AWildLoneWolf,Eren defeated a titan by dolphin diving it's socket and unplugging it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,guapgetter2,"Man, this episode was insane I got goosebumps when they flew in with their ODM gear. I wonder if Armin is going to show up as the colossal titan soon"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KirkDaJerk,I bust out laughing when Eren straight up Double Elbow Dived into those military officials!!!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nearby-County7333,the part when colt and gabi were trying to get udo admitted made me realize that this might open some eldians eyes. i mean it‚Äôs obvious from the conversation of magath and willy but i feel like hospitals refusing people is definitely gonna make people see how cruel their world is
Nearby-County7333,Twindo,Hospital didn‚Äôt refuse Udo because he is Eldian. They refused him because they were under staffed and had too many patients. Not to mention he was already dead.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,katehestu,"Porco being shocked that mere humans would try and attack a Titan was SUCH a satisfying scene. Like you‚Äôve locked these people up with Titans, Titans and more Titans for 100 years. You are like a fly to them now omg"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrHikigaya,"* Except CGI. Yes I hate to say it but except CGI everything was top tier. 
* I'm starting to like Captain Magath. He's straight-forward and be spitting facts. 
* I honestly didn't believe that Willy would really die. 
* I was horrified with happened to Sophia and then later to Udo. 
* Eren should listen to Mikasa.
* Sasha joining the ranks of Mikasa and Annie in terms of hotness.
* Connie looks great and Jean is no more a horse.
* Gabi is the Eren we grew up with.
* Levi joined the party with the speed of Mach 2.
* I like Porco. I don't want him to die. Reiner save him please.

This attack somehow looked more gruesome than that of Bertholdt and Reiner's in S1E1."
DrHikigaya,triggerhappy66,"Magath is giving me Erwin vibes, calling himself the devil and sacrificing many of his soldiers and people for the ultimate goal"
DrHikigaya,Jubilantyou,"""Jean is no more a horse"" hahahah"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,Levi standing on the broken tower like Batman waiting for shit to go down. EPIC
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Osmosis_Jones_,Alright armin. Where tf u at üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JGuilherme02,Seeing Mikasa like that broke my heart
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shaponja,I love how The War Hammer Titan was making a grand enterance and Eren just starts beating the shit out of her mid transformation
Shaponja,LuiTurbo,That‚Äôs the Eren I needed in season 2
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Imagine if the warhammer Titan just whipped up an AR-15 and starting filling everyone with holes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ObamaEatsBabies,"People really complain about the animation a lot lol, story comes first, animation quality 2nd imo"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,prooijtje,"I remember being so frustrated in the first three seasons that the ""good guys"" (this episode made things a bit more grey) were always taking massive casualties while barely turning defeats into stalemates. 

Got me so hyped seeing them absolutely dominate a battlefield for once. Everytime a Marley unit or titan seemed to get the upper hand, Paradis Island brought something that the Marleyians hadn't expected. And it wasn't just Mikasa or Levi being prodigies; ALL members of the corps stepped up as shown in the last bit with all of them immediately jumping on top of the downed Titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Roguecraft10167,Oh my god I just realized;that scene where Connie and Sasha place the light on the tower.....it was to signal Armin to attack! I can't fucking wait to see his titan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dnavidsonic,Can I just say that when Mikasa is running on the wall her steps are line up with the music PERFECTLY and It's the most satisfying shit I have ever seen
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OGFN_Jack,"Honestly the greatest thing for me about this episode was just being able to truly realize how much the tides had turned throughout the years. 

Just 5 (?) years ago the scouts achieved their first real victory ever when most of their new recruits were slaughtered and their titan proved he had little to no control over himself because they plugged a hole in the wall that had been created easier than you can count to 3. Fast forward to season 3 and you have less than 10 soldiers come as close as possible to killing the armored titan, someone with 0 confirmed titan kills and a half conscious titan defeat the colossal titan (and be able to absorb his powers), and one single soldier defeat the beast titan with ease and force him to flee at the mere sight of him. 

Then you get to the most recent two episodes of season 4 and watch Reiner‚Äôs heart drop as their pure fear he has of Eren arises when he sees them, Pieck look on in astonishment and fear as she sees that ODM once again, and Gaillard be in complete disbelief as a bunch of ordinary humans swoop down on him to finish off one of the 9 titans with no second thought in their mind. 

I recently just binged AOT up until the most recent episode, so maybe it clicked for me later than some of you. That being said, realizing that the people of paradis were finally the hunters and not the prey was absolutely amazing to me."
LuiTurbo,TrungTH,That's literally Annie's crystal if not stronger. If there's a titan who's the best at hardening it's Warhammer.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shahdarawala001,Is it just me or this episode was the most brutal episode of AOT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Plague_Knight1,"Puberty hit Connie like a fucking armored titan

In all seriousness, what an episode. Warhammer is badass as hell, the scouts are using Kenny's anti-human ODM gear, and Marley doesn't realize that they've spent 100 years training Paradis to kill titans.

The only thing I dislike is Mikasa's design. She looks way too much like a guy. The sharp jawline, the square eyes, and the short hair just don't match the voice, and it's jarring."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,handinmyasshole,"Do you guys think that the writers had the Warhammer titan's weakness on it's heal as a reference to an ""Achilles heel"" ?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jillmmmm,"For everyone who is saying that Eren unnecessarily killed innocent people. Yes, he did. BUT let me bring up two things:

1. Reiner explained that the reason he destroyed the wall was so that they could slip into the chaos. Was it necessary to break the wall? Absolutely not.

2. Tybur KNEW this attack was coming and knowingly set up the stage and groups of people so that they would die. So is it really just Eren in the wrong or is it Marley as well for allowing this to happen?

This is war. Yes, Eren could've taken the peaceful route, but do you really think that the Marleyan's would have taken the peaceful route in eradicating all of Paradis Island? Do you think that if Eren somehow killed nobody in his attack that Marley wouldn't sacrifice their own people to benefit themselves?

Eren may be the bad guy but someone needed to be. I love Mikasa and her peaceful mindset, but it's kill or be killed especially when Tybur had just declared war.

Plus, all of Marley craves war. Now, they have finally seen it first hand. Is this really what they wanted? I don't think so."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GutsyEddy,War Hammer Titan was really about to end Eren! She didn‚Äôt care about eating him she wanted revenge for her brother!!! What an episode!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rhodesilla,"Hi guys! does someone remember how to close their mouth?

I was watching the new episode entirely open-mouthed from all the shock and excitement and I don't think I remember how to close it anymore, please help!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tinytitanic,"Mikasa looks weirdly different to me, lol. I remember her being way prettier, maybe it's because I haven't been seeing her for the last 20 years since the last season but yeah, she looks like she came straight from some JoJo anime or something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Levi to Eren: how many times am I going to have to save your sorry ass?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,One_Eyed_Sneasel,So since Eren knew he could eat that shifter in the crystal do we think that means that someone has already eaten annie in hers?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,heartbreakhill,"I just wanna say the OP has officially reached ""Banger"" status for me. Nothing's touching Sasageyo obviously, but those violins are just *chefs kiss*"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pineapple_is_Gud,"Is it bad that I wasn‚Äôt on Paradis side in the last 2 episodes? I got attached to the Marley side that I‚Äôm seeing the original crew as enemies. I was so scared for Reiner during the basement talk. I was quite sad that Udo and Zofia died. I‚Äôm scared for Porco. I think this is the theme of Attack on Titan. To show that there‚Äôs no angels and devils on the battlefield, only people."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tomas481516,"(Unpopular) 
I love Gaby, she‚Äôs got so much character & depth already and we‚Äôve seen the girl a few episodes only."
Tomas481516,OttoVonChester,I feel like we relate to her because she and Eren have a similar arc
Tomas481516,Menetone,"> Porco

I hate the possibility that she's gonna end up killing a bunch of scout members. She's got Eren's eyes man, that shit aint no joke lol"
Menetone,Slufoot7,"Just hope she doesn't obtain titan shifter powers or has secret Ackermans to protect her lol. 

If Eren wasn't a titan shifter he literally would have died immediately because he's a suicidal maniac"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DazrBlade,"First of all, I know this was supposed to make us empathize with the eldians and the marleyan empire....but I just couldn't.The eldians are such hypocrites, they kill their enemies but dont expect them to fight back, wtf is with that?And the empire is even worse, making themselves look like victims? Now, I also know that the people of paradis are not innocent but AT LEAST they admit that what they're doing is extremely wrong, however they have been given no choice but to defend themselves.This is Attack On Titan's greatest moral: there is no right or wrong side, simply the defeated and the survivors(not winners)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Indianlookalike,"I think we can all agree on 2 things;

1- That last bit about demons of Paradis island was sick

2- Flock is still an asshole."
Indianlookalike,Twindo,Floch is a cold motherfucker and a real one.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Peperoniboi,"i hate cgi but with the amount of action and fast peace we have this season im fine with it. Great epsiode, awesome music choices. Great job MAPPA! See you next week!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aluki,"It was so satisfying seeing the reverse happen to marley. How during season 1 it seemed that titans were these unstoppable and diabolical monsters and struck fear into every heart and soul. And I still remember the fear I felt after seeing the female titan show up and how she decimated levi squad in the forest. To now seeing new levi squad strike head first against galliard. That fear has been completely reversed. He knew he was fucked when he saw them rush in on him from all directions. Call it what it is. They are titan killers. They trained every bone in their bodies, sacrificed so much to come this far. They dont fear anything anymore."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Axis_itsnotme,"So War Hammer Titan's Last words were ""Do you have Any Last Words?""Lmaoooooo"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gigi_1803,"I was re-watching the anime and I noticed when Mikasa first stabbed on of the guys who killed her parents, she had that Titan transformation lights around her. She is also an Ackerman and all the Ackermen we know are inhumanly strong. Could it be that they're human sized Titans?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mml11,"What an INSANE EPISODE. First of all, the animation is incredible. I have nothing but praise for MAPPA. Second of all, I LOVE THE NEW SCOUT DESIGNS SO MUCH!!! I absolutely cannot WAIT for next week."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joel04300,"Imagine being an animation studio that gracefully took the mantle of animating a show that was dropped by another studio just so the fans could have it sooner and they just shit on you despite having 7 months preparation, and a 1 week deadline per ep,"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,doubleABC,"Episode was good too many hype moments but I felt the animation was lacking a bit especially the scouts ( levi was great ), the warhammer vs eren was a bit underwhelming and the ost were ok.

I have to lower my expectations anime wise but this is still the best story telling ever so many wtf moments can‚Äôt wait for next week"
doubleABC,Tomas481516,Levi is THICK now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KA1N3R,"Honestly, the less complex animation during fight scenes here compared to S1-3 is a bit jarring. Still a great episode, but sometimes the CGI looked really bad.

But it's not just the CGI looking bad, it's just how many shots we're not getting, especially in human v Titan Battles."
KA1N3R,Nearby-County7333,tbh i don‚Äôt even mind the cgi on titan fights but it‚Äôs the cgi on regular characters that saddens me
KA1N3R,ItsAshlisticAK,"Yes you are right! I really really miss the thick outline animation, pretty eyes with sparkling in them and that sky! This season seems a bit rushed till now but I guess it is to give us feeling of being in war..... NOTHING will ever beat previous seasons animation especially S3 part b, it was something else....(from anime only perspective)"
KA1N3R,Rowyn97,The fight choreography and direction has really suffered. Which is sad. I think that people have forgotten the quality of animation we got in the previous seasons.
Rowyn97,projectsynthx,Really what I was thinking the whole episode. Story wise it was an amazing episode but animation wise I wasn‚Äôt really sold on it
Rowyn97,KA1N3R,"I just rewatched the earlier seasons and you're exactly right. Fights looked so much better, especially big ones like this."
Rowyn97,cronicmole,exactly - I remember when Eren fought Annie and Annie's fight movements were beautiful.
KA1N3R,McFlare92,"Gotta agree. Watch Eren spank Reiner and tell me it doesn't look 100x better

https://youtu.be/hyEbggGnT0U"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Potato girl doesn‚Äôt fuck around holy shit.
Twindo,hrdp453,Gabi finally got to get a glimpse of potato girl eh? Reiner hyped her so kuch lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CruderCord7,"Craziest part is, (and I don‚Äôt read manga) Eren doesn‚Äôt want to do this to people. You can tell from his conversation with Reiner, to his silence when Mikasa talks about him murdering innocents. I also watched AfroSenju react to the last episode and he mentioned how they draw lines around the character‚Äôs eyes to represent stress and distraught, and eren always has those lines around his eyes, even though he always seems expressionless"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,civ_gandhi,"Porco's shock at seeing Paradis' guys easily take him down also signals the era of technology eclipsing the might of the Titans. 

What a scene that was"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justapotato9,"I was hoping for a longer battle with the Warhammer but then I realized even if it has such a useful skill, it's so weak because tybur's sister is just not used to fighting and I LOVE IT, it makes sense and imagine if one of the scouts gets to to be one, marleyans gonna be so fucked

and that last scene of the scouts flying in the air and ended with Levi OMG thanks mappa for another great episode!!"
justapotato9,hrdp453,"Yes, I agree. His sister was inexperienced with wielding the titan's true powers and obviously has never trained or sparred with another abnormal titan before which is why it wasn't that hard for Eren and Mikasa to take her down."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pmu69,"It looks like nobody said it so I will do it: Reiner only knows Levi as ""Levi"" but Porco calls him ""Ackermann"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,marina_kos,"After rewatching I noticed that some troops still have the blades (Mikasha, Sasha) while others didn't (Jean). So I guess some troops use both guns and swords. Also i wonder what is the use of the breast plate compartment thing. Generally I'd say i like the new design but I miss the capes. That's why Levi is the best of two worlds.

Everyone got extremely tall, even Connie which is a little jarring. They look cool but I don't really like Mikasha's design with the bangs and short hair. I think she looks too similar to Levi especially during fast action scenes.

I loved the episode and I can't wait for the next one."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MadGibby,Is it just me or is the eren vs warhammer theme/ost literally one of the best in the series? It's incredible
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uranthus,Not the drunk man from the last episode casually getting killed by a boulder üòÖ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vSmurk,"I don‚Äôt care what people say but I don‚Äôt think I can say I‚Äôm team eren. He killed children and civilians and didn‚Äôt show any sign of regret. Reiner even regretted what he had done to innocents. Loved the episode, but now I‚Äôm going to watch the show from a third party perspective, not rooting for either side but simply just watching how things turn out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Combat_Wombat23,Nitpick detail but I do miss Eren‚Äôs green eyes on his Titan. The CGI combined with the dead gray eyes seems like a design regression.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dumplingprincess,I‚Äôm interested in Armin‚Äôs role and his perspective on this whole situation. He‚Äôs always been the more non violent one of the trio
dumplingprincess,FlawlessCowboy94,Kind of ironic that the non violent dude is now a walking nuke lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TehPwndaz,levi vs zeke rematch please üò´üò´
TehPwndaz,International-Tree19,"The first one wasn't even a match, Zeke landed 0 punches on Levi."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ziimmerr,"Moments I audibly gasped...

- War Hammer Titan slashing through Eren
- The first ‚Äúziiiiip‚Äù of the maneuver gear
- Mikasa entering
- Levi entering
- Jaw Titan so close to killing Eren"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kallan401,This is the biggest example of what comes around goes around. They turned countless Eldians into mindless titans which wandered to paradis. Which made paradis end up specializing in anti-titan warfare. Porko‚Äôs surprise reaction to the scouts coming at him fearless and with the intent to kill pretty much sums it up.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Adam_Absence,"Man, these episodes keep getting shorter. This one was about 3 minutes right???"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,w8watm8,"Man ... devils of paradise's entry was so fucking epic. Levi at the end gave me Demon Slayer episode 19 kind of goose bumps. 

Just a bit bummed thinking nothing will come out of this fight since there are 10 more episodes. The epic level of this episode was on point with a season ending fight for any other anime. If they top this in the upcoming episodes hands down it will be a better season than 3.5 and will take the Best Anime Ever title with no competition (Not like they didn't already have it with Levi's moves from 3.5). 

Let's see what happens, hope I won't be disappointed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meanteenbirder,"Surprised that despite all the criticism of the CGI, this episode is still a 9.9/10 and the #17 higher rated TV episode on IMDB."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainSmeg,"How can something be this hype in 6 episodes? How do they keep reaching new heights every week?! 

Also I have a feeling Gabi is killing someone next week :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kkkbbb11523,Warhammers design is soooo fuckinf cool
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eesayas,You get what you deserve. Marley should've left Paradis alone.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,omohami,"Honestly! In this case I think Eren is completely justified in his attack no matter the Marley casualties. This is probably nothing compared to the years worth of lives lost on Paradise. You get what you give and Marley has definitely been asking for this ass whooping for awhile now. It‚Äôs like assaulting someone and then getting mad when they retaliate. Like, what did you think was gonna happen??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,team_suba,"I have to say, the last two episodes have been absolutely flooring. They set this thing up for 4.5 seasons and this payoff has just lived up to everything. I am so impressed by this season."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hypocrites_begone,Everyone being mad at Eren for killing a couple civilians due to collateral damage. Did you guys forget what Eren was going through? Or what Marley was planning to do? This is the good of the evils. Not to mention if killing a bunch of civs make you evil USA must be the devil on earth.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MagicThoughts,Yoooooo what the fuck happened to Mikasa's face though. She looks so manly.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mc-tarheel,"Potentially unpopular opinion:

I see very little wrong with what Eren did. This is war and Marley struck first when they sent the warrior candidates to Paradis. It's like (Game of Thrones reference) when Dany burned down King's Landing. Is it right? No. But is it war? Yes. The Paradis Eldians aren't doing anything they haven't been subjected to. If Marley miscalculated their enemy, that's their fault and problem."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GWillHunting,"I see a lot of people saying this is the best episode of the season. Hiw about possibly the best episode ever?

At least in my top 3 attack on Titan episodes of all time. War hammer titan? Mikasa saving Eren out of nowhere then fighting war hammer Titan one on one!?! Eren realizing the nape, then LEVI COMING IN OUTTA NOWHERE to slice the Jaw Titan!?!? 

The only other episode I can think of that can compete with this one is when it‚Äôs Levi vs the Beast Titan. 

Unbelievable episode. This show really is the greatest anime show of all time, really on Avatars level and beyond"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flamingoboon,Is anyone else disappointed by the new look of Mikasa...? Her head seemed too small for her body...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,datkidjz,The catastrophes caused by Eren ignited Gabi's newfound rage. Just like the catastrophes caused by Reiner on Paradis Island that made Eren seek revenge. Eren created another Eren.
datkidjz,OGFN_Jack,"That‚Äôs a fair point, but Gabi was ready to go to Paradis and slaughter both innocent and deserving people far before this attack. The main reason Erin wanted to join the scouts before the original titan attack was that he just wanted to see the world."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yaboinigel,"I can already feel like some people will say this is just as bad as opm season2

But the animation is just soo good even when its not on wits level from last season

Now i make myself sad"
seven_worth,callmehalleluja,ohhh her being a weapon creator for the other titans makes so much sense - now i wanna see eren fighting with a weapon
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RainingDeadBodies,I‚Äôm hyped up! One more minute until I can watch it!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Grip-Window,Why‚Äôd they have to end the episode like that
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brainvas,"this was fucking bonkers. I love how badass they all are. Eren is so fucking badass and tactical, i love this side of him. I also love the pure terror and disbelief in pockos eyes as he sees humanity from behind the walls coming full speed at him, not knowing this is what they had to fight for 100 years. Somehow i love how sasha looks the most. that stare in her eyes as she killed those guards.  
damn you aot, officially best anime"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,youthanasias,Bruh HOLY SHIT what an episode üò≥üò≥
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dualitysl,"The music is phenomenal. The introductions, everything. This is the best thing I have ever seen."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hypesword,"my eyes were just glued to the screen the entire episode.
Also Mikasa's 'come home' was really interesting. I'm guessing this is the start of a character arc, of her losing faith in Eren"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lightningpresto,Udo? More like UDEAD
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bearaucracy,"Guys what's the manga chapter to read after this episode??

This shit is too fking short and I need to know everything incase I die tomorrow..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AMK2201,"Noooooooo I thought there was more but then it ended. Nooooooo. Why do they have to do this lol. 

This episode was brilliant. Really great seeing the older Paradis people and how they've grown tactically.

I loved Mikasa and Levi's returns. Both were meaningful and epic.

I felt bad that Zofia and Udo had to die. But lots of kids died in Paradis when it was attacked. It's unfortunate but casualties like this are gonna happen during war.

Really can't wait for the next episode!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dionsp32,"I was confused why the warhammer titan didn't try to eat eren but I have 2 theories

The warhammer titan probably didn't eat eren because it couldn't get his power through the cable.

Another theory is the tyburs have royal blood and maybe the eldian king would take control?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MDFireBake,AOT will be remembered as one of the best series not only in anime but in general. what a time!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dabyss9908,"Both sides seem evil now. 

Just that I love the Paradis evil coz they are lit. And they were minding their own business.

Why does Paradis remind me of Israel wars? Like when they pre-empt an attack against the Arab nations?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ChasingEmbers,"I loved how the connotation of ‚Äúthe devils of paradis‚Äù changed from before and during the attack. It went from looking down on them to when Jaw is asking himself, ‚ÄúAre these the devils of paradis?‚Äù 

That was so cool, them causing all of that damage and doing something the mainland people have never seen: people actively going *towards* a titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RoccoSteal,I love how Levi‚Äôs presence anywhere is literally every opponents fear. They just know they‚Äôre already dead.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ScarletHighlander,"Season 1: ‚ÄúOh shit the titans are so powerful they don‚Äôt have any weaknesses we‚Äôre doomed‚Äù

Season 4: ‚Äúhaha egg in ground‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"already got a few things I can‚Äôt wait to discuss on the podcast:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Willy knew something was up and that he was likely gonna die. Explains his emotion last episode.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Magath also had a heads up and was prepared to retaliate

‚Ä¢	‚Å†a big one: EREN DID THIS WITHOUT DIRECT COORDINATION WITH THE SCOUTS? he is surprised mikasa and crew showed up. How long has he been under cover? Has he disobeyed orders?


‚Ä¢	‚Å†the mikasa and Levi arrivals were amazingly timed and cinematic.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†cliffhangers on cliffhangers. Man. I want to hear what Levi has to say about erens actions -  if everyone gets out of this alive...

‚Ä¢	‚Å†lastly, I hate to say this, because I have refused to complain so far, BUT... I finally get that the titan CG was a little clunky, specifically in this episode, mostly Erens. Still shots were great, but the more we saw his whole body moving, the more jarring it was.

Just my early thoughts, but wow, what a great episode. I can‚Äôt wait for next week. Will discuss a whole breakdown and theories (were anime only) on the podcast dropping Wednesday. Link in my Profile."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stancinovici,"Damn, Sasha got hot af."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Grayox,"The 3D maneuvering gear looks like its evolved a few generations during the time skip, cant wait to see how the general army is equipped. Paradis Island has been breading a military culture for years that the Marleyian Empire couldnt take seriously from the mouth of their child Warriors. The hype for this season is so high and it keeps building into stoke overload, its gonna be a long week."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,valarrazor,This episode has made my hands go numb from the excitement and the terrifying knowledge that no one is safe anymore. Anyone can die. E X H I L A R A T I N G.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SecondRealitySims,"The group is clearly divided over Eren‚Äôs actions. Like how Eren is glad that Mikasa came, and some believe everyone in Marley is the enemy and that even civilians are targets. That‚Äôs probably why Armin isn‚Äôt there. I doubt he‚Äôd have the stomach to join Eren, and the destructive power of the Colossal in a city would probably kill thousands. Which Eren may be fine with? But Armin definitely wouldn‚Äôt be."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jaggysnake3,"No one's mentioned the lights from what I can see, what's all that about?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Visual_Eve,Lmao that belly flop Eren did on the Marlayen Army
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,callmehalleluja,lol gabi asking herself why this is happening to her like girl u fight for the most oppressive nation in the world and now u are surprised that maybe some people don't like u - nevertheless great episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Two_Watermelons,"""Don't they realize i'm a titan? They're just humans... and they're coming to attack me?!"" 

I could literally feel his terror.  My heart is still racing from that ending scene."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeepFizzle24,"When mikasa showed and the classic music started, I didn't stop smiling until the episode ended"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DemonicLemon02,"Eren seems like a level headed, dead inside but also a fucking nutter. He was so unphased about getting his titan head lopped off, maybe because he had faith in Mikasa? It was also as if Eren was sending out letters but not receiving them so they mustn't of had much coordination shown by Mikasas question to Eren. 

Earlier today I was literally thinking ""I actually really like Zofia"" then she dies üò≠. I dont really like udo too much but his death was equally if not more tragic, sorta had me feeling sick"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aliiirsss,"Guys, the CGI saved time and it wasn't bad. They imo did a good job. Not worth harassing the studio about. I've seen worse CGI for sure."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,profishkeeping,"I honestly felt sad seeing what all the marleyans went through, the guards for example- they seemed like nice people. Im trying to have a neutral approach to the situation but it just seems so damn obvious that the eldians are going to win- I mean as porco said, the Survey corps just aren't scared of his titan like the soldiers they fought on the first episode. Although they are both trying their hardest to win, the survey corps have been trained ruthlessly since day one fighting arm in arms against their oppressor, whereas the marleyan soldiers have been treated like dirt, serving as slaves under the oppressor- which explains the vast difference in strength."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AMK2201,Bruh in the next episode I expect Armin gonna clean house like Kane in his prime during the WWF days just coming out of nowhere and taking down 20 WWF superstars.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Captain-Aizen,Connie got hot!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dashboardrage,what the fuck did I just watch this is a damn masterpiece
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,slayerboi,"holy shit that was amazing. The Mikasa reveal was epic, and Levi's entrance just topped it off. It all was so damn unexpected, my heart jumped in joy! They all look so much cooler. Can't wait for next week, so hypedd!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UrAniMaTiX,Sasha didn't kill Gabi. this decision will probably come to bite them back later on
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ellieetsch,IMO if 90% of the world is going to declare war to exterminate your people you have the right to fight back by any means necessary. You heard the people cheering when Willy was making his speech. There was no talking their way out of it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,66nations,"That scene of Levi posing as the jaw Titan was lurking...so cool. (Missed it the first time round)

The build-up throughout is just epic!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chimicu,"Nice episode! Finally some 3D flying! I don't get why Porco was surprised by the scouts' attack, he should have Ymir memories, she trained and fought titans as a scout.."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nocturnal_tarantula,Will be rewatching this one everyday till the next episode drops.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zernos_Park,"The animation for this episode was heavily reliant on 3D cgi not only on the titans, but also on the paradis soldiers as well. I think to a certain extent usage of 3D is fine but I am used to the incredibly smooth and detailed 2D animation of the previous seasons done by Wit studio. I don't like the studio change so far. The 3D really bothers me as it's such a downgrade in terms of animation quality especially during action sequences."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shinpachix,"Wait imagine this episode is the first episode of aot then eren and friends would be the villains.

I loved the hammer titan, can‚Äôt wait for reigner and zeke! 

I cried when udo died"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Miserable_Contest_48,"‚ÄúDo it now, Mikasa‚Äù HELL YEAAAAAAAAA"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cdntrooper19,Wow the levi part was amazing he still looks the same and a badass
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shadowdragon2200," this was one of the few anime that got me into full fanboi, this episode was amazing and i am very much so looking forward to the next episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IroncladDiplomat,Am I supposed to feel any sympathy for the Marleyans? Because I don't. I hope Eren fucks all their shit up including Gabi and all the Eldians fighting for Marley. Complete annihilation.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,norad1991,"Ending to that episode really pumped me up. 

"" I am a titan and they are coming to kill me""

Fuck yeah they are mwhahahaha. Phwoorrrrrr."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditer51,"Eren killed innocent children. People caught in the crossfire. People not unlike himself and his family way back when. People like him and his mother.

Sasha - freakin potato girl - killed a man.

Its just shocking. I mean, fuck the people that were racist towards the eldians and actively killing them, I don't have sympathy for them, but still.

Man, I dont know what to feel. This show does moral ambiguity better than any other anime I've seen"
Redditer51,hrdp453,"Cannot compare the two. Marley is planning on war against Paradis. It's even training kids like Gabi, Udo etc. to be mass murderers of men, women and children alike. Eren and co. on the other hand just wanted to see the world outside the walls when they were attacked."
hrdp453,Redditer51,"True. Plus I still remember Gabi committing a war crime in episode 1.

I guess I was more so thinking the innocent children that had nothing to do with all of Marley's bullshit.

I do think with certain characters the show does a really good job showing how easy it is to convince yourself that your side is good and the other side is evil (Gabi and her friends), and how thats a big part of real life wars. In some ways I feel sorry for them, because they're essentially kids who've been brainwashed into committing atrocities against their own people."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sadbosniantime,Everyone on here arguing about erens choices being moral or not while im over here being a heterosexual male and thinking holy fuck eren is so sexy with the way hes calm and calculated about everything he does now 0.0 like holy shit man he took a second to read the situation follow the line from the warhammer titan and deduce that the body is under the stage. Fuckkkkk bro old eren wouldnt do that hes just keep rampaging until he was tired its so fucking sickkkkk
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Energeticsmw,I feel like we missed so much between season 3 and 4 and Mikasa looks kinda weird but overall love it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yassiiine,Why is Eren's Titan left EYE white ?
yassiiine,Mr-Rocafella,"Same one he had bandaged so it could be intentional, or representative of something beyond our comprehension at this time"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,schleddit,Fucking great episode!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IITomTheBombII,"I can't wait to learn what Paradis's/The Scouts long term strategy is.  Like Magath said, the entire world will be against them now.

The parallel between Bertholt/Reiner attacking the walls and killing civilians and Eren attacking Marley is very interesting, I hope we learn more about the time loop that was mentioned by Eren Kruger at the end of season 3.  Is it a literal time loop, or more of a theoretical 'Oh we'll just keep attacking each other's civilizations with titans every few decades' kind of thing.

Eren's motivations are still very unclear, it seems like he may be being influenced by past holders of the Attack Titan and Founding Titan to some extent."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pandaoso54,"Anyone else think that Sasha killing those two soldiers in front of Gabi brings it full circle to Eren watching his mother be eaten in front of him? For me, watching Gabi's eyes and determination grow as more and more people die around her makes me think how she will not stop, like Eren, until every last enemy is dead."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uhohbrando,Not me thinking Eren was gunna do something peaceful and diplomatic with his presence at the announcement omgg
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,"Another point to show that this episode is a repeat of the very first episode both the king of walls and the Marley military knew that an attack was coming but did nothing to stop it.

Even though Eren pulled all this shit I  still don't like Marley more now, for me 4 episodes weren't enough to feel enough sympathy to root for them, comparing it to what Eren and co had to go through.
I agree what Eren did was probably wrong but Magath knew what was gonna happen but did nothing, they're equally at fault.

I'd love to see the warrior's reaction if they find out that Magath knew about the attack"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mechaheph,"So it seems the Warhammer Titan is probably the best bet for what the Founding Titan used to help refine walls, create bridges, cities, other structures. We are seeing it make things like spire/nail, warhammer, crossbow, but it could also be using that crystalization power to make bridges and buildings. Lends a lot of credibility that Grisha thinks that the ancient Eldians used the titans in a semi-peacful way to help build civilization, not just destroy it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,spyke333,Anyone else feel that Gabi is going to kill one or a few of the Paradis forces? Auxiliary characters or maybe even one of the main ...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Blackscure,Bro i thought the warhammer would be some crazy sht but literally just got unplugged. Probably the worst weak point
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PupLover14,Damn... So confused...
PupLover14,chipthehippie,"Uhh, why? Everything is spelled out in the episode."
PupLover14,fist_my_muff2,Why?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Maame_lade,"I realised a few things and I'm not sure if I'm just painfully unaware of how life works or if I'm the philosopher of the century. Nevertheless, I thought I'd share.

First, I'm crying because I just realised we'll never again see the happy-go-lucky cast we all love so much. Those 15 year olds who made jokes and smiled at each other are gone. From here on out were going to see adults weighed down by the blood of thousands, all to aware that they have no right to be happy. 

Secondly, I'm honestly glad that they're getting their revenge but they're ultimately proving the Marleyans right by doing so. They no longer have the chance to say ""you were wrong about us"" and they've truly chosen to become the devils they were portrayed as for decades.

I've managed to avoid spoilers so far so believe me when I say I genuinely don't know who will die, but when they do, it's likely that they wont feel fear as the people in the previous seasons did, but rather see their deaths as an atonement for their sins. 




I'm still team Eren though „ÉΩ(Àá„ÉòÀá)„Éé"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nazzariox,We need a colossal vs beast battle. Long hands swatting around in slo mo.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShikaTheApache,"Levi as usual made one hell of a badass entrance and saved Eren for the 10302010th time. Eren's move by attacking the stage seemed rushed to me and looked like it wasn't part of the plan, but he knew he would be saved which makes me wonder if he can see the future as well and not just the past."
ShikaTheApache,Kaioken64,"It's implied they can see the future since the guy who was speaking to grisha on the top of the wall where they kick eldians off and turn them into titans said something along the line of 'save armin and mikasa' in like season 2 or 3. 

That was before eren and his friends were even born."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SmileyFresca,"**AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa**

&#x200B;

I rest my case. That's all I have to say. Great episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seraiss,"7/5  yes thats my mark 
This episode is insane so much happened, also I love how marley was sending titans at paradis to kill em and now they have just insane anti titan warfare and that's not all it can be used as anti personal just look how they destroyed that convoy?of troops in cars using thunder spears and also just odd gear as itself is deadly ."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nearby-County7333,i screamed practically every minute of the episode especially when the scouts came in i could not stop squealing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fslaloo,One of the best episode couldn‚Äôt stop screaming
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xalara24,"Jesus Christ what the fuck is this, Eren goes to eat the Warhammer titan im HYPE 'DO IT ERENNNN'' then Porco Apears with his Titan to almost oneshot Eren scaring the crap out of me only for LEVI TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE and ''save the day'' BUT THEN PORCO IS ON THE VERGE OF GETTING SHIT ON BY EVERYONE WITH A 3D MANUEVER GEAR, I CAN'T FUCKING CHEER FOR ANYONE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HIS OPOSITION."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YamFor,I‚Äôve already watched it twice
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thekrustycrusher,"Really enjoyed this episode. It‚Äôs a good parallel to what it was like when Reiner and Bert first appeared. Really sells to you how this is all about perspectives and that there is really no right or wrong, and that this is all is part of that cycle of hatred and revenge."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,"God damn Jaw titan got dunked on so fucking hard. 

He and Zeke can compare Levi PTSD notes afterwards, if they survive."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hushpolocaps69,"Holy crap this was such a crazy episode, so much action took place and I was just absolutely crazed out by everything! 


Also... I wasn‚Äôt expecting the characters to look THAT different but I love how much older and mature they‚Äôve gotten. Sasha threw me off the most because she looks completely different, is serious, and has a completely different voice."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FrankSirracha,"Listen, I‚Äôm fine with some cgi in my shows but it‚Äôs a little too much in this episode, the Titans I‚Äôll give a pass on but they should not be using cgi for any of the humans it looks like poop"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mastermaze,"My brain is broken, like i think have literally second-hand ptsd from watching that episode. No one is a hero, no one is a villian, everyone is either dead, dying, or trying to kill as many ppl on the other side as possible. This is as close to a real war as I can imagine. This is the best show Ive ever seen in this genre (whatever the fuck genre this show is at this point). Thats it, idk what else, fucking speechless otherwise lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the_heff,I don‚Äôt like the way gabi was glaring at Sasha. I didn‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôd missed the ODM gear noise until this episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,I really feel like it‚Äôs about time Annie comes out of the crystal. Especially since they reminded us of that ability with the warhammer Titan. I also feel like Armin is back in Paradis maybe he will show up later. I can‚Äôt exactly picture him being too keen on the idea of killing civilians. Maybe he is with Annie‚Äôs crystalized body. I‚Äôd love it if he has just been helping her get readjusted this whole time.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,souaiway,OMGGGGGGG THAT EPISODE WAS SO GOOOOOOODDDDDDD AAAAAHHHHHHH . but also... is gabi about to turn into season 1 eren??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jznaveed,"I look the fact that even across an entire Ocean, in a completely different continent, Levi is still known and feared."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MopeqYT,"I'm curious what's gonna happen between Rainer and Eren, cuz they could become friends ngl"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ueharajohji,I just realized eren saved falco by making him stay in the underground (knowing reiner will protect the kid). Good guy elen

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,geraltofrivia2345," What's up with Commander Magath teleporting everywhere and having this extra thicc plot armor lol. He survived being bombed in the  rooftops by Thunder Spears near point blank, he survives another grenade  attack in their building, and suddenly being on the ground walking  somewhere lol.  Did anyone else feel this way?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AsiansArentReal,"So Eren seemed pretty confident in just eating that crystal? Does this mean they‚Äôve gotten through to Annie in the last 4 years? Whether that‚Äôs cracking her like an egg or eating her like an egg?

Also the cannons syncing up with the music? Pure perfection."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sahil2921,"eren in this episode be like
"" can i eat it?"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Canutethe_Great,Am I the only one who think that Mikasa's face looked a little fat in this episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,risk2798,Can we just address the situation where the studio has done Mikasa sooooo wrong!? She looks sooo different. I kind of mistook her for Levi at first!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamal3x_,Did anyone else get chills when they showed a pov shot of the scouts flying through the streets?! Also it was so satisfying seeing Porco piss himself because he had never faced survey corps. That Levi slice was clean af too. Amazing episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VlBE-CHECK,"Has anyone mentioned the parallels between this episode and the very first episode of season 1? Where Eren‚Äôs mother was crushed under the rock and he tried to save her but the commander carried him away to safety against his wishes? 

The same thing happened this episode with Gabby and her friend who was crushed. It really shows how Eren became the very thing he sought to destroy."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Samantha_H0918,"They did a fantastic job portraying the scouts as a threat as formidable as any titan(s) this episode. AoT always surprises - Eren's brain shined more than his brawn this episode too and the war hammer played much less of a role than expected. Could not stop replaying Porco's pure terror. For a Marleyan who is used to defending against long range cannons and tanks in war, it must be so shocking to see singular flying humans with the audacity to come close and take you out in an instant lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yumekira,Damn Zofia really just said ü¶µü¶µ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,baldeagle86,Can‚Äôt wait for Eren to make a shell of cover and Armin to nuclear explode the whole city

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frokiedude,"Banger episode. Im so happy the rest of the scouts disprove of Erens method. 

Didnt expect Floch lmao"
frokiedude,hrdp453,Kinda made sense. He was the sole survivor of that attack by the Beast Titan and saw so many friends be killed senselessly.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Razor-kun,"I also found it interesting how the diff societies advanced. The main land never had a titan problem, so their society advanced and made technology suited for war and killing people. Then just recalibrated certain things for titans. While the island society was busy creating odm gear specifically made to fight titans. While they were really far behind technology wise in every other case, I think the odm gear might be the most high tech item in the whole verse tbh."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uhohshesintrouble,"Question: why do you think commander Magath said ‚Äúremember, it was me who shot first‚Äù?!"
uhohshesintrouble,AMK2201,"So I had an idea...

Tybur and Magath discuss how Marley needs a new hero. Perhaps Magath taking the first shot is to show that he, a human, was the first to take a stand against the titans?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,willworkforabreak,"Yoooo, I gotta be honest. I think this might be my favorite season of the show. Condensing so many chapters down has led to an amazing level of pacing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dracob2099,Damn they change Mikasa into Mike lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lacking-name,"The Scouts look so badass!

Sasha! Conny! Jean! Butch Mikasa! Even Floch!

But most importantly, our boy Levi!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zachariusTM,"I let out a loud ""FUCK YOU SO HARD"" when the ""to be continued"" screen came up. 

What an awesome, awesome episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Toveza,"Am I the only one thinking about how does Porco now the Ackerman?
Like when Levi cuts his jaw he sees him and says, an Ackerman!"
Toveza,Pimvdh97,"I looked it up. And found an old reddit post (12months ago) saying that after their encounter with Levi (Levi v Zeke). Zeke was able to deduct that Levi was an Ackerman, based on his skills in fighting. So he probably told Porco"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Verano_Zombie,I got so excited watching this episode. I don't know why but I hope everything ends in utter mayhem.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pimvdh97,"The one question I have is:

Is Eren able to ""see"" the things they explained in S3? That neural pathway of some sorts? Does he see a 'greater good' or something? I refuse to believe he kills all those civilians out of retaliation."
Pimvdh97,Xalbana,It's been hinted that the Attack Titan has the ability to see to the future so Eren with possibly the Founding Titan was able to see something. His whole personality changed when he touched Historia at the end of Season 3 and he made that face/realization.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAMMIIRO,"I was screaming at the television. My God this was so good. Levi in for the save. 

Loved seeing the scouts charging the Titan head on and they couldn‚Äôt understand it.  They were used to fighting enemies from far away not up close and personal."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mythraven72,"I suspect Armin is with Zeke, threatening him if he turns Titan, Armin will turn colossal which is pretty much setting off a nuke."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,johoneil,the thing that I realized is so ironic about the Marleyans is that they been giving the people of Paradis decades of training in fighting the very thing Marley uses in war.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditer51,"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain: the episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditer51,"I gotta say, I am all for sexy tomboy Mikasa."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KEYBOARDSMASHERJ,"I remember the general saying to call the troops receiving special training in the mountains. I wonder if this group is practicing with Marley‚Äôs version of ODM gear? 


If so, I wonder if it‚Äôll be worse or better than the Island‚Äôs."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eddyyd,"I just realized all the episodes were on Hulu 4 hrs ago and now I‚Äôm caught up....

This episode!!!! Levi!!! Cart titan‚Äôs (forgot her name) fear when she saw the ‚Äúdevils‚Äù flying on the roof!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BurnStar4,"Okay so I'm LOVING this so far. My only gripe is with the animation. The overall new style I'm absolutely fine with, but I'm not so keen on the sort of semi-CGI bits here and there? I get that it makes 3D stuff look better like when the Titans are fighting but I think I would prefer the 2D style on them still. In the trailer for this season we see War Hammer and Eren fighting but they look more like drawings and not CGI. Much prefer that.

That's literally it though, aside from that I'm fucking loving this season. Can't wait to see how it ends!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StephDude008,"IDK why we are all entertaining the idea that the sus soldier was anybody other than Armin. Like, it was definitely him and that's why he wasn't in this most recent ep. The only reason that I can think of is that it is true and manga readers don't want to 'spoil' it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ferentas,"I feel like how desperate and weak Marleyan military is against the Eldians is very similar to Eldian‚Äôs being weak against the titans at the start of all this. In the first season, nobody (including soldiers) could fight titans except a few scouts that survived them before. Now in Marley, noone can fight against Eldians except ones who knew about them before. I bet armor, beast, and cart titans will be the only ones that can fight in the next episode, just like scouts. Also scouts being able to attack titans without hesitation is the perfect example of what doesn‚Äôt kill will make you stronger. It‚Äôs just perfect to see how roles have changed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ElectricalMadness,"Porco has never been afraid of anything a day in his life because people are always afraid of him. But Paradis has been fighting creatures like him, out numbered 100 to 1, for decades."

For the rest, great episode!"
aglio99,Reader575,">Is it only me who found the hammer titan kinda weak?

If it wasn't for Misaka, Eren would be dead. I think that's the point of the War Hammer titan, it's supposed to be a glass canon"
Reader575,CowboyBebopCrew,"I agree. The War Hammer bodied Eren, and would‚Äôve killed him had Mikasa not intervened. I was impressed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,as122000,"If the Eldians are being treated so poorly by Marley, and they have the power of the Titans, why don‚Äôt they rise up against Marley?

I can understand that they might think that it‚Äôs bad to rise up and all but they have many of the ‚Äúnine‚Äù titans already, they could probably use the power to take over the city or at the least demand equality?

What am I missing here?"
as122000,Raknel,"> they could probably use the power to take over the city 

They probably could take over Liberio, but Marley isn't a city. It's a multi-continental empire of presumably tens, maybe hundreds of millions of people of which Eldians make up a rather small percentage overall. Even with titan powers that wouldn't be possible, they needed 4 titans + the titan bombardment just to take a fort at the start of season 4.

And if they started a civil war, the rest of the world would just swoop in to wipe out both Marleyans and Eldians while they are weakened. Ironically enough they need each other to survive."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,soozyYT,"I got chills from that episode that was insane! 
To be fair, I really was hoping to see Zekes reaction to Eren. And I can‚Äôt wait to see Armin again. He seemed so frightened and scared in s3, can‚Äôt wait to see how much he‚Äôs matured overall"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,packistanfield,Armin im pretty sure is the undercover soldier who trapped the jaw and quad titans
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Havic13,Anyone else thought the cgi was a little bad
Havic13,Eggishtrain,Yup. Jean was CGI too in at least one scene. It was the one where he pulled the gut backwards with the ODM gear.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,7thGalaxy,They're using CGI for the fight scenes -_-
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Basc63,I feel like it would‚Äôve been much easier for them to bring armin and nuke the place
Basc63,hrdp453,That would've killed the Warhammer titan among others. They need Eren to eat it right?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,toligjoni77,Great episode. The only complaint i have is that they use CGI waaaay too much. Nearly all Titan combat is CGI.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Obeesuchiha,"Why all titans CGI?? With wit only the collosal was CGI, here with mappa every single titan is CGI. It's visually ugly and puts me off man."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StaleToasts,"I liked everything about the episode except for the CGI, a little bit too much of it being used IMO."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sansaofhousestark99,"Might sound like a full blown hater.

But where was the very insanely epic music and absolutely GORGEOUS animated scenes that played in action scenes from S1-S3?

The fight wasn't lackluster, I know that much. But it did miss the spark that left me watching AOT. 

All scenes of Mikasa and Levi in their ODM gear usually left my jaw dropped. There wasn't any of that in this episode. I'm confused. This is the same studio that's making Jujutsu Kaisen. So I was hyped as fuck that they were the ones animating this season. But I'm confused and a tiny bit disappointed. 

TL;DR: I miss the soundtrack and animation from the first 3 seasons that should have 100% been present here."
sansaofhousestark99,GroundbreakingSort32,You‚Äôre totally warranted man the animation really sucks it took away from the episode a lot for me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlinBlobian376,I‚Äôm not angry just disappointed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Grandwhish,The cg looks like stop motion dolls
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KeishDaddy,"I might be out of the loop, but why does all the criticism of the CGI read like everyone here is walking on egg shells? Is this a sensitive topic?

I personally think it looks awful."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pyromufin24,"Mikasa looks different, and the CGI is kinda off-putting, but it's still awesome. Otherwise, that episode was absolutely incredible"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eamontothat,"Why is so much CGI being used for the Titans and the scouts, it honestly looks god awful and I just can‚Äôt get behind it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nxckg04,"Imma start off by saying that I honestly hate how the characters looked with the new art style. I loved the fighting and the reasoning behind the fighting, but this isn‚Äôt like Eren and the rest of everyone to do this. Again, this is Eren continuing his mission just like Reiner was. I just have a lot to say on this episodeüòÇ"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Terrible_Child,"I gotta say, having read the manga recently, I thought this episode would have been better animated than that. The 3D was great, but the 2D is definitely lacking. I felt like the War Hammer weapon formation in the trailer was way more impressive than in the show. The scene where Eren body slams the crowd felt way less pronounced, and his improved crystal knuckle formation couldn't even be appreciated properly. In the manga, you could see how Eren has learned to stretch the formation all the all the way past the wrists.

But moreso than the animation is the actual directing itself, the cuts, pacing, the time spent on certain shots. It's not ***awful****,* but it's definitely underwhelming.

Compare the Warhammer Titan fight with Levi v. Beast Titan fight, and you'll see the gulf of difference in tightness, pacing, and integration with music, which I also thought was poorly done. It felt like they just threw the soundtrack over the visuals without accounting for crescendos. Also, the sound of Eren's crystalized knuckles pounding on the War Hammer Titan was so *weak and flimsy*."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nyarlathotepisyummy,"JesusfuckingChrist. I was crying during the entire episode; it was overwhelming. After years and years of despair, failure, and loss, they have now embraced how the world sees them‚Äî that they are truly the devils."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yourdadisme5,"I honestly just recently learned that the studios have been changed, because I can clearly see the difference. In my honest opinion, the style of the studio that animated the seasons before this a lot better. They made attack on titan what it is for me. It wasn't just another anime, it was so, so, so, gorgeous looking.
I'm not saying this is bad, I really enjoyed this episode and appreciate the animators. I can just imagine Eren's fighting and looking better. I'd give this episode an 7.5/10."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tisco04,That was amazing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fueledbymelancholy,The Scouts changed the outfits from old school cyberpunk soldiers into special ops agent suits.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dchunster,Why couldn‚Äôt Porco bite through Erin? What did Levi slash?
Dchunster,GroundbreakingSort32,His jaw muscle
GroundbreakingSort32,verticaluzi,Neutralised his entire ability in seconds
Dchunster,jukeboxx17,"He slashed the Jaw Titan‚Äôs...well, his jaw"
jukeboxx17,Dchunster,Alright now I feel dumb haha but that makes sense
Dchunster,SekaiQliphoth,He slashed his cheek muscle that closes your jaw.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noctiszaoldyeck,"Eren kinda Reminds me of Daenerys from Game of thrones in the series, and Mikasa was like Jon snow reminding Eren he killed civilians and children...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was so epic"
noctiszaoldyeck,MyWatchlsEnded,Lets hope thats the only similarity this season has with GOT season 8. Don't want to see another show die like that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JBau9,Honestly the Tyburs are evil for making this the only viable time for Paradise to attack. You have all the war generals and war hammer titan in one place. They put it in the internment camp knowing they would be attacked. Marley knowingly killed everyone for the sake of their country. Eren did what he needed to in order to save his friends and people.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tyrod1234,Why tf this had me screaming the whole episode üò≠ crews back
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ikildedmemes,"Was I the only one confused with the Warhammer Titan transforming underground? Didnt they just show her standing outside, right before she transformed. Pls explain."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cooljoe22,Bro I can‚Äôt rn. I‚Äôm speechless and overstimulated at the same time. God
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,imnotgayyet,Love how the Titans fear humans now and see them as monsters
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mctravie,I had a lot of assassins creed and spider man vibes from this episode and love the new upgrades they got
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lightningpresto,"Mikasa said the same line as Levi ‚ÄúDo you have any idea what you‚Äôve done?‚Äù Line was spoken when Mikasa and Eren challenges Levi because they wanted to revive Armin.

Mikasa saying this to Eren makes it appear they‚Äôre no longer on the same page anymore"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,glizzysam,"y'all remember the scene in the trailer where the collosal titan was flipping boats, that might be relevant here"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skrival,"Me watching the jaw titan going tyk bite erens nape: ""after 3 seasons Eren still doesn't know how not to get captures...ffs"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jtsane,"Okay don‚Äôt get me wrong, this episode was great, but does anyone else think the action this season seems almost slower? Maybe this is just me, but it feels a little off."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DGT-exe,"most of the cgi was pretty good, except for a few odd shots here and there. dont see much to complain about when they still have that weightiness and impact.

levi and the first return of the scouts had me and the homies SCREAMING"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BAREFOOTPigs,"What Magath said has kinda scared me tho. Kool they're gonna win this battle(I think, but am not too sure bc in the ep 7 preview it looked like shit was going downnn with the Warriors coming thru), but what will happen when the entire world attacks them?


Also, the Armin reveal is gonna be hype asf I feel like"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jimxyoonique,No idea why people are complaining about the CGI when they're watching a masterpiece in the making. This episode was historic.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ttheressaa,i actually liked the cgi in this ep it made everything feel more eerie and weirdly lifelike. cgi is growing on me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,I loved how Porco just couldn‚Äôt wrap his head around the face that the scouts were trying to kill him. Dude has no idea there are soldiers who specialize in killing Titans.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mershiful,"I literally screamed when Mikasa came through and the scouts rolled in holy fUCK! what an absolute banger this episode was! hearing the 3D manoeuvre gear and seeing old faces, taking in all the action! this was a top notch episode! I was hyped for this episode and I‚Äôm hyped as fUCK to see the next! gonna go rewatch this episode right now >:)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,InstantNoodlesIsHot,Dying drunk isn't so bad I guess [lol](https://i.imgur.com/NR7O36e.png)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stando_powah,"I really wish the animation was as good as studio wits, they use to work some magic with the scouts flying around specially Levi, this studio is relying too much on 3d and it‚Äôs janky at that"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,L337Fool,Dayummmm! That was amazing. Couldn't help but to cheer the old team on because of all the shit the Marleyans and their Eldian pets put them through. They are why they are so strong. Fantastic episode!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,soupmachine_,By the end of this war the Marleyans are gonna have PTSD from hearing the ODM gear
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ToAsTyBoI-_-,Does anyone else think the war hammer titan is extremely disturbing
ToAsTyBoI-_-,Jaaawsh,I thought the umbilical cord was gross. But other than that I thought the design of the titan itself was actually pretty awesome.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ApacheFYC,notice how levi was the only one still wearing the old survey corp gear
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thesquishydumpling,This was one of those episodes where my jaw literally dropped every 2 minutes and I involuntary yelped in excitement when the OG squad pulled up.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brokenearth10,wow what happened to mikasa!!! she looks awful
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrMxylptlyk,"Why did the squad switch to this model of odm/pistols? Didn't they discover a fatal flaw in it last season?! Once the rope is engaged, they can't shoot!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cojovoncoolio,Gabi reminds me so much of Eren it's scary too. She's way more skilled then Eren was though at her age which leads me to believe she's gonna be one scary adult if she survives all of this
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FreshValentine,So no one happy to see Sasha?!! Haha
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cgoodies5,"I was feeling slightly underwhelmed after the first two episodes of this season, a four year time jump and introduction of new characters, but now I really appreciate the effort to show the other side of the conflict. Super love the scene with Reiner and eren talking about why they both thought they were doing whatever they thought was right to save the world. Eren seems like a new person now, the growth is palpable."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,woahysenia,Damn just watching this episode this final season gonna be badass
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,youcancallmejb,"This show does a fantastic job of capturing the horrors of war.... people dying left and right, and unceremoniously to say the least... (poor udo and zofia)

I‚Äôll add to the ‚Äúwtf is Eren doing?!‚Äù dialogue by saying I totally agree with the idea that he‚Äôs seen more than enough of the future to know what he‚Äôs starting, and what it will ultimately lead to. He‚Äôs definitely flying solo, I imagine the letters were either personal, or explaining his plan, and hoping Mikasa and gang would support him in some way.

He just seems too calculating and calm throughout this whole exchange to NOT be in control."
youcancallmejb,cgoodies5,"Excellent point about his foresight. The morality of what eren did, still unclear if he was acting separate from the scouts/paradis, but either way it seems clear he felt a preemptive strike was necessary. To me, it seems like this was all about the war hammer titan, drawing it out, to level the playing field even more for paradis"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cgoodies5,"Since Zeke has royal blood in him, does that mean by touching him in titan form eren with be able to control the pure titans????"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crash18867,"That. Was. The. Best. 24. Minutes. Of. Anime. I. Have. Ever. Watched. Period.

HOLY SHIT THAT WAS AMAZING"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainGamer008,The episode was pretty good but the animation threw me off. It was all just weird CGI and was clunky as hell. The rest was pretty good tho.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,monkey_D_v1199,"Is it bad that I‚Äôm rooting for Eren and the rest of the corps? Damn everyone got so strong, the power of a time skip aren‚Äôt for nothing! MAPPA did a wonderful job with the fights. Didn‚Äôt mind the CGI, it blended really well and the transitions from CGI to 2D weren‚Äôt jawing at all. Favorite part was definitely when the corps starting to gang up on Porco. Loved how he was in shock seeing humans come at him like nothing. They been doing that for years to survive so it‚Äôs second nature now. I don‚Äôt blame Porco for it, I would too if Levi came out of nowhere and nearly incapacitated me. Can‚Äôt wait for episode 7!!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainMin,I thought the cg looked okay.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hope_Esketit,Anyone else going to talk about how 19yr versions look super odd compared to 15yr versions? They look 30-40 to me for some reason.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sam_moisture,"I really am hoping for a movie finale now more than ever. Some CG looked good(like the 3DMG scenes) and some looked really bad I‚Äôm not gonna lie. The animators are going great with what time they‚Äôre working with. I really just blame the higher ups I guess and I think this anime needed like 4 more months of time maybe. Still, this is a good adaption. I really think attack on titan deserves its best for it‚Äôs finale tho. 8.5/10 for the ep. Any thoughts?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jb07037t,Why is porco surprised at Levi & crew when he has Ymir memories?
jb07037t,Banana_Swagg3r,Being cocky usually has that effect on people.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Banana_Swagg3r,"This shows how un informed this Porko kid is. 4 years hanging around with Peek, Reiner and Zeke. Yet he is clueless on how determined and deadly their enemies are. No wonder he is always wearing that cocky face."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,turbokat123,"Prior to all the controversial plot point revelations related to intentions of characters shown through conversations and actions, 
I really need validation that i wasn't the only one shrieking like a child throughout the episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheGruffaloDick,Levi coming from the blue to wreck the Jaw titan probably saving Eren literally had my jaw open that was so sick!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSpartanLemon,Is Season 4 still confirmed to have 16 episodes?  Or is that old/fake news?
TheSpartanLemon,44gonfaloniere,"I'm sure we are getting a second part for the season.
the manga hasn't even finished"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TTiger901,Imma just say... where the Monke titan at?
TTiger901,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,"He comin
But he is probably shitting himself, his last memory of battling the scouts was Levi with a sword in his mouth"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CommunityCancer,"The new ep was amazing...  But one moment stood out...   Sasha killing those 2 soldiers in front of Gabi...   this moment hold so much significance. They are all ready to kill every soldier but their intentions end there they don't want any innocent dying, Sasha could have killed Gabi but since Gabi is small she figured that she is a civilian. Even mikasa and jean share the sentiment but Eren on the other hand he is killing innocents left right and center, This really shows that eren is truly not taking any sides here."
CommunityCancer,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,"Eren wasn't killing innocents, his rampage just had some civilian casualties. He was killing those journalists and representatives of other countries"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Loknook,"I dont know what Erin and co are doing attacking a civilian populace like they are. It seems Erin is somewhat out for revenge and that the group is divided in thought. I'm sure there is something deeper going in on here and Armin is definitely up to something, posing as a regular soldier. No matter what I wonder if this action is sactioned by Queen historia or is Erin is still acting on impulse."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,benjo300,If i want to start reading the Manga after watching the 6th episode where should I start ?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Adventurous_Match_64,"Bruh watching the last 5 minutes of this episode had me like

Me: YOOOO GET EM GET EM GET EM!!!!!

The episode: to be continued

Me: NO NOOO NOOOO NOOOOOOO"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JimMoriarty1905,"""Is that Ackerman?"" 
Heck yeah it is! Who else makes such grand entrances? ;)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mewmiuww,Why was this episode only like 10 minutes long üò≠ I NEED MORE
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tuhlorrre,"I'm really glad that we were able to leave Eren for a bit to get to know these characters and see the first episode in the series juxtaposed to Gabi and her friends in this episode.

The team we've been following became the same as those who attacked them. Wonderful writing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Corpulent32,Is it just me who doesn‚Äôt like the new animation style as much? Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love everything else about the show but the cgi doesn‚Äôt look as good imo
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mc-tarheel,"When Colt's eyes went huge realizing the scouts weren't afraid of him? When Pieck realized the scouts were there??

  
Right up there (for me) with, ""is this Levi??"" and ""They were right about you, Levi! You *are* dangerous!""

Just .. \*chef's kiss\*"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Stamora,"At first when Eren wanted to meet Reiner, I thought they would team up and fight their common enemy, the Marlyean oppressors to the Eldian bloodline. The enemy here isn't any group of people. It's the oppression and brainwashing from the Marlean government. 

Both Marlyean Eldians and Paradis Eldeans suffer from this. Wouldnt it be beneficial for all Eldean warriors to go rogue and reclaim their freedom?

If only Eren would convince them about that (I thought that's what the letters hes sending are for)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RoccoSteal,"I love how for a super OP Titan (War-hammer) they gave it such a vulnerable weakness to counter. It just feels like it got beaten a bit too fast lmao but I guess being the last season, everything has to speed up."
RoccoSteal,Twindo,I think the usual transformation is the egg in the chest area rather than outside the Titan body. I would say nape but I feel like the chest might provide better protection. Like where the heart would be.
Twindo,RoccoSteal,No but most of that body is protected in shell so it‚Äôs not really a vulnerable place to put. They had to make it OP but not god-mode. I think the external egg link is perfect.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"So Annie‚Äôs dad said Annie is still alive. This could be desperate parent optimism but I think since he is related to Annie by blood and the fact that she is a Titan, there is some kind of connection between them that makes him sure she is alive."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,saiful_458,It's sad knowing there's only 2 more episodes left
saiful_458,Doctor_God,That's not confirmed? Most likely Part 1 will be 16 episodes. There is too much material to cover in just 16 episodes so it's almost certain there will be two parts/a movie
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThatPeruvianDude,I still get over yesterday‚Äôs episode. Is this normal
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lil_tufa,"Okay I'm sorry if someone has already brought this up (I'm new here), but I have a theory that when the rumor was started that the people of paradis were to escape and ""crush the world"" that this was actually a metaphor for the people of paradis finding out about the cruelty of Marley and starting a rebellion against them. Also to continue keeping the citizens of each nation in the dark and pitting them together as a distraction from the truth?

Also I realized that it was kinda sweet how they show Reiner is actually really similar to Eren in the beginning when you see his backstory as a kid in Marley. He was never considered exceptional by his peers but he had an incredible amount of drive to be seen as a hero and for justice, which reminds me of Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ginestra7,Did my boi Reiner got smashed by Eren's transformation?! Where is he? Is he safe?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fancy-Pair,Why didn‚Äôt eren eat Reiner? Is he no longer the armor Titan?
Fancy-Pair,Graize,"Yeah, that seems weird to prioritize eating Willy when you know for certain that Reiner is a titan. It would have made the Warhammer fight easier too. Maybe they'll explain in the next ep."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bugshunter,"Missing scene? The war hammer titan attacked Mikasa with the whip, but the scene where it creates the whip seems missing, also when it creates the sword!"
bugshunter,Raknel,"> but the scene where it creates the whip seems missing

It's there, right after Mikasa shoots her eye. Watch the Warhammer's left hand light up.

The sword was conjured off-screen tho."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nevers_,What happened to Reiner in the end of episode 5?
nevers_,LlamaLegacy,They mentioned him in the next episode preview so we‚Äôll find out then
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,heartbreakhill,Is the episode messed up on Funimation for anyone else? As the War Hammer is forming mine jumped ahead by like 5 seconds (straight to Eren making a fist and starting to lunch her) and it threw the subtitles off
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jraikin,Practically wet my pants with excitement in this episode. So insane!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uhohbrando,"I‚Äôm calling it now: 

        Eren will loose everyone and everything he has left and will grow even more hateful and vengeful. So much so that he will cause so much destruction until he is eventually on the verge of ending all of humanity with the colossal titans, then someone - who represents good and hope and a new start to a new future - will just barely connect with him enough to remind him of the good person he once was, and that reminder will be enough to convince him to self destruct somehow and save the world from his own chaos."
uhohbrando,CowboyBebopCrew,"I could see something similar... what if Eren basically makes the same decision to become King Fritz who left and walled himself in because of the guilt he felt for all of the destruction and death he causes... only for one of the Eldian survivors (Falco, Reiner‚Äôs sister, etc..) to come for revenge for destroying their home and killing their family and friends? Thus creating an endless cycle to war and violence."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H1N1spoink,I liked most of the cgi but erens face in cgi do be looking a bit funky
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Natura91,"I know, I have been so excited during this 4th season. The characters look so grown up!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamkhatkar,Where did Piek saw Armin before?? I think Cart titan never encountered Armin in season 3. Or am i missing something?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nmmc93,"Can someone tell me where was zeke in the episode? Does it make part of the plan for him not to meddle on the warhammer titan's affairs with Eren?
It has been bugging me a bit"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gigi_1803,Why didn't Eren eat Reiner???
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zact619,"So Is Eren actually blind one one eye? Did I miss something, because even the Titan eye was that ‚Äúblind‚Äù colour. I didn‚Äôt notice if it had healed or not after Titan form later on."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,caramelmac,"If Eren waited to launch his attack on Marley soil after the day after the war declaration, how do you think people would have responded? 

Also, after those first minutes explaining Willy and Magath was expecting the attack, I thought for a hot second that their intention was a revolution against the Marleyan government and ""freeing"" the Eldians there. 

Wish that were the case. 

I still don't understand why Willy hated Eldians. I hope we learn more about it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,darth-stuckus,I have a question witch titan has the cordnate power is it the attack or founder confused because eren has 2 titans
darth-stuckus,as122000,"The Coordinate and Founding Titan I believe is the same.

Eren has the Attack AND Coordinate/Founding"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,What_A_Fiasco,Does the final season take place in the future?
What_A_Fiasco,AnalogMan,There seems to be a 4 year gap between the end of season 3 and the start of season 4.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dostmalone2,When is the new ep supposed to come out?
dostmalone2,Raknel,"In ~10-12 hours depending on the platform. 

Japanese release is in 6 hours but that will have no subtitles so don't watch it unless you wanna get spoiled. Also be careful on youtube and social media around that time since raw footage will start popping up online after that."
Raknel,dostmalone2,Thanks ü§ù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ogcapo,"I really wish wilt was animating AoT, the quality is not the same"
Ogcapo,PSQuestion10,"Couldn‚Äôt agree more.

Can‚Äôt understand how people say ‚Äúthe animation was incredible‚Äù"
PSQuestion10,Nergidiot,"Two reasons, Apologists and those who just arent used to seeing CG like this and dont notice it."
Ogcapo,Dimmadeezy,"Wit also had tons of time to animate the first 3 seasons. Mappa had like 8 months to do this season. The production committee made the schedule and said it had to be done by a certain point. Wit knew they wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it look half as good as the previous seasons with the condensed schedule, so they dropped the show. Even if they had agreed to do it instead of Mappa, there would have been a noticeable drop in animation quality."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TimoorBTS,"I have no words..this is beyond amazing,the squad is back,the hammer titan is insane,the eldian squad destryoing everything in their wayüòç,sorry mikasa eren did what he had to do,killing those innocent ppl is hard to take but they were in their place before,that last scene with the jaw titan fearing humans,10/10 episode! Just show me hange and armin now pls!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Joker7189,Sooooooo anyone not a fan of the 3d titans.... Cause I sure ain't.
Joker7189,LawyerAvocado,"It was really jarring especially when I saw Eren at first. At some points it was pretty good though, but not better than it used to be. With that said, it didn't really take away from the episode for me still 10/10"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Badlemon_nohope,Is no one else disappointed in the downgrade of the animation? It's still entertaining but going from the previous seasons' art to all the cgi in this one is a bit saddening. The story is enough to carry the show but the unbelievably detailed art in the past is what made AoT so incredible for me.
Badlemon_nohope,caretaeking,"If you mention it people will downvote you anyway lol but I agree. But I also understand that people are saying we would‚Äôve never gotten a season 4 if they didn‚Äôt do it because no other studio wanted to do it. I just don‚Äôt get why we aren‚Äôt allowed to talk about the animation not being as sharp / detailed / colored as the previous seasons. In a way the new animation does kind of feel like it‚Äôs because they are in Marley, it‚Äôs all dark and blurred and sets the mood. I just think of it in that way lol"
caretaeking,Hell-On-Earth-2,"Idk man, you can't expect near perfect animation when the studio only has 8 months to work with, it's like expecting a professional project be done in one day"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,"this episode was crazyy i was really shocked! i had goosebumps through the whole episode. such a legendary episode that was really worth the wait!

it's feels surreal seeing eren become like that. i'm having mixed emotion about his transformation. Gabi though poor girl i really felt bad for her, she is going through ethe same thing as eren when reiner and bertholdt broke the walls."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BOPHoldItDown,I like how this implies Porco was warned about Levi. Like Zeke was warned about him by Reiner on the previous season. Man the shock in his face.. he really thought it was gonna be that easy. The marleyans are so naive and so not equipped to fight ..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thiccdude1735,I thought the episode was ok overall but I didn‚Äôt like the war hammer CGI the old titan fights are better
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pikadickshit,"Can we just take a moment to appreciate Zofia's legs? I mean, we didn't get to give them the love they deserved in life but maybe we can make up for them in death."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jimothy_Timkins,The episode is great but I'm not a fan of the CGI especially disappointing because all the hand drawn fight scenes in other seasons looked so good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ambimunch,Great story but wow the PS2 CGI is awful lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Asking_Reverend,The CGI is really putting me to the test. Yikes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Poppun_,The animation/music seemed kinda off for me. I feel like those YouTube motion comics were better paced than this.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,visual_overflow,"Easy 11/10!  

When I heard that zip line sound... omg! 

Also, Scouts looking fly as fuck!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tainted-squid,Is it bad that i was rooting for eren and the scout corps the entire episode?
tainted-squid,44gonfaloniere,"I mean you just followed them through the entire series, of course we are rooting for the squad."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GucciAddict,While the episode was amazing and left me breathless i get annoyed every time i see Mikasa. She looks like a dude now and it's really pissing me off
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Coder_Senpai,"That was the worst animation i have ever seen after Berserk remake. Honestly i would have wait 2 years to watch Season 4 created by WIT, In first episode i was not that bothered by CGI but even now the Human character were in CGI as well during the action, no particle effects nothing. Looks like they rushed the production."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PuddingPleb,"The animation was off for the faster moving characters like mikasa and Levi. The rest of the episode was awesome, but I'm still kind of disappointed that they couldn't capture the movement we saw in earlier seasons from these characters."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jerm2560,"So is Mikasa like, a dude now?:o they said ""is that him? Is that Ackerman?"""
Jerm2560,Giygas,They were talking about Levi. He‚Äôs an Ackerman too.
Giygas,Jerm2560,Ahh I forget he's an Ackerman too lol
Jerm2560,Badalight,They were referring to Levi who is also an Ackerman.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,punchipei,So no one gonna talk about how shitty the animation was?
punchipei,DOOMFOOL,Ah yes. All of the no one talking about is only everywhere across the internet rn
punchipei,Hell-On-Earth-2,You rly pretending like that's not like half of the comments?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,69macncheese69,"The story keeps one-upping itself constantly, though I can't help but be disappointed by the animation. I tried going into it with an open mind after reading some negative comments but I kinda have to agree they ruined aot's flawless animation, the titans are all cgi now. Personally I'd have waited another 2 years if need be for studio wit to end the series the way it deserves. I hope it will get better. It's been such a perfect 10/10 so far in every way it's a shame to lose one of its strongest assets at the very end."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rgswe,"I love everything about this anime! The only thing I wonder is why Mikasas appearance has to be ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô. I loved her old look so I‚Äôm a bit annoyed by that, other than that everything is perfect."
rgswe,DeadOnArriv4l,"Yeah, I also liked more her old look"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dab1ackdud3,"Episode was cool and all but no one really wants to talk about the heavy CGI? I can't recall a single time where they animated Titans or anything with CGI so overtly. Is this going to be a thing for the rest of the season? You can make all the excuses for them you want, go ahead, I'll probably agree with. But saying it's just as good as their normal work, and the work of the previous studios for that matter, is just lying to yourself."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fuzeta_,"Loved the episode but the CGI is really bad, I don't mind CGI but make it good. Seemed kinda slow and heavy unlike previous seasons"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chinedooo,"After scenes like [this](https://youtu.be/CeLvx_1FBdk), honestly the animation and fight choreography in this episode just doesn't compare. Really disappointing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,optionstudent516,Why are so many people crying about the CGI? This is the best anime show out right now stop bitching
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fritzo81,im fucking speechless!üëèüèæ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Solua004,"Amazing episode , not the animation or anything but the people's reactions to the Attack Titan and the Scout Regiment ( or whatever it's called now ), pure gold ."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pianodude01,"I enjoy how they're trying to show how now the mainland is the victim, but we just watched 3 seasons knowing that paradis is the victim, showing how there's 2 sides to war, and neither are right nor wrong.


Also, I hated the original animation style, but the CGI they used in this episode was ass"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hydralo,"I was so hyped but I have to say I was watching and everything was beautifully done, the people, the backstory of the way they anticipated the attack etc. But when they switched to erens 3d model it looked so weird, it feels like they just move his limbs without warping the face or anything, as if it were a mech. SSSS gridman vibes.


Then there was also some 3d very well hidden due to camera angles and by mixing in some gorgeous 2d animation for some the hammer titan and eren scenes. But then, again when eren got impailed with the 3d spike around the 10 minute mark, they showed his 3d model just lying there like a mecha suit at 9:26-9:29 and i was completely out of it.


Also something I noticed was they have also used 3d models for the paradis people. They painted over them well but the way they move and speak to each other, they move in a very stiff robotic way that i've seen in other shows before. 15:13-15-17, is all cgi movement for example. Also, in 15:19-15:21 right after seems just so stiff. Their faces and mouths are also done in a way that you can barely tell which character is which, like sasha and connie are very animated expressive people normally. 



That's all. It is what it is I guess. I think they showed they know how to mask the 3d with 2d animation cause when they did it, it was so smoothly done, so they might fix them later for the season's release for blu ray. Maybe they could do some dramatic close ups with 2d drawings to make things looks smoother during the fights, we'll see in like a year when it comes out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shanky921,"So glad to see Anime only fans really enjoying this. Some Manga fans will come hating the episodes so ignore them and enjoy the ride. You'll are in for a wild one. It only gets better and better.

If you do have any concerns from an animation perspective, I'll just say that the story is so good that it will carry anything. But that's not to say, the animation will be bad. Based on this episode, my concerns actually went away. So have fun discussing and Have fun theorizing :)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YetiManDude342,I'm loving the action but I'm super ready for the plot to unfold. I really want to learn the motivations and stuff that has happened in the past 4 years. I assume eren has trained like crazy and that's why he's able to use his Titan power so well. Also my the only one who thinks Mikasa looks like a man now LMAO.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sinplyevanlopez,"One thing I‚Äôd like to point out is how the War Hammer doesn‚Äôt have ent interest in Eren himself. It‚Äôs been stated that the War Hammer has been privately owned by the Tyburs for years now, and that they have no relation to Marley‚Äôs military. She tries to finish if Eren quickly and kill him instead of eating him and taking his powers. Frankly doing so would hurt Marley a lot more than help it, because then they‚Äôd have no idea who now has the Attack Titan and if it goes rogue it would harm everyone. This makes me think that she‚Äôs acting on her own personal vendetta? Like she couldn‚Äôt care less for war politics and instead is acting on her own moral compass and avenging the slaughtered. Since she‚Äôs not one for war, this makes me believe that she could essentially be a wildcard for either side to manipulate or sway to their side. Also, Mikasa says something of interest. She says, ‚ÄúEren please... Come home.‚Äù This kinda hints that he went off on his own, that he‚Äôs a rogue soldier and none of this was part of their plan. Eren was definitely gambling on her and the rest of the Scouts chasing after him because of his later line. He says something like, ‚ÄúYou guys actually came.‚Äù I think this means that the rest of the Scouts(probably lead by Jean, Levi, and Armin), are acting on their own. I think they plan on taking Eren and getting the hell out of there because they‚Äôre in enemy territory and they don‚Äôt time or supplies to hunker down and establish a base there. Speaking of Armin, we saw him in the last episode. I‚Äôm willing to bet that the bearded soldier who lead Pieck and Galliard to the trap was Armin. Considering his close proximity to the rest of his teammates, I don‚Äôt think that if he transforms, and that‚Äôs a big if, he‚Äôs gonna cause a lot of destruction. I think he‚Äôs gonna stay as a human and act as an impromptu strategist like always and get Eren and the squad back home. Few things of note in the second half. Magath is having the whole internment zone surrounded by soldiers and it makes me wonder how Armin is gonna get everyone out of there. Now I‚Äôm thinking that he might actually transform and carry everyone back to paradis. For the rumbling to happen, the Colossal Titans have to cross the ocean so the sea must not be more than 60 meters deep. Also, Gabi ran off with a gun from one of her dead buddies into the war zone. I don‚Äôt think she dies here because they just killed off Udo and Zofia. This also makes me think that Falco‚Äôs still alive as well. These two got a lot more development, and they‚Äôre both interesting characters. Lastly, the War Hammer is controlled remotely with its user encased in a hardened shell much like how Annie was at the end of season 1. This means that Annie‚Äôs still alive, and since Erens trying to eat the War Hammer that means his jaw can break through the case meaning he can probably get Annie out of there. Annie was genuinely remorseful for what she did and she hated the whole mission in the first place. She wanted to go back after Marcel was eaten. She might honestly join Erens side. That‚Äôs all I have for this episode, keep in mind I‚Äôm an anime only and these are just my thoughts so please don‚Äôt spoil anything if you know. Thanks!"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dMadDuck,"In ep 2 we discovered that the beast titan has more abilities then its predecessors (since Zeke has royal blood) and is pointed out the fact that his titan can talk. Now we see also the warhammer titan talking (also because Lara is royal). But in season 3 when Rainer, Berthold and Zeke were drinking, the Cart titan called them. So i think that also Pieck has royal blood.  
 (no spoiler from manga please)"
dMadDuck,Yes_I_am_beans,"Lucky for you this can be answered with no manga spoilers. Remember in early season 2 when Connie's mom as a titan said ""welcome home"" to Connie? Not to mention in an ova episode when the titan spoke to the scout thinking it was ymir. Point is these titans were just random pure titans, as such its safe to say that the ability to speak isn't one of the things that only royal blooded individuals can do. Its just dependant on whether or not the titan form is capable."
dMadDuck,Raknel,"> also because Lara is royal

She is part of an old Eldian noble family, but the Tyburs aren't royals. Or I mean, they *are* royals in a sense that they pretty much rule Marley, but there doesn't seem to be blood relation between them and the Fritz line. Maybe there is, but I don't think anything's confirmed on that front.

I think every titan can talk if their mouth shape allows for it. Cart could talk, Ymir kinda could in S2 too. Reiner's entire face is hardened so he can't really move his mouth to form words, Eren's teeth are all fucked up. Porco probably has the same problem as Reiner with the hardened jaws.

We didn't hear Annie talk but I think she could if she wanted to. Colossal, no clue."

The way the story telling is going especially with animating the emotional scenes is fucking immaculate. My problem lies with the absolutely horrendous CGI that is the Titans and the PARDIS crew zipping around. The CGI looked liked the type of stuff out of OVERLORD and the infamous Dragon scene from the FATE series. I‚Äôm just saying I could‚Äôve easily waited a year or two just to see more polished animation. It took me a couple minutes not to laugh when the scouts were all zipping towards Porco looking like comedically cheap yoyos.

Edit: better comparison is Berzerk"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Any_Bet1781,"Isnt no one gonna talk about the cgi?
Many powerful moments were actually ruined due to bad cgi animation the titans looked like plastics especially the attack titan .The end scene , where the jaw titan attacked eren looks very weak. Till now I had loved all the episodes execpt this one and that too due to the cgi . I mean if u even compare the  manga eren looks more intimidating when confronting the warhammer titan than the anime. I know the employees had to do it in short span and they r even under paid but it still doesnt change the matter of fact that the cgi and the animation was overall disappointing.

After 8 fucking years of not reading the manga I'm going to start today, the anime is dead to me at this point. I literally sat through that entire episode bored to death, I'm going to get hated on for going against the grain here but this really is OPM S2 all over again.

However it looks like fucking shit. Who had the idea to make titans and people CGI. First three seasons looked amazing and now we have this? What for? Save time on animation or budget? Ona final season?! Eren in titan form looked like a fucking spastic and Jean landing on a roof made looked like he was running in one place. Honestly it's a shame that it will look this pathetic with this shitty CGI. Guess my enjoyability won't be as big as the previous seasons."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Airaneon,"Great to see all the characters coming back to screen. Eren making racional decisions, that was kinda expected, since he got his ego back he had to supress the founder's will that left all the previous heirs stoic.

Huge turn off though was that garbage 3D animation, looks like the studio is being kinda lazy or, for some reason, didn't receive enough funding. If it was some background animation I wouldn't even be bothered that much, but seeing titan Eren, and Jean moving clunkly got me a lil sad."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"THEORY: Zeke has a wavering allegiance with the Marleyan side. In the end of season 3 part 2, Zeke‚Äôs words to Eren was something along the lines of ‚ÄúI will save you‚Äù. Due to Zeke‚Äôs responsibility in turning the people of Paradis island into Titans and killing mosf of the scout regiment, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely that the scouts would let him join their side. What I think is more probably is Zeke aligning himself with Eren for some ulterior agenda. The reveal this episode that Eren has strayed from the plan makes me believe in this theory even more. Not to mention the baseball Eren had and the fact that they are brothers and Titans so they could have some kind of other worldly connection. Zeke was also not trapped with Pieck and Porko but that mysterious guard. To me, it has also seemed that Zeke distrusts the marleyan military somewhat as in the very first episode of this season, Colt asks him what‚Äôs special about Zeke‚Äôs blood, and Zeke recognizing that Magath is nearby give Colt a humorous answer. It‚Äôs clear that nobody in Marley except Zeke knows he has royal blood so I wonder what else he is keeping from them."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nikhil_Subba,Someone said Eren is the smartest MC of all time. Well we all have to agree after all he didn't wait for that Warhammer Titan to fully transform!
Nikhil_Subba,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,"Yup, that was absolutely brilliant.. In a regular anime the villain transforming is shown with glory, the protagonist just stands around and watches"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mafamaticks,"Just a reminder.

We still don't know what Eren saw when he touched Historia. 

Chances are he saw all of this back then and is now carrying it out"
Mafamaticks,JohnHallYT,"My theory is he didn‚Äôt necessarily see anything in the future, he actually saw back into the past. Remember the dream he had in the first episode? It was a vision of everything to come. I think when he touched Historia he kind of sent those memories back to his past self on accident"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Drbraintumor,"I am confused on how to feel here. Eren murdered 1000s of people for revenge. Are we supposed to be rooting for this? The entire episode I kept being like why is he killing all these people? What is this end goal? He has spent the last 4 years learning there is an entire world all around him and that people are not all bad, it isn‚Äôt black and white. Then he just fuckin starts a war with everyone, murdering countless of civilians? What the fuck? I am not hyped to see the crew. I am not hyped for this war. I am just completely turned off. This is a first for me, I have been so on board for the entire series, but this came off as completely senseless. Am I missing something???"
Drbraintumor,LlamaLegacy,"> Are we supposed to be rooting for this?

The story's not telling you explicitly who to root for or who the ""bad guy"" is.

 Look at the dialogue between Eren and the corps in this episode. Mikasa is begging him to come home and to stop killing these innocent civilians, but he just shrugs her off because he knows he has to make the first move before Marley does. Now, it seems like it's not just Marley vs Paradis, but there are now at least 3 separate groups (Marley, Paradis, and Eren) who are all trying to achieve different things through different means. The corps don't necessarily agree with what Eren's doing (look at what Jean said), but they can't really go against him and risk losing the Founding Titan either."
LlamaLegacy,Drbraintumor,"For sure, it is definitely a gray area. It seems weird to me that Eren would just go to town. Doesn‚Äôt he see that the Eldians were getting shafted, and how his own history plays into that? Why did he murder all these eldians, when he knows how mistreated they were, and how the Island was built for peace. Maybe I just need to keep watching, but immediately after this episode, it seemed like such a confusing decision."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,er490taco,"Idk why but the whole show feels off...

er490taco,dongrizzly41,Erin's whole goal is to destroy them all...and he has the attack titan. I think that paring speaks for itself.
er490taco,taskkill-IM,"Yeah why is Eren aggressive?

He only witnessed friends and family die at the age of 10, found out his entire life was a lie, that his dad was a prisoner of War and his aunt was mauled by dogs set upon her at a young age... and that the titans he has hated all his life and spent the best part of 5 years killing were actually his own people who were prisoners of war, captured, and turned into titans themselves.

Not to point out that the world he wanted to see beyond the titans was still full of War and hatred for his people because of something that happened 1000 years ago.

If my AoT sixth sense suggests anything its that they have a fair idea of what's coming for them and Survey Corps would be prepared to outsmart a lot of Marley's perceived 'Ace's before things go wrong, and now that he has the Colossal card to play, oh boy oh boy!"

It has been a huge disappointment since episode 1 but I've been holding it back since people kept saying to wait for it, it's gonna be worth it. It has not. Why do I have to look at the world through the perspective of the people outside of Paradis? They are exactly as evil as Eren and the Paradis people think they are. That piece of shit Gabi is annoying, arrogant, spoiled and eager to kill human beings. Stop fucking comparing her to Eren in the past. Eren saw his mom being eaten ALIVE. He knew nothing, he couldn't understand why it had to happen. This piece of shit Gabi knows. She is hyped for the war declaration. They WANTED to START the war with Paradis first before Eren transformed. Your people wanted to start the chain of violence and you don't understand WHY? 

Story aside, what have the animators done to our characters? They all have chubby looking face. You can barely recognize Mikasa if it's not thanks to her voice, she looks like a freaking man! The CGs kill all the hype moments. Remember how badass Levi, Mikasa were???

Ffs, I don't care how the people outside of the world feels, why don't you give me the perspective of Eren of the scouts? WHY has the main character of the show changed??? WHY do they have such tiny screen time and I am forced to have empathy for shitty people? Judging by the intro, it's gonna continue for the rest of the season. WHY.THE.FUCK.DOES.THE.SHOW.CHANGE.ITS.MAIN.CHARACTER?"
absolutelynose,Badalight,"You have to remember that the Eldians are the ones who started the conflict many years ago. Yes, Marley is now continuing that cycle of violence, but you can't pretend the Eldians are not at fault. The only reason the titan war stopped was because King Fritz and the Tybur family betrayed their own people. You believe Paradis are the ""good guys"" because that's the perspective you've been watching the show from, but the reality is much more complicated than that. Both sides are demons, as they not so subtlety said in this episode. Last episode Eren himself recognized that he and Reiner are the same (but at least Reiner's guilt caused him immense trauma and to actually develop a split personality to cope with said guilt)."
Badalight,Xalbana,"> You have to remember that the Eldians are the ones who started the conflict many years ago.

This begs the question whether the son must pay for the sins of their fathers.

The Eldians now are way different than the Elidans a hundred years ago. And whether the Marleyans have become the type of enemy they hated. War is a viscous cycle."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,unsleeked_Tender,Since when was eren so ruthless? :o
unsleeked_Tender,Efilain,"Since he discovered that his childhood dream of seeing the sea and being free wasn‚Äôt so great since there are millions of people who hate them to the point of segregating Eldians, attacking them, killing their families and that they have been lead to believe that they are the last surviving humans only for him to discover that they are feared and hated?

Basically since the last ep of S3"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Elrodo06,What did i just watch!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Capital-University-6,That was fucking amazing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rusty_Shack1es,Holy fuck yeah
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrypticRD,Fucking amazing is all I can say
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xR4ND4LLx,I watched this on my break at work and had to try really hard to contain my excitement when the Scouts showed up. Holy shit. What an incredible episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Davey0215,THAT WAS SO FUCKING GOOD!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JakeSPixel,Was Levi's entrance handmade animation or was it realy good cgi ? (i'm not sure if that's the correct term but anyway)
JakeSPixel,Eggishtrain,"I think the term is ""Hand drawn"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kitsune-oni,Gabi reminds me so much of Eren. I hope she doesn't make the same mistakes in the future that Eren has made and continues the cycle.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrakoniX227,Good episode but what are your guy's opinion on the CGI?
DrakoniX227,undyingcatcus,"Think I‚Äôm more or less alone, but I thought it was amazing"
DrakoniX227,markpewdieye,"Lacking but not to the point it ruins the episode, at least in my opinion."
DrakoniX227,GroundbreakingSort32,Super poopy
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingKRhule,"HOLY SHIT WHAT AN EPISODE!!! I think the key long term in this war is that the Scouts are all soldiers while, according to Magath, Marley has avoided sending in it's own citizens."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hemisby,"O

M

G

That was such a cool episode , Jesus"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pistachiopowder,"I loved seeing the change in all the characters, Connie changed a ton and it's amazing to see them all"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sassyaspho,This episode was literally 5mins
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maruchanmaster,Although she may be annoying asf this episode really made me feel for gabi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noctiszaoldyeck,"Wow, Episode 63 ended with a Major Cliffhanger, Then 64 eneded with another major cliffhanger, now 65 ended again with another major Cliffhanger

&#x200B;

Only Attack on Titan was able to do this.. They were able to keep the intensity to hit the roof for 3 episodes"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IOftenBreath,More ! I need more !!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrazyCopec,"Udo, Zofia nooo ;-;"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sideofspread,"Confused in the best way. Did Eren go rouge? Why did they come after him if he did? Where's Hanji? Where's Armin? Is Eren just trying to eat all of the big 9? 

So many questions. But I also just feel happy to see my friends again, lol ü•∫"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ItsAshlisticAK,"The episode was prettttty good including the animation and music (from anime only perspective) ü§© Idk why some people are butthurt about Mappa....I mean I kindda get it, I am still a fan of Thick outline animation, pretty eyes and that pretty sky in previous seasons but it was either this or possibly 2-3 years of wait! SO i am happy that we are getting a season.. 
Imo the warhammer titan feels like a liability than a weapon for now lol especially the ground thing or maybe they revealed it too early, should have let them fight for this episode üòÇ 
The Jaw titan scene was soooooo good and now waiting for my boi Reiner 
Also AYEEEE Our squad is back!!!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RunawayAce,So is that a new Sasha?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MACSIEE,"when Levi appeared ugh, big W."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nearby-County7333,i genuinely dont have words right now. i cried several times. it‚Äôs so good to finally see levi squad i missed them so goddamn much.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,undyingcatcus,Could the lights be in place for a titan attack? Seemed like an important point that got glossed over to distract us from it. My guess is using Zeke (not sure who‚Äôs side he‚Äôs on) to produce mindless titans and have Eren control them or maybe the Scouts have Annie on their side and will use her in the battle.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FHI_iSmile,"Wow what an episode. I wonder what has happened to Eren during the last 4 years. When it comes to animation I wouldn't say it was bad compared to Wit, but just different. 9/10"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,waliyt2000,cmon how BADASS is the Attack Titan with 1 eye
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MacabreMiasma,"I really liked it. I really like that they stressed that there‚Äôs no turning back, that Eren completely fucked everyone over by doing this. The deaths of Sophia and Udo (or his near death) were really shocking. Didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd do that. The look on Gabi‚Äôs face as she sees the two men die was great as well. 

The CGI is disappointing. Could only imagine what The Warhammer Titan would look like in season two animation. Her power was really cool though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hummingdog,"Gabi is cool, eren is cool but I was overjoyed to see Captain Levi! Finally! Goddamn his stare and his style is crazy good"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vadus101,holy shit
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Crypter,"Yo, what the fuck.

My mind is blown, i felt like 50 different kinds of emotions throughout this episode, masterpiece."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shahdarawala001,The best thing abt the episode is that my man Floch got a new haircut
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RickyOMFG,does anybody know how many episodes this season will have? i don‚Äôt want it to end :( this episode was beautiful
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oxyjin_js,It seems like that the marleans know who the Ackermen are
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Danes07,"Can we talk about Sasha's shot? Like she hit one straight through his heart, then one in the middle of his forehead.. With IRON SIGHTS. From that far, in such a stress situation, just insane."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PPHillips,"The 2D looks so much better then the 3D. 

Super fun episode though!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Stare_Decisis,Q: What happens when a named red titan eats another red named titan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,favouriteblues,That Sasha-Gabi stare down was too hype. It becomes really apparent how much they look like each other. Why is Armin missing in the heat of battle? I‚Äôm guessing they are up to something in the background. Great episode overall and I feel next week‚Äôs will be even better
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,belgium-noah,"How come the Jaw titan wasn't able to bite through? It's supposed to cut anything, so what did I miss?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kvngmelly,my man Eren does not give a shit anymore
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,switchblade2,"Something tells me that Eren and Co. are about to get clapped next episode. No Beast Titan, and we haven't even seen the Marleyan military yet. Awesome episode but I'm a bit concerned"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PettyFlacko00,"Armin is gonna have a HUGE ‚Äúit looks like there‚Äôs no way out and the main character is gonna die, oh wait... someone saved him‚Äù moment and I‚Äôm ready for it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GutsyEddy,Galliard being so surprised at the end calling the scouts demons was ignorant to me. It was his commanders injecting his people to turn into Titans and run towards Paradis and eat the people in the walls. They had no choice but to adapt to fight titans.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,omgitsaliaggggg,Who was the guy carrying udo to the hospital? I swear I‚Äôve never seen him before.
omgitsaliaggggg,sansaofhousestark99,Colt. The one chosen to be the successor for the Beast Titan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bashara836,im switching to manga so can anyone tell me which chapter is this episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pardusco,"Those Paradis mfs **popped tf off!** I really thought Galliard was about to chomp out Eren. Nope, Levi had to do what he does best and save everyone's ass!

Gabi and young Eren are clearly parallels. Losing the people they love and losing their home. It's so obvious! She is definitely going to do something reckless in the next episode. I just hope it doesn't come back to bite her in the ass.

Eren has abandoned his humanity and Mikasa is concerned about this. I hope he doesn't go too far.

Willy Tybur's plan was pretty good, and it looks like he wanted everyone (including Eren) to think that he was the Warhammer Titan. The Warhammer's abilities seemed to be ridiculously OP, but Eren was intuitive and able to figure it out.

Right now, I'm kinda conflicted on which side to root for. We spent 3 seasons on Paradis and got close to all of these guys, but their actions here are extreme, but I still understand them. The Liberio Eldians quickly grew on me, and it stings to see that Sophia and Udo are dead.

A big theme in the first few episodes was that humanity has advanced past the need for Titans in combat, but this episode shows that one small part of humanity has figured out the best way to utilize them. Paradis was severely underestimated and it looks like they are going to outpace Marley in combat. The only issue is that they don't have the numbers advantage."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,captainKrule,I love how in previous episodes we could kind of see parallels between Gabi and young Sasha (how they both loved to gorge themselves) and in this episode they cross paths and likely alter each other‚Äôs fates permanently.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YamFor,Episode absolutely flew by. Was confused when it ended. Very good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Boomtw3,"Eren didn't just attack out of nowhere. As Mikasa told Eren to ""come home"". It means Eren hasn't been in Paradis Island for a while and we know it's been 4 years since season 3.
When Tybur and Magarth was discussing, there are several spies from Paradis Island. Eren,Jean and co. have monitored the situation and seen the threat of Marley, how they use titans to win war, how they plan to attack Paradis Island soon, how they planned to enlist the help of world leaders to attack Paradis Island as a unit front.
It's better to take fight to Marley so the only casualties are soldiers. If they waited for Marley to attack they will lose"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JerichLevan,"im complaining or anything not showing hate or something i enjoyed the ep but the cg ruined the animation tbh, like the jumping scene where eren found the real body of the war hammer titan, like we see a flash then boom eren have the body, and sound of punching"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EazyyEng,"Connie looks like a legit badass now! Mannn, that episode gave me chills! Waiting for the next episode (hell, waiting for the last three episodes that came out) is hell!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rattle_Head,Attack on ex-arm
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zenkikid,"Tybur is a bastard who deserved that painful death.  


They knew an ambush was coming and knew that many were going to die. Tybur basically said ""fuck it theyre Eldians anyway"""
Zenkikid,Jaaawsh,"He wanted the rest of the world to see the Eldians as victims though too, which is why he set everything up in the internment zone. He‚Äôs trying to show the rest of the world they have a common enemy."
Jaaawsh,Alyxra,"\> He‚Äôs trying to show the rest of the world they have a common enemy. 

Yeah, the common enemy that is the only non-slave Eldians left in the world. Lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BleedingEdge61104,That was one of the best. Such a badass return of the scouts.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AReallyCuriousBarbie,"THIS WAS SO FUCKING GOOD. I GOT CHILLS. I CRIED. IT WAS OVERWHELMING GOOD AND EPIC AND JUST STRAIGHT UP BADASS. I WATCHED THE EPISODE 3 TIMES ALREADY. THE 3D MANEUVER GEARS WERE SO COOL. THE SURVEY CORP WAS SO COOL. EVERYTHING WAS JUST UGHHHHHHH.

IDK HOW TO EXPRESS HOW GOOD IT IS MY HEART IS STILL POUNDING."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Antidepressant617,"So can anyone answer me this, if eren, who is the attack titan, eats, say, the war hammer titan, does he gain their powers? Or is it the same as just killing the war hammer and it gets sent along the ‚Äúpath‚Äù and a random eldian gets it? 

Along these lines, what was the power of the person grisha ate to get the founding titan? (Cause As far as I‚Äôm aware the ‚Äúfounding titan‚Äù isn‚Äôt a type of titan but an ability that can be passed between) Was that a female titan? In which case how did Annie end up with it because I thought she had it at that point already? That‚Äôs the only thing that confuses me. Thanks!"
Antidepressant617,Combat_Wombat23,If he eats the war hammer he would gain its power just like how Grisha took the Founders power from Frieda. Her titan was female because it seems the Founding titan actually adapts to the user more as opposed to the other Titans. Like the war hammer appearing male even though the shifter is female. The Founder is its own unique titan with its own abilities that are locked behind the requirement of having royal blood.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrLightninbolt,I want Eren to eat the war hammer titan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,awesomecooper,"I'm surprised that people(including me) are surprised by how ruthless eren has become but the fact is eren has already killed number of innocents inside Wall Sina.

Eren seems to orchestrating the attack but no way I think that this was not coordinated and calculated. Eren is calmer then ever, his conversion with Reiner proved that. He already has allies in the Orinent Landy who saved udo in the party and she conveniently left before the attack begin.

Paradise in a normal war don't stand a chance, they either make strong allies or engage in gorilla war fare. I think they are doing little of both.

I just hope that Eren has a plan for what's next."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LuiTurbo,"Do you guys think Falco will admit to Gabi that he was unconsciously working with Eren? He seems like the type to blame himself for all of this causing her to become concerned, and his guilt overwhelming him to the point where he admits what he did. Gabi hating him forever"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,B_024,"To those who didn‚Äôt understand the beginning, Willy knew he would be attacked during the speech. He was expecting it, and used it to have himself and a bunch of important people from the world be killed by the ‚ÄúDevils‚Äù so he had them seated closed together near the stage. It was to urge the world and turn them all against Paradis by painting them in a bad light.

That‚Äôs why his family was crying, because they all knew he‚Äôd be dead soon."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,danielwilu2525,"I‚Äôm just so happy that no matter how high I set my expectations, Isayama and MAPPA always go above and beyond."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mk_d_mc,"‚ÄúBefore you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves‚Äù."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RelicHunter2000,Greatest episode ever
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xskull248,If was sooo sick
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Robinlman,"Amazing episode, loved everything!

One question though: if a titan shifter like eren eats the Warhammer Titan, does the lifespan increase for 8 years again? And what happens to the titan powers? Do they merge? Does one get lost?"
Robinlman,Jaaawsh,"I think they merge, because Eren already has two of the nine. He‚Äôs had the attack titan and the founding titan, since he first became a Titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,luismarcelomf,I got chills throughout the whole episode it was so fucking intense
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Romano16,"Remember, the Marleyans may have Anti-Titan Artillery, which certainly packs a punch, but Artillery is only useful if it takes out the Titan in the first shot or is protected in the back line....

We have seen time and time again that stationary units are terrible against titans as most of the time they aren't killed by cannon/artillery fire. 

3DMG that the scouts use are also unheard of except by Zeke who found the invention fascinating. Which is why the Jaw Titan is scared."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sajkhow,"Still not getting used to with the Titan being CGI‚Äôd, Well it‚Äôs only been like the second time we seeing this.

That aside, I literally have never felt so satisfied with a cliffhanger, they completed the build ups so well!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Notlikethisfifa,"This episode was so fucking amazing. Only thing that bothers me (personally) is that it seems it won‚Äôt be the one sided massacre we thought it‚Äôd be. Also seems like this attack planned with that much detail, it was more of Eren hoping his friends came for his aid. Hopefully they succeed and don‚Äôt suffer too many casualties.... fuck I‚Äôm so excited for next week"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chemical_Industry_48,Man I wait 4 yrs for this and loved every bit of it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GuacomoleAssSpray,WHAT A FUCKING EPISODE BEAUTIFUL
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Notlikethisfifa,Seemed like Eren orchestrated most of this on his own and wasn‚Äôt even sure if help would come. I wonder what Levi is thinking. Best guess would be he thinks this was wrec less and evil. I can see him scolding eren for this after this arc is over...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mithranel,Eren and Mikasa have finally completed their hairstyle swap
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hannyy101,WHEN LEVI MADE THAT EXTRANCEEE.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Oliviauwu_,Zofia did a Obito
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,doutordoutor,I'm shook...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheZebrraKing,Everything is great about is expect for the cgi looks really bad but how everything it plays out still get a 9.5/10
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,batfastarddom,No ones saying it... but what are the lights for? ü§®
batfastarddom,TheFuckGotStuck,Maybe just an indicator that they cleared the area. Might also be signal for someone - armin perhaps.:)
batfastarddom,jojo_not10,Perhaps to show where elevated places are so they can use their maneuver gear but then that theory dies down bc they can use the buildings to move around with.. can't wait to find out!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hannyy101,"Iv so mad that Sasha spared Gabi , if she kills anyone I hope it‚Äôs like floch, I care too much about everyone else üò¢"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KhaledEX,whats the name of the track that plays when mikasa shows up? is it new ost?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IGotchaYou,"The writing of this story is amazing. Isayama is a genius.
I liked the choice of music, but felt the volume was too low.
Also I miss seeing their expressions and faces while fighting. 3 second close up of Levi wasn't enough.
The scouts entry gave me goosebumps. I missed them like anything.
I liked seeing parallels between Eren and Gabi,but I am still team Paradisian."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nearby-County7333,"i‚Äôm watching it again and i noticed something. the part where a bunch of scouts appear behind magath and is soldiers, around 13:35, theres a scout that looks suspiciously like armin or zeke. blond hair and some sort of bowl cut. üëÄ"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sheamurp,"JUST WOW WHAT AN AMAZING EP, that ending had me so hyped, some rally badass moments this ep with Mikasa and that entrance of Levi was so awesome can‚Äôt wait until the next one now!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ksima_03,"Im legit shaking, that's all"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,glizzysam,So is commander magath dead? If so what is the marleyan military plan in the future.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mctravie,If she had the titan I wonder was the knowledge passed down from her to Willy with the whole truth
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tekneqz,"The scene where Eren is watching the war hammer titan form, epic af."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EnderWin,"Personally, I think that this episode should've had a more harsher, sinister, or outright menacing soundtrack so that scenes needs you to focus more on it.  


Anything aside, this is a great episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,devinm718,"For some reason the style of this season is kind of growing on me. Something about the CGI gives off a darker, more grim theme to titan combat. I‚Äôm loving the dark and brutal nature of this season. AOT has always had brutal scenes, but something about seeing Eren pummel the bleachers that violently was crazy. No hesitation, no holding back, just the brutal reality of one advisory unemotionally dispatching his enemies as efficiently has possible. Some people are getting hung up on the animation/cgi, but for me it‚Äôs drawing me deeper into the true nature of this season. The dark and morally ambiguous nature of a war predicated on the survival of an entire race."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Symboic,"I think its funny how the jaw titan is in awe about how theyre not afraid of him, like they didn't send thousands of titans over basically training a special ops team specifically trained to kill titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IamLALO,Someone else assumes that Eren ate Annie?; therefore he was able to control better the ability to crystalize his fists and not just his knuckles.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bruhbeanhead,It was funny when they said to keep civilian casualties to a minimum but Eren wasn‚Äôt having it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pure_me,what chapter manga do i read? if i want to continue
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MisterBit130,"I just realized that the change of studio impact fits just right.

They are doing an amazing job, but even if the art style was different, we are looking at a timeskip, where you expect and want to see how things have changed.

The change of studio that give a little different vibes fits right in with a change you want from a timeskip.

Amazing episode by the way!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LieutenantForge,I feel like my whole body just had an orgasm. Holy Shit. If someone claimed AOT was the best show ever made I honestly wouldn't even question it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xx69sillygoose69xx,This seems off. I feel like they were kicking their ass WAY too much
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,blacktron16,"My takeaway from the episode is that there are no heroes in war. Our scouts from paradis have become the titans, breaking in the walls of Marley, and Eren has become the very thing he swore to destroy. Maybe these next fees episodes will sway my view, but the scouts and eren are seeming to be put in the place of the antagonists and the marelyans as the protagonists"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cdent713,how many episodes will there be after this?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BAREFOOTPigs,"ive watched a lot of anime in my time, and I think this was the very best episode i have EVER seen. but maybe thats just the recency bias because I finished the ep like 5 mins ago and still am speechless due to the sheer shock of the awesomeness."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nearby-County7333,the way that i was so surprised when pieck was shocked when she heard the odm gear. i completely forgot that she was on the island and saw them LMAO
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BAREFOOTPigs,"Seeing the whole squad all grown and badass is so pog. 

they look like true soldiers now, not even afraid of death. they have seen too much blood being shed; of their own and of their enemies. they are heartless, brutal killing machines now"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BAREFOOTPigs,"on a side note.. i feel bad for the normal titans on paradis now lmao. that meme of ' the walls protect titans from levi' is true now, but for every single survey corp"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,metalgeargreed,Im curious. What would happen if Eren ate all the of the Nine?
metalgeargreed,LlamaLegacy,He probably just gets all of the powers? I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything special
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BAREFOOTPigs,So Levi with the OG ODM gear had Beast on the brink of death... I'd imagine even like a trio of Sasha Connie and Jean could wipe the floor with him now lmao.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BAREFOOTPigs,the warhammer is so OP. give it to someone with half a brain and they'd be the strongest thing alive.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jonwinslol,Guys how many episodes we got left? Saw somewhete only 10 left but I was under the impression we got something like 20 left?
jonwinslol,LlamaLegacy,Yeah there are only 16 episodes total in this season. There will probably be a Season 4 Part 2 or a movie though
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Littletom523,I love how Levi is the only person wearing the classic scouts gear with the classic green hoodie! He is the only one!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StayStrongAMP,This episode has me soooo hyped. Loved this episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shanky921,Udo was quite the open minded person in the end
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JESquirrel,I really hope Mikasa still feels the same way about Eren after all this.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,radmav,What ever happened to annie?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviox55,So epic how Eren and the scouts are finally on the offensive after all they've suffered
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Taddlee,"Is there any other place to watch the episode tonight outaide of Hulu, crunchyroll, or funimation. 
And I cant make a free account ): 
I love AoT and this sucks being so close to it, yet so far away."
LlamaLegacy,hrdp453,"Agree. What I still don't get is if Marley knows that you need someone with royal blood to unlock the Founding Titan's full powers. As far as they know, there is noone of royal blood outside of Paradis since Zeke's been hiding his status."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skankalite,"When the scouts first showed up alongside the throwback music, I was so excited. But as the fighting went on, it felt different than in previous seasons. It is no longer a cut and dry fight against evil. Of course, it is still a fight for the existence of the people of Paradis, but the new moral complexity makes the fighting seem much more somber, bleak, and dark."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gregarious_yogi," BRUH. When that music hits at the 12 min mark ‚Äî ABSOLUTE CHILLS. 
What a masterpiece"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flognaw23,Keep rewinding to when levi makes his appearance. Holy fuck the chills
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Frank_10,Ido why they still delay the adaption by so much like the first 5 minutes could‚Äôve been left out
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GeneralTabbyCat,"So, what happened to Reiner and Falco?"
GeneralTabbyCat,LlamaLegacy,They mentioned Reiner in the next episode preview so we‚Äôll have to wait
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PalmFingerNails,Marley was hyping up the devils of paradise and scouts exceeded anticipation
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"Congratulations Floch, you wanted a devil like Erwin, well now you‚Äôve got one, and dare I say, this one is an even colder motherfucker."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,honorable_axolotl,"""Any last words?""
""Mikasa. It's now or never.""
When I tell you I SCREECHED-"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RoseL123,"The only saving grace I can see for Porco and the War Hammer is Reiner at this point, and even then it‚Äôs questionable. I guess Pieck probably will come in as well, since she was looking for her gear, but I don‚Äôt see her as much of a combat Titan. Also, the Paradis gang still has Armin in their pocket, which is practically a trump card (didn‚Äôt the Marleyans refer to the colossal as the strongest Titan?).

I can see things getting hairy for the Paradis Eldians, because otherwise we won‚Äôt get to see Armin‚Äôs Titan, but I don‚Äôt see any way for the Marleyans to come out with a W."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sadmanray,"Idk if this has been explained before but why does Willy, a known Eldian, have so much influence over the planning and execution of Marley's plans? Like his character doesn't seem like it should exist. Like firstly, he's super rich because his family worked with Marley early on. That's fine. But the fact that he is able to flaunt it and host so many people obviously means that people respect him. 

I ask because it seems like everyone, including the Eldians, hate the existence of the Eldians. Hence, it seems weird that they'd put their ideological differences aside, especially when it comes to military and defence, and let an Eldian be so instrumental in the planning of an attack.

Is there a reason?"
Sadmanray,Sakularad26,Because until Willy revealed the truth everyone thought that the Tyburs freed Marley from king Fritz. Also they‚Äôre still in control of one of the nine Titans and no one knows who has the Titan. It‚Äôs like an insurance. Therefore the Tyburs have a lot of influence around Marley and the world.
Sadmanray,xellospm,They explained in in the last few episodes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,souaiway,okay but where reiner and falco???
souaiway,LlamaLegacy,They mentioned Reiner in the next episode preview so we have to wait probably
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pavlosd,"Why are they in the dark when it comes to 3D gear?

Didn't Zeke grab Mike's gear?

  
If he didn't give it to the higher ups of the Marley army the i wonder what did he do with it."
pavlosd,Sakularad26,Maybe they didn‚Äôt thought it would be important. We saw how they reacted when Reiner told them about the best spot to attack. He was giving them informations and they didn‚Äôt give a fuck. Maybe it‚Äôs the same situation with the ODM gear.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EdleRitter,Mikasa once again the ultimate MVP.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EdleRitter,The scouts flying around shooting rocket launchers at people reminds me of fighting hackers in shooting games or GTA.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EdleRitter,Magath low key got the most if not the entire Marley military command killed so he could take control.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrMxylptlyk,I feel like Warhammer lost too easily :(((
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dat_Fiyahhh,"Please whatever all mighty there is, do not let eren and the scout resolve falter to bring the pain ten-folds, misaka is already disappointing me"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DanDamage12,The gang is back together! War crimes and all! I bet Armin is there somewhere. He probably orchestrated all this. I can‚Äôt wait to see colossal Armin. My guess he will do something to cover their escape or be the Ace up the sleeve.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,twelvesthings,Mikasa is so devastated. Eren has killed hundreds of civilians and children. There is no going back.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,looooolmonster,What a fucking episode. As an ANIME ONLY im so fucking hypeeeeeeeeeed right now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,centyauro,Ok... Hold on... Just let me rest before discussion
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DooterOomholtz,"I‚Äôm still left with a few questions. Why would they want Eren to take the War Hammer Titan? Wouldn‚Äôt they be more powerful if a different person took War Hammer, so that they‚Äôd have two powerful titans to fight with instead of just one? And is the Founding Titan another word for the Attack Titan, or are those two different titans that eren inherited?"
DooterOomholtz,zombie_goast,"I'm sure they would much prefer to give Warhammer to someone else to increase their Titan numbers, but they don't have a way to turn someone into a Pure Titan first, their one and only sample of the required syringe was used on Armin."
DooterOomholtz,LlamaLegacy,"> is the Founding Titan another word for the Attack Titan, or are those two different titans that eren inherited?

They are 2 different titans. Remember that at the end of s3, Eren Kruger had the **Attack** Titan, which he passed to Grisha. Grisha then stole the **Founding** Titan from the Reiss family, so he had both of them. Finally, Grisha passed both of those down to Eren so he has both the Attack Titan (powers unknown) and the Founding Titan (can control other titans, erase memories, and use Wall Titans to destroy the world).

> Why would they want Eren to take the War Hammer Titan?

Look at the dialogue this episode. Eren is surprised Misaka and the corps came to Marley, and Misaka is begging him to come home. That means that Eren somehow has his own separate plan, but forced the survey corps into it. He originally just wanted to make the first move after Willy declared war, but since the War Hammer Titan showed up, he decided he might as well take the bonus and eat it as well."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AudaciousXII,Great episode!!! No way Porco and war hammer die right away right???? Also makes you think who trapped Porco and Pieck because it seems like they were protecting them both instead of trapping since Porco just went to attack eren alone without any of the other warriors. Gabi‚Äôs anger is much like Erens and I worry she gets vengeance on Sasha. Seeing Levi already was nuts and he will make his promise on beast titan. 10 episodes left and I wonder by the end if eren will be facing some of his comrades soon at this rate
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lapipo04,If eren eat the warhammer titan doesn‚Äôt that mean he gains it‚Äôs ability
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CommonRedditUser78,I died laughing where Willy was like ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôre both devils‚Äù and then it‚Äôs just a black screen transition to willys dead lifeless body.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dianasbracelets,"I've been looking over the comments, and am I the only one who remembers the Beast Titan taking the little doodad from the ODM gear of Miche Zacharius? Do you think the Marlians have reverse engineered that doodad to make some kind of surprising comeback coming up?"
dianasbracelets,LlamaLegacy,"Well at the end of S3 it said that technology on Paradis is 100s of years behind compared to the rest of the world, so Marley probably has something more advanced anyway"
LlamaLegacy,Hell-On-Earth-2,"Well, in these 5 episodes, we saw how dumb Marley is, knowing their arrogant asses, they probably dismissed it and saw it like it wasn't a threat at all"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stray_potato,"I'm betting that Armin is gonna nuke the incoming military.

And Gabi is gonna hurt someone considering all her training and all the titans being distracted. She does have a gun after all.

Eren, you got some 'splaining to do! Sounds like he went alone.

Also lol Warhammer has to be plugged in to work.

Not everyone watches the teasers so...[Season 3/End of Season Teaser](https://youtu.be/crQWX16ir0c) Spoiler Ahead:

>!After seeing this episode, I think the person in jail from the teaser is the Warhammer? It's either Warhammer or Cart Titan but I'm gonna guess Warhammer because they're in an egg right now and also...the prison bars are similar to the bars on the Warhammer's face and we know that nothing is ever coincidence.!<"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zombie_goast,"Bruh I get that he did it on the off chance that Willy himself was the Warhammer Titan plus the shock value it had on his enemies, but am I the only one who's a little shook by how casual Eren was about eating Willy? Just fucking cold man, especially considering the root of his hatred comes from witnessing what happened to his mother."
zombie_goast,caretaeking,"I was shocked, I don‚Äôt remember any of the titan shifters actually eating a human"
caretaeking,zombie_goast,"Exactly! It's one thing for a brainless pure Titan to eat someone now that we know it's just pure instinct, but imagine being stone-cold conscious and away and chomping down on some lil 2 inch tall (from your perspective) dude? Hard-core and cruel to another level."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,korn96,This has most likely already been asked but how many episodes is the season going to be?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bigman_tingz,I love how Jean is in charge of his own squad now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,remmon22,Now I know why the Panzer unit looks scared and bamboozled by how Pieck interact with a sweet smile plus a hug. She's usually pretty serious and bossy around them.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Child_Traphicker123,I‚Äôm wondering what the lights Sasha was putting up are for
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Paetoja,"Never thought I would cheer a successful terrorist attack,but here we are.

One hell of an episode, loved every second of it, heart still pounding."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,smurrth,I think Eren going a bit genocidal is definitely a consequence of him eating the founding titan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vAts_,"Incredible episode , the only weird thing about it is that according to Mikasa Eren attacked on his own , but when the scouts came they seemed to have a plan (placing those lights for some reason) , does it mean Eren just came on his own and the letters falco sent were to Mikasa and them with information or the entire thing was planned but Mikasa didn't expect Eren to be so ruthless?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crawlingturtle,Why does it feel that somehow it's important that the first strike back was from the soldier and not Warhammer Titan as if she was waiting to fight back?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Axelonesl,Dude like wtf happend with Eren? I completely forgot about that at tge end of last episode but hes killing civilians and kids now? like what? This is the same Eren from the previous seasons? like damn...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lomag098,I wonder if we'll ever see annie again
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AcousticAtlas,A good point was brought up. The entire world is going to come crashing down on paradis and technology has already surpassed the need for Titans. I doubt this is going to end well for Eren.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Banana_Swagg3r,"No Porko! Don't you worry yourself, they just rushing you for a big fat hugging kiss then bend the knee to you the almighty magnificent Lion titan.

Clueless kid should have paid attention to Peek's reaction once she saw them."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gpthatslife,"I just rewatched the first episode in English

And Im wondering why Falco was talking about being in the sky with two swords?? 
Where would he get those memories from?"
gpthatslife,vAts_,Probably implies he will turn into a titan because like what happened with the owl it seems like titans are connected in some weird way
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FreyWolfenshire,So now Reiner is a superior warrior since he can fly around like the scouts and can be an effective counter against them
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FuriousKale,Yo guys who was the blond dude with Gabi and Udo?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tremaparagon,"Anyone here read the Claymore manga? I'll try to keep vague about any spoilers but who else felt the big post-anime ""ghosts"" energy this episode? lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,krazykraz01,"My no-spoiler, Big Brain prediction is that Hange managed to acquire the Female Titan in the last 3 years. That seems more likely to me than them either turning or forgetting about Annie, and adds to my idea that her and Armin are being saved as tactical nukes for the battle."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shanksmee,why didn't they gank up on the warhammer titan ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadOnArriv4l,"Don't know if anybody talked about that already, but how the fuck Eren got his titan all fucked up, gone back to human form, then transformed in his titan right away when needed ?? What was his Attack Titan powers again ? Was it already revealed ? Could it have something to do with him been able to transform again without much time to recover ? Like his Titan having more stamina than others ?"
DeadOnArriv4l,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,No this is normal. Even Annie did this in season 1 with the female titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reader575,I wonder why they didn't take out the titans they captured. It seems they had plenty of chance to keep them out of battle. The way Pieck hugged the guy was too obvious for Armin not to notice.
Reader575,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,"You can't kill a human-titan, they will always regenerate. You can either eat them, or wait for 13 years"
TheGuyWhoReallyCares,Reader575,"I don't know about that, there were two cases with Reiner where he said had he not sent the signal in time, he would have died. One being when levi stabbed him in the neck, the other when he transferred his conscious to the armoured titan and finally when Bert didn't want to transform because he was worried about killing Reiner. Nevertheless, they probably could have incapacitated them in some way. When they were up against Annie, when they found Reiner in the wall, everytime it seems they have an advantage, they don't pull it off. Next ep it seems all the titans are back. Something I think after 4 years of planning, they could have avoided."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,So is Reiner dead or what?
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,44gonfaloniere,"I don't think so, neither is Falco. Otherwise they had shown us their deaths. Zofia and Udo are pretty dead.
Reiner is too important and Falco had too much build up to be thrown away offscreen."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,"I think Reiner can't die.. No matter how hard you try to kill him, he'll regenerate"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,R_Wolf_48,I love the repeated examples of people with dreams being forced to become devils to pursue them. Eren looks so done with the world and Erwin well.... he‚Äôs lost his side splitting sense of humor.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TRS2800,I feel like the location of the WarHammer titan shifter's body was too obvious
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,War hammer Titan is op.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Leemas9,Could the Warhammer Titan not eat Eren because of the armour strip things covering her mouth?
Leemas9,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,She has full control over her hardening.. The war hammer titan is creepy to be honest
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brainvas,"Exactly my hunch, ty. Im ok with the anime staying at mappa, just give em a bit more time. I know they could do amazing work"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frankmejia7,What I don't like about this episode was that music did not match the feeling of excitement as previous seasons
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tenphan0n0,"I like the design of the new ODM gear. It's not just them zipping around like Spider-Man which would take abnormal human strength, but it's part of an arm extension from the main unit on their back. 

I'm curious if they'll mention any advantages to the new design. Seems more susceptible to damage than just the waist unit Levi still seems to use."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Razor-kun,"I loved this episode so much. It's really ironic that they call them devil's, even tho they're basically the ones who made them into devil's."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Exxile_,Ok so... how is this season going to end and how is this the final season? Because it‚Äôs impossible for this season to conclude the story... these episodes have been pretty good in my opinion (besides the CGI titans). I‚Äôm just going to assume they‚Äôll be an animated movie to conclude the story.
Exxile_,LlamaLegacy,"Probably a Season 4 Part 2, since there will still be 20+ chapters to animate and S4s only gonna cover 20ish"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Razor-kun,1 thing tho that got revealed last ep I don't quite understand. Who tf is sending letters to paradise? Like I get falco put em in the mailbox but how did they make it to the island? Why would they allow for mail to be sent there?
Razor-kun,LlamaLegacy,"Are you sure it was Paradis? Remember at the end of episode 1 we saw Jean undercover in Marley, meaning that they were already there"
LlamaLegacy,Razor-kun,Oh yea true. It's just that eren being surprised about mikasa coming and her saying come home made it seem like she never left the island. Ig he probably just mailed jean and he radioed them or something
Razor-kun,Twindo,It wasn‚Äôt Paradis lol. It was Eren‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily‚Äù in Marley. Marley does not have postal service that goes across the ocean to the island full of people they hate.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,napes22,Ahhh! Why must they end every episode at such an exciting point!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,murrkingu,So far s4 has been very good but I don‚Äôt like erins roar would have been better to have his regular screaming
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,adamkorhan123,How come the war hammer Titan can talk? Are the Tyburs royal blood?
adamkorhan123,Twindo,Titans with lips can talk. Titans without cannot. It‚Äôs as simple as basic mouth anatomy. Going off of this it is most likely that the colossal and female Titan have the potential to talk but don‚Äôt which make sense given that their shifters aren‚Äôt the most talkative people.
adamkorhan123,Jaaawsh,"I think the intelligent Titans that have mouths that allow them to talk, can talk. I recall reading something that said the reason Eren‚Äôs attack Titan doesn‚Äôt talk is because his mouth is formed in a way that doesn‚Äôt let him. Could be wrong though, since I don‚Äôt think the armored titan ever talks but it would appear his mouth would allow him to if he wanted.
Then again, I dunno why say, the pure Titan that killed Ilse could talk."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MEEPER69,"Wow, just wow."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,manedpasha,"So what happened to Ymir from season 2? Did she eat the Jaw titan or another titan few years earlier? Also was she brought back to Marley and eaten by someone?

I couldn't follow her story."
manedpasha,dongrizzly41,"paradise. randomly ate the other guy when when reiner, Berthold, and Annie first got to paridis.she went back with reiner to the mainland out of pitty and ended up getting eaten by porco."
manedpasha,Xalbana,Ymir felt guilty about eating Marcel who was the original Jaw Titan so she went back to Marley. Marley reclaimed the Jaw Titan by having Porco eat her.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,i felt the same way watching this episode as i did while watching avengers infinity war for the first time. that's the only way i can describe that state of euohoria lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,andrew_west,Why did they put lights on the roof ? Did I miss the explanation ?
andrew_west,RoccoSteal,Probably a signal is my guess. Maybe to Armin? He‚Äôs the only one we haven‚Äôt seen yet.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Thevoidawaits_u,can anyone explain the lights thing?
Thevoidawaits_u,CloudMafia9,Next episode probs...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OldBirth,I'm most curious about what happened to Zeke. ü§î
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iguessithink,"I want to preface this with saying that I LOVE what I am seeing from this season so far. But that being said, I am worried by the lack of protagonist to route for. I understand that the moral ambiguity is the point, and it is effective. But, I feel very disconnected from the characters and I find myself not really routing for any of them. Of course, we're only a few episodes in, and we've only just barley gotten to see the familiar faces from the previous seasons, so hopefully, thing will be cleared up soon."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MyTVAlt,"I wonder what's going on with Zeke. He cant be too far away, I wonder why he hasn't jumped in yet."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IWasMadeToDownVote,"I wish Magath made the prudent choice on just shooting to kill. Reclaiming the founder and or the attack when you can very easily remove the head of this operative, even if it only  delays the trouble for 13 years, would make the war on Paradis so much easier....

With no founder, there is no rumbling, you could ensure a war and crush them since their figurehead is dead.

Otherwise, I like Magath, just feel like this one decision is the dumbest thing I've ever heard when so much is on the line..."
IWasMadeToDownVote,dinosaurfondue,"You forget that the other countries still don't view Marley positively. The point of trying to recapture the founding titan was so that they could attempt to keep an upper hand. If they killed Eren, the founding titan would revert to one of the royals, not a random in Eldia."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uhohbrando,Why didn‚Äôt Eren kill Reiner**
uhohbrando,Doctor_God,Who?
Doctor_God,Eggishtrain,I think he means Reiner
uhohbrando,Eggishtrain,Man plays overwatch so much that Reiner autocorrects to Reinhardt lol
Eggishtrain,uhohbrando,bro üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yoda_intoxicated,If I was to start reading the manga after the latest episode what chapter would it be?
yoda_intoxicated,LlamaLegacy,Chapter 102
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,momu1990,Did Eren eat Annie? He hardened and  crystallized his arms while fighting the warhammer titan.  The selective hardening ability I think is something that the Female titan had. It's been a hot sec since season 3 but I don't think anything happened to Annie beyond leaving her in that crystal form awhile back. But now that we saw Eren can harden parts of his body is it fair to speculate Eren ate Annie before leaving Paradis Island?
momu1990,LlamaLegacy,We‚Äôll have to wait to see how Eren breaks the war hammer titans crystal first. I think if he can break that then it‚Äôs fair to speculate about annie
LlamaLegacy,momu1990,"actually, I just remembered back in the underground Reiss cave ritual place, Eren drank a weird titan serum and gained the ability to crystalize and save everyone when the cave was collapsing. 

In my head, I would much prefer it if Eren only gained the hardening ability through eating Annie. I don't like the idea of someone just easily gaining such a powerful ability by drinking a serum. Oh well, but it does beg the question about what really does end up happening to Annie, we'll have to wait and see."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,valdor_Shinata,Who was the soldier that lured titans into the trap in the previous episode?
valdor_Shinata,Doctor_God,You'll find out later (also those titans have a name lmao)
valdor_Shinata,Eggishtrain,It ain't Armin because In the trailer Armin is seen on a row boat in the water about to transform. In a scene from the recent episode Magath is calling in reinforcements from the mountains and..... The fleet of ships at sea. I'm certain Armin is waiting for them so he can take them all out at once with the initial explosion when he transforms
valdor_Shinata,Axiser,"As i said in an earlier comment, i think that the tall soldier is a female she/he had eyelashes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UnFocus15,I think Lady Kiyomi  knew about the attack cause she left the event
UnFocus15,Eggishtrain,"Yeah, that's common knowledge for most people. That also happened last episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,drank_your_water,So who do we think the mysterious body guard is? Thought it might've been Armin but he doesnt have a beard in the trailer shot
drank_your_water,Doctor_God,Also they have two different voices so definitely not Armin
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,that_onekid22,"This episode was hard to watch. You‚Äôd cheer for one side but then realize the other side is failing now. I think the real bad people were the marlyans for treating the gildians like dogs and attacking the ones still inside the walls. It‚Äôs truly a messed up system. I also wish that when the battle of wall Maria ended, Erin was kidnapped and while hearing about what the world was like from Mikasa and the others reading the books in the cellar, we would see the marlyian town from erin‚Äôs perspective"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ultron-v1,"Just finished the episode. The shock on the jaw Titan when he saw the horde of Eldians coming towards him to take him out...simply fucking incredible. Reading the manga wasn't this exhilarating. It's a shame there's so much CGI, but I absolutely loved this episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reader575,I really hope this is all going according to plan. 4 years they had and it doesn't seem they've successfully removed any of their titans from the fight even though they managed to trap all of them.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sam_moisture,You think someone could rotoscope the cg?
sam_moisture,Doctor_God,MAPPA uses rotoscoping sometimes but I don't think they will for the titans
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AJs3rdAlt,"The negligence of Porco is kind of annoying to me. Like he knows that the Paradis people have fought Titans but he's still thinking ""I'm A tItAn Be ScArEd"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mechengr17,"I know I'm a little late to the party, lol


But the comments have me wondering if this is something like Zero Requiem from the OG Code Geass anime"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mbattagl,"Ok I know I'm late from when this first came out, but Jesus AOT has to have one of the best continuity and symbolism in media in general. The way the attack on Marley reflects how the hatred Eren developed when Wall Maria fell, the look in that teen girl soldier's eyes after all the soldiers and her friends were killed, it's all a circle of violence.

This story is amazing!"

But the thing is he is certainly smart enough to realize that regardless of how much of an obedient dog he is, the Eldians will still be treated like dogshit"
madstork2,saadx71,My guess is eren while incognito sent him a letter or something to meet up and told him the plan.

Axel_Wolf91,Cdntrooper19,Levi cutting up zeke
rickrino,darkmarineblue,"I think that in the entirety of AoT there has never been a happy storyline, the best we had were some bitter-sweet moments. Even when Eren reached the sea he was depressed. This show is suffering and suffering only."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kartickjonty4,"I guessed that Gabi would be the one to kill Sasha after the shot where she stares at Sasha shooting the marleyan soldier from the rooftop. Sasha could have killed Gabi then and there itself but she didn't want to kill a child. 

Ironically Sasha was killed because she showed mercy during war!"
kartickjonty4,Saarthak8,That Commander Lobov guy also hesitated that cost his life. Now I wish he had shot Gabi....

kartickjonty4,Nearby-County7333,for some reason i still can‚Äôt find it in me to hate gabi. i love sasha but i can‚Äôt help but pity gabi
Nearby-County7333,spellingcunts,Because you have empathy for her and know that she‚Äôs just a product of her upbringing. Honestly the reactions from some people here towards her are kind of disturbing. Especially since she is meant as a parallel to Eren.
Nearby-County7333,LuckyRoro,"Agreed - in Gabi's eyes, Sasha is the murderer who killed the guards who were always nice to her despite her heritage and is apart of the reason why Zofia, Udo and everyone died. 

Sasha is one of my favorite characters and I damn cried this episode, but pointing fingers is literally such a black and white perspective during a war like this"
kartickjonty4,lightningpresto,By that logic with Jean and Falco...
kartickjonty4,chronoboy1985,"Ah yes, the Saving Private Ryan moment. Except I doubt Connie plugs her in the head at the end."
kartickjonty4,BigMac518,"Honestly, even if Sasha could have seen the future, and knew that sparing this kid would have led to her death, I think she still would have spared her."
kartickjonty4,uranthus,It may pay off for the Paradisans in the end. I feel like Gabi may have a change of heart and help their cause after spending time with them.
uranthus,aj12wedf,Yeah I feel that too but shes been force fed so much bullshit by the Marleyans that I dont think she would be able to change sides..

Gabi: *shocked Pikachu face* 

I'm really excited to see how Falco and Gabi process this. Falco said they were only getting revenge from what the warriors did to Paradisians first, and Gabi looked like she almost registered that but didn't want it to be right. 

Also the preview looks like we're going to get a flashback for the missing 4 years on the scout side so I'm exited about that."
sideofspread,ShaidarHaran2,"> and Gabi looked like she almost registered that but didn't want it to be right.

Soo is everyone who was big on Gabi still there, orr...  
 
I get the she's still a kid thing, but Falco fully grasped the cycle of violence already, Gabi was told the same thing but didn't want to process it, now Sasha's dead."
ShaidarHaran2,sideofspread,"We also have to remember, Falco was already against the idea of how Eldians are used in war. When he's on the train with Reiner he makes the comment ""Yeah she'll be a warrior, then she'll live to be 27 if she doesn't get killed in war first."" Falco already knows the whole thing is kind of bullshit, finding out the government has been lying to them this whole time is probably easier to grasp for him. 

But Gabi has her whole identity tied around becoming a warrior, wanting to make Eldians equal to everyone. Finding out she's been apart of a system the actively hinders what she feels like her her life's purpose is... hard. Its gonna take A LOT more for her than it does for Falco."
sideofspread,Redditer51,I should have known something was up. Zeke went down way too quick.
sideofspread,DGT-exe,"i hope the flashback means gabi will finally hear the full story. not like she'll get it, she's dense as a black fucking hole, but still."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tomas481516,Damn that fight between Eren & Reiner was incredible üëÄ
Tomas481516,Pardusco,"I expected it to last the whole episode lmfaooo

Reiner got rocked in like two seconds."
Pardusco,Soltan79,tbh hi didn't want to live let alone fight for his life.
Pardusco,GODKUBLACK88,Eren really pulled a ight imma head out after KOing Reiner
Pardusco,Eggishtrain,I knew they were going to have a short fight and Eren would just dip. I didn't expect it to be 30 seconds
Pardusco,madstork2,I‚Äôm actually glad this happened because it‚Äôs more realistic. Reiner was in literally no position to fight as he didn‚Äôt even want to live and he was already weak compared to Eren who has been shown to pretty much be the most powerful Titan atm
Tomas481516,pythagorium,"Serious question, why wouldn‚Äôt eren eat him or the jaw titan? I can‚Äôt imagine it would take that much more energy to grab their bodies and eat them before exiting??"
pythagorium,the_eddga,He said that he had no strength left. Makes sense because he transformed into a titan three times in a row since the fight started against the Warhammer
pythagorium,NZPengo2,"I don't think Reiner was fully out for the count in that moment. You see the Armored Titan's eyes ""deactivate"" only after Eren exited the Attack Titan.

I think they both had enough energy left to fight but it wasn't worth it. Eren said that he doesn't have energy left to beat Reiner and I think when Reiner saw that Eren was going to retreat he decided that he had succeeded in protecting the Jaw Titan."
pythagorium,VForceWave,"Eren not eating the jaw titan was probably because he didn't have enough time, it just looked sillier animated versus on a manga panel. Eren didn't pursue Reiner because he didn't want to kill Reiner. Eren obviously could've continued fighting, but made up that he was out of energy. Eren was shocked that Reiner went down in one hit, so out of respect for Reiner standing up after all of this to save his friend, Eren couldn't bring himself to kill someone who's the same as him. That's what I got out of it, at least."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KaMeLRo,"Bruh, Gabi survived many times just being a kid. If she were an adult and had a uniform, BAM!! a hole on the head by Sasha or since the war with middle east soldiers."
KaMeLRo,waltz4life,"True. Being a well trained, brainwashed child soldier makes her a valuable weapon against enemies that would hesitate to kill a kid."
waltz4life,ReallyColdMonkeys,"Yep, it's happened three times now."
waltz4life,SuspiciousDinner420,Mental note: Don't hesitate to kill kids.
KaMeLRo,Teves3D,Not eveeeeen. Shoot the fucking kid if she‚Äôs carrying an entire fucking RIFLE.
KaMeLRo,moroheus,"I think this is to show which side is the bad one. Paradis who refuse to shot children, or Marley who use them as soldiers.

Gabi is an eldia but she was brainwashed into thinking Marley are the good ones. If they get her to realize that it's better to be on the paradis side they can get all the eldias."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,"Sadly i was spoiled on this death by some ass hat dminng me spoilers, but thats the only one i saw, saying that this death still hit me hard. She was one of my favourite characters so im really sad. Also how the hell is Zeke involved in all this, i'm back to being confused while watching attack on titan and i love it."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,loveholic_99,"i was also spoiled about her death, many manga readers were ""dying"" to let everyone know about it. regardless i still cried about her death. she was one of my favourite characters. i feel bad seeing broken conny, he first lost his parents and now sasha."
loveholic_99,SuspiciousDinner420,I've watched Game of Thrones. As soon as Connie told Sasha and jean that they're important to him I knew one of them was going to die.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,ShadowDome,2nd time i got spoiled now on AoT also got spoiled on this death and on reiner berthold reveal i really fucking hate aot manga readers ( no offense to people who dont spoiler)
ShadowDome,Morningwood_10,I'm a manga reader and I hate others who spoil anime onlys
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,DemonicLemon02,In a similar boat though I've had a lot of things spoiled for me not just from that guy who was DMing everyone. Even though I was expecting her death I still feel hollow and I hope the show continues to give me feelings even though I already know a lot of things.
DemonicLemon02,MapTheJap,"Yeah he spoiled me too, but I didn't mind too much. The way I looked at those spoilers is that they were kinda predictable anyway. The reason I kept watching AoT was for the war/humanity studies in the psychology way, so it's still entertaining for me. Connie and Jeans reactions hurt more for me than her death itself.
EDIT: Of course, I don't want to be spoiled anymore than I already have"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Chungulungus,"Same, I kinda got spoiled after someone was hinting Sasha‚Äôs death (fuck those types of ppl btw), but her death was still unbelievable, like I still don‚Äôt want to believe it. My god she was one of my favorites, and to just get shot and killed like that was heartbreaking"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,DesolationJones,Got the same PM. I kind of vaguely knew already because of the random unjustified gabi hate in this place also semi spoiled it.  I put two and two together when she saw Sasha in the roof.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Pardusco,"Same here, but I didn't expect it to happen like this. Sasha was so dope :("
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,HarryDJ4,Really wtf so i was not the only one getting spoiled. Some people are the worst.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,hixpwarior3,He's got zekerets
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,sx-gabe,"BROOO SAMMMEE. 

Last week I was active on the aot community & I got dm‚Äôd. My ass thought ‚ÄúOH, it must be someone who wants to discuss something‚Äù. I opened it & I got spoiled 2 things >;(.

War hammer being eaten & Sasha being killed. 

However, I kinda expected the war hammer to be eaten so I wasn‚Äôt as bothered. 

& with the Sasha spoiler, I kinda knew she was going to be killed cuz of that one episode she shoots the 2 guards infront of Gabi which you can see in Gabis pupil Sashas face. so I was like maybe gabi is going to kill her...? 

But still, i would‚Äôve loved watching this episode without being spoiled. This episode hit me so imagine how hard it would‚Äôve hit me if I didn‚Äôt know it :,("
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,tfrosty,"I could tell from the previous episode‚Äù Eren Jaeger is not my enemy.‚Äù The literal Jesus pose to contrast Eren as the devil. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre running out of time Levi‚Äù. Everyone thinking he died. Seemingly intentionally missing when he threw the rocks. I‚Äôm always looking out for this kind of shit though. 

I think Reiner may switch sides too, or be forced to. I think it‚Äôs very apparent falco will take his Titan power. He remembered reiner‚Äôs memories in the first episode. And Reiner wants falco to have it, he‚Äôll give it him and falco will take it knowing Reiner is ready to die

I‚Äôm not spoiling anything, just making guesses."
tfrosty,uhohshesintrouble,Falco having those memories is major!!! Just don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôd have that memory before all of this...
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Lazybutt103,"I feel you, I was spoiled on her death couple years ago but damn the final scene still hurt a bunch"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,kiteruns,"I also got spoiled on this, but it was my only one as well so... equally confused as everyone else going forward. Yay"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,JESquirrel,I got you beat. A damn video with title of the character dying was recommended to me on youtube.
JESquirrel,Didomo,Same thing happened to me. Opened my YouTube and it was the first thing I saw and my soul left my body.  I haven‚Äôt checked my recommended tab since. :‚Äô(
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,samurairocketshark,"Got spoiled by fucking twitter having the character trending followed by ""Fans mourn the death of a beloved character."" Wasn't even checking my timeline just wanted to look at a specific tweet. Fuck twitter"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,ShaidarHaran2,"Yeah I was spoiled by probably the same DM. Those people must be near sociopaths, it's just an amazing show to enjoy in a sometimes shitty world. 

Oh did I say enjoy, I meant mildly crush my soul this episode, but still."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Twindo,Someone also DMmed me spoilers. It was like a long list of one sentence reveals in all caps. Thankfully I saw only the first two but this sucks because I was hoping the person made these up but after the first one got confirmed in this episode I know the second one must be true.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,rugia813,I also got spoiled... but at a forum about stock market... wth
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,DrBimboo,"Got spoiled on one of these threads here, by manga readers downvoting comments where i mentioned that i think she will die."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Cdntrooper19,Well I think zeke and eren are working together to let out all the titans in the walls bc erens sus
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,FishJesus_45,Some dick on tiktok spoiled it for me
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,saiful_458,Same
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,rumed01,also got the death spoiled probably by same person
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Sandshaker,The same thing happened to me. A random dm of spoilers from someone I don't know...like whyyyyyy
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,samgo88,ƒ± was also spoiled in sasha thing from dm and some stuppid manga readers came up with a theory that zeke gonna betray the marleyans what a  coincidence it became true
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,gomegantron,"Yeah, I don't trust Zeke at all. Once a traitor always a traitor."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Self_World_Future,"I was also spoiled, but then I saw the food war ova before this episode and I assure you, onions were being cut."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,eatyourmomdotcom,I saw a lot of people theorizing that zeke was behind all this cuz he was taken down to easily. I guess they were right lol
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,TheKrystalMethod0,"For me, it was spoiled via Twitter last week. Sasha Banks the wrestler had posted something vague that day and saw that SASHA was trending so I thought it was in regards to that. 

Nope, it was about Sasha and manga folks were posting the panels for Sasha‚Äôs death."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Aurum_MrBangs,Bro i got spiked by a fucking YouTube thumbnail.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Teves3D,Bro they should‚Äôve shut the fuck up. Sashas instincts are so fine but thought it was just Bavlo. I‚Äôm so fucking upset right holy shit. Seeing Eren show emotion was wild. Both laughing and then straight up depressed.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,StaticUncertainty,I couldn‚Äôt even remember who Sasha was to be honest. I need to rewatch more frequently
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Memegod_04,"I had a spoiler on YT, so I saw it coming. I was still upset"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,IITomTheBombII,"As did I, I've since disabled DMs until this season is over"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,LemonNitrate,"Same. I‚Äôm kinda glad that one of the spoilers happened in the very next episode, that way I don‚Äôt have to anticipate it"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Ashankura,Got spoiled aswell... I fucking hate the internet. Normally i wouldn't even look at this post but i cant suffer alone
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,justapotato9,Wtf i shall never open my dm anymore to protect myself
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,mihir_lavande,"They got him so they can have unlimited supply of Monke burger, just like Sasha would have wanted."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Lazy-_-Wolf,me too! but i was still like so stressed out just thinking of best girl dying
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,DrPikachu-PhD,"Same exact thing happened to me! What an asshole, but like you I managed to close the notification before I accidentally read anymore. Think this episode would've hit me a lot harder if I hadn't been spoiled, unfortunately."
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,ScionR,Man I'm hella sad that Sasha diedüò≠. But yeah I'm also confused in whatever plan is in play since Zeke is involved somehow.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,rajendraac_13,Don‚Äôt worry as long as you are not spoiled about storyline theres plenty of exciting and Wou moments coming. Just read the manga yesterday cause I got tired of spoilers. If you don‚Äôt want to be spoiled then you need to get off from social media. R/anime is the best place for discussion as they are very strict with hints and spoilers
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,oppsedopse,Yep same problem here but i only got spoiled for sashas death
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,El_Poky,I got it spoiled form a roblox game...Yeah you heard me right in roblox chat.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,DetectiveDeath,"I was spoiled by a friend who didn't watch the show but knew I did and sent a meme saying something like ""this (insert stupid thing) is so stupid that Sasha died"" and it showed her bleeding out on the floor. );"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Matttous,I was also spoiled by her death a long time ago because she is my favourite character and I used to always read about her and find out more
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,Masuia,I remember it got spoiled to me when I was watching season 3. I was just looking stuff up and accidentally saw her death marked on a wikia or something. Stopped watching for a few months till I forgot. Saw her the episode before this and I just knew this would be the one where she was gonna die. Still hurt all the same.
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,MJohnRili,"Also spoiled as I was scrolling through facebook one fine day, and then BAM outta nowhere this fucker just posted it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kartickjonty4,"Really liking Jean as a character now, he's come such a long way from season 1. 

I guess they all have."

KaMeLRo,korn96,I almost thought he kinda looked like Kenny lol. Especially when he was wearing that hat.
kartickjonty4,Housumestari,"Yeah I can't help but love Jean nowadays. To think I once saw him as arrogant and how damn mature he has become now. It's amazing ;\_\_; other charactes as well. It is bit like watching your own children grow.

I guess this is the good side about timeskips when done well. We get to see the characters to rapidly evolve."

amazingaida26,le_snikelfritz,"Of course her last word was ""Meat"" :'("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Im_a_Juice,why did sasha die WHY im so sad
Im_a_Juice,42MANl,"This is why I think Atack on Titan is so good, for showing how war terribly affects both sides, and like it only leads to negative emotions. I dont think Ive ever seen a story that handles war that well."
42MANl,GoldenSpermShower,To think this was a post-apocalyptic zombie story
42MANl,Q_Man_Group,"I read the manga up until this chapter I really thought Sasha's death was an injustice to her character. I guess I was mostly upset about the ""meat"" line. I thought a much more meaningful death or at least heart wrenching would have been something like Connie begging her to make it to the island for food and her going ""I'm not hungry.""

Idk I'm just butt hurt we lost her after all her development and that's all they gave her."
42MANl,Hawxe,I mean sure but the whole sequence with Gabi getting on the blimp was ridiculous
42MANl,Teves3D,Bro fuck wars and fuck gabi
42MANl,A_R_K_S,All Quiet On the Western Front imo does this kinda well
42MANl,chronoboy1985,"Yup. Having read a handful of books on European and Asian wars, the thing that sticks out like a sore thumb, is that successive wars are always linked to retribution for the last one. WW1 and 2 are obvious, but look at the endless list of wars between England and France. They were in an argument for 800 years trying to get the last word in!"
42MANl,WirelessShit,"Yes, but her death was just too forced, all deaths to this point had a ""real"" kinda felling, Sasha's was just a "" oh ye, it's aot we need to kill someone""
""Who we kill""
""Idk roll a dice""
""It's Sasha""
""Sasha? Why?""
""Idk lol"""
42MANl,chronoboy1985,"I can‚Äôt wait to see Gabi and Eren‚Äôs talk. And how quickly they realize that they‚Äôre the same. It‚Äôs gonna be waterworks for me, man. 

Gabi: *You monster! You killed Zofia and Udo and those nice guards and you ate Ms. Tybur!*

Eren: *Oh, yeah? Well you Marley assholes murdered nearly half the people on the island when the colossal dick and the Armored douche smashed a hole in wall Maria. Oh, and the cherry on top? I got to watch my mother get eaten by my dad‚Äôs first wife on my 10th birthday.

42MANl,Campo531,Band of Brothers. Highly recommend if you haven't seen it. Really shows the horror and heros of war
Im_a_Juice,YelpBoi365,Because Eren dragged the scouts into it
YelpBoi365,ATLSox87,Idk if you're just parroting Jean but everyone on Paradis was going to die if Marley was just left to its own devices
YelpBoi365,civeng1741,"No, it's because the scouts are dumbfucks and start partying before their last man even comes back. There's a big ass open door with a zip line sticking out to miles of enemy land. You're telling me they don't give a fuck and let down their guard? They don't have some way to watch what's underneath them in case they start getting attacked? 

Tldr: scouts are dumb"
Im_a_Juice,killertortilla,"I feel like I'd be a lot more sad if it wasn't the most contrived series of events. Gabby runs after everyone, the last guy stays behind, Gabby hits a 1 in a trillion shot while sliding, on a target's head, moving in 3 dimensions at once from that distance? **Fuck outta here.**

Then the line is just long enough for the blimp to keep moving, while Gabby gathers herself, picks up the controller, has a conversation, and then pulls herself up? **Fuck outta here x2.** 

Child Gabby somehow reloads her gun off screen, which means she loaded it in midair while pulling herself and the other kid up. Then pulls herself up and combat rolls into the blimp, and hits a perfect center mass shot? **Fuck outta here x3.**"
Im_a_Juice,Thevoidawaits_u,"She provided the funniest bit in TV history, I remember watching the show the first time with my brother then that bit came and I melted all over the floor laughing. 

During my boot camp, we were at order getting yelled at for weapon handling(Some dude fucked up at the shooting range). So the instructor put on a show of blubbering about weapon safety and yelling at that dude and then that potatoe scene flashed in my mind and I had to use all my will power to suppress my laughter, to no avail I got ""smoked""(to borrow an expression from American military)."
Im_a_Juice,IBreedAlpacas,"i was watching it thinking ""ok so they're just not gonna kill gabi, that'd just be cruel to shoot a child plus I wanna see where it goes"" into ""YOOOO FUCK GABI UP WHAT THE FUCK YOU DON'T KILL SASHA"""
Im_a_Juice,lightningpresto,The editor saved her by crying and Isayama took pity and spared her in Season 2 only for him to have her get hit by shrapnel end of Season 3 and then die anyways here... We are all that editor now

Myster_Carter,sometricksupmysleeve,She probably targeted her specifically
Im_a_Juice,JooK8,I can't remember the last time I cried.  Almost cried when Sasha died.
Im_a_Juice,Wolf_Doggie,How could they kill off the shows mascot like that? :(
Im_a_Juice,ElectroHail,"Cause the author noticed no main characters have died in a while and picked sashas name out of a hat probably, then wrote the dumbest shit possible which led to her dying"
ElectroHail,MrBlqckBird242,How is it dumb?
ElectroHail,42MANl,"Every single member of the 104th cadet corps with a lot of screen time does something important to the plot or has an interesting theme attached to them. Sasha was the only one who could be taken out  not really change the plot  at all. However she's a really likeable character who everyone enjoys from the very first time she's introduced.

 I believe this is all because she was meant to die and make us feel sad to help show that war hurts everyone involved, not just the enemies."
Im_a_Juice,evan1932,"IMO I‚Äôm glad it was Sasha and not Levi or Armin or one of the other main characters. I always thought of Sasha as an annoying and goofy side character that was thrown in mainly for comedic relief.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,instantlyforgettable,What‚Äôs the endgame here? Is it just revenge or is it to ultimately bring the Titans under the control of a select few that won‚Äôt use them for conflict anymore? Surely the aim can‚Äôt be to wage war on the world.
instantlyforgettable,tryagainyesterday,"The thing I‚Äôm most curious about is Zeke‚Äôs angle. He‚Äôs been so loyal to Marley his whole life (to the point of selling out his own parents), so it feels weird he would be willing to betray Marley to make peace."
tryagainyesterday,NoobyDooo,"I feel like it was all part of a bigger plan. Maybe the owl planned on Zeke selling out his parents so he could make Grisha the Attack Titan and send him to Paradis. Moreover, this would prove Zeke's utter loyalty to Marley so they would never doubt him. Perhaps he was against them all along."
tryagainyesterday,x_TDeck_x,"I rewatched Season 3 recently and there was a scene where he was chucking rocks and he got really angry seemingly because of how the people on the island were treated.


Paraphrasing it was something like ""That damn king wiping your memories so you're doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over"" then he gets so mad he crushes a rock into dust.


So maybe he feels some pity for the island? Or started to think Marley was doing something wrong?"
tryagainyesterday,zelin11,"Zeke sold out his parents because he thought they were evil. What could've happened is that Eren shared his father's memories with Zeke because in S3 we learned that he can control the powers of the Founding Titan if he was touching another titan of royal blood. Or maybe Zeke has his own plans, heck knows."
tryagainyesterday,AAABattery03,"We should note that we‚Äôve only received the Grisha side of the Zeke betrayal story. 

If you look at how Annie, Reiner, and Bertholdt have grown on us as characters since the first time their betrayal was revealed, it‚Äôs pretty clear that this story is written in a way that everyone feels they‚Äôre making the best decision, given the information they have. 

I‚Äôm sure Zeke‚Äôs angle won‚Äôt be weird at all once it‚Äôs explored."
instantlyforgettable,xabregas2003,"I think they might be looking for conquest and expansion. 

One of the soldiers literally says:

>The new Eldian empire's first battle has ended with a huge victory."
instantlyforgettable,Serbaayuu,"For Paradis, I assume it is to secure independence in such a way that nobody can torment them the way Marley has done for a century.

For the series, I can't see any ending other than somehow ""Titans no longer exist"".  Maybe if someone eats all 9 they can just get rid of it or something?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZzzZandra,"Anyone noticed they reanimated the flashbacks to Sasha instead of using previous footage?

edit; copying from my reply below.

I think it's because the original footage was a bit off the seriousness of the situation. [Sasha was drooling, giggling, and looked strangely turned on in the original one.](https://pm1.narvii.com/5856/bec319650493cb8f846388b04457e802f8609619_00.jpg) And oddly enough the only scene showing her sharing food.

ZzzZandra,_th3on3andonly_,"It is crazy how much detail and work they put in every episode. Every week I am like its impossible that the new episode will hold up to the high expactations set by the previous part of the season but they exceed my expectations every time.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dogenroll,I was spoiled about Sasha's death but I still cried :(
dogenroll,IGotchaYou,"Same. I was sent DM full of spoilers that vanished without my opening it. It was in capslock, so when I got notified, I could read #GabiKilledSasha clearly. What joy do people get from doing this?"
IGotchaYou,nigelfitz,Same shit when Snape killed blah blah... just for the memes.
IGotchaYou,ShaidarHaran2,"I would guess that these people feel powerless in their real lives and take what control they have on the internet. Sucks that we got spoiled, but at least we're not that sad."
dogenroll,TheSilentGamer33,I saw her death coming and was still crying.
TheSilentGamer33,Disabled_Robot,"Yeah, the Sasha and Zeke parts were fairly transparent,

Still wondering who Yelena is and how long Zeke's sympathies to Paradis really go back.

I complain about it every week, but the episodes are too damn short. :'("
dogenroll,DemonicLemon02,Saaaame üò≠üò≠
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,majurz,"This is getting so fucking interesting now. I had a feeling zeke would be alive and an ally. I loved that Eren actually got worked up by Sashas death. It shows that he at least has some feelings left. 

Idk if it was the right decision. On one hand they're probably gonna be hunted down now by everyone nation. On the other hand marley already declared war, so its was a good preemptive strike to get the warhammer titan.

I wish I'd just waited till all the episodes are out now. The waiting is killing me."
majurz,michauduong,Haha i was so worried that he‚Äôs going to start laughing or sth after hearing about Sasha‚Äôs death. Glad it was the opposite reaction
michauduong,loveholic_99,"he did sound like he was laughing at first, i was so surprised."
michauduong,MacaqueAphrodisiaque,"I mean, he was laughing. It was nervous, but still laughter."
majurz,zelin11,"> Idk if it was the right decision. On one hand they're probably gonna be hunted down now by everyone nation.

That was gonna happen either way because of Tybur's speech."
majurz,MdelinQ,"Here's a lil theory - I don't think Eren got worked up because of Sasha's death.

He asked ""what were her last words?"" When they told him it was ""meat"", he made a very similiar face to the one when he kissed Historia's hand in the end of season 3.

I think Eren knows everything that is going to happen, and Sasha's last words are just another confirmation for him."
majurz,emnozz,I was glad to see Mikasa mourn Sasha too. Nice to see her care about something other than Eren.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pardusco,"Noooooooooooo!!!!!!!

Good grief, I had chills throughout this entire episode. Damn it, why did Sasha of all people have to die! I was so excited to see more of her :(

I think these events will turn the Paradisians into more cold blooded killers. Even kids cannot be spared.

There is obviously a lot of beef between the Paradisians, due to Eren's actions and the addition of Zeke and his followers. My theory is that Zeke sent these people aboard the scout ships to inform Paradis of his wish to work together. And I knew that the bearded soldier was shady! They focused on the back of her hair for some reason, so there had to be some deeper purpose behind it. Pieck is incredibly observant for noticing that!

I really did not expect Reiner to get ohkoed. I thought this battle was going to be a long battle, but Eren is clearly more skilled.

Edit: I'll list the evidence that Zeke was a traitor.

""Not in this room.""

The baseball that he gave to Eren. Eren said that a friend thought he was bored and gave it to him.

The bearded soldier ""Yelena"" sent him away before trapping Porco and Pieck.

Levi's watch and ""you're almost out of time.""

We didn't see Zeke's body when Levi fucked him up.

Any thing else that I didn't notice?"
Pardusco,Vegan_Thenn,Zeke also told Reiner to go ahead and follow Falco before the theatrics were set to start.
Pardusco,JingleFett,"Zeke also mentioned something about Falco's brother learning his ""big secret"" once he inherits the beast titan, although he made a joke of it by saying it was about how he wipes his butt when he goes to the bathroom"
Pardusco,Dovaldo83,">I really did not expect Reiner to get ohkoed. I thought this battle was going to be a long battle, but Eren is clearly more skilled.

I wasn't either. It would seem Eren could have gotten both the Jaw and Armor titan then and there with minimal effort.

I feel this was primarily written so to set up future events, but something Falco said about Reiner in a previous episode stood out to me: that a titan's ability to live and fight is tied to their will. Eren's will is one of his defining features. It would help explain why he was able to discard his titan body and re-summon it multiple times while the warhammer titan became expended doing so."
Dovaldo83,TheGuyWhoReallyCares,"Minimal effort is a stretch. Eren is actually brilliant in S4, and he knows he has reached his limit. He had transformed 3 times, and he knew that if Reiner put in his strength, he might not win. Eren probably could not transform again, so acquiring the war hammer wasn't immediately useful. Plus I don't think he had to heart to kill Reiner, that is why he decided to call it a day"
Pardusco,UsuallyParrot,Levi talking about his improv and them talking about acting about killing him shows that they are colluding to a pretty big degree
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Prof_Black,"I was expecting Jean & Connie to react the way Armin and Mikasa did. 

That was gut wrenching. The tears on the dead face."
Prof_Black,merlemi,"They were in shock, which is even more heartbreaking"
Prof_Black,dame-24,Connie‚Äôs reaction spoke volumes. A reaction like Mikasa‚Äôs or Armin‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt have been as loud as his under-reaction.
dame-24,LikeMike04,"I feel so bad for Conny honestly. Right when he dropped a tear, I started crying"
Prof_Black,AAABattery03,Jean‚Äôs reaction hurt me the most. He obviously hates Gabi but doesn‚Äôt want to give in to it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,"i love the consistency in sasha's character, she was always the fastest to notice noise (ex: when titans appeared in wall rose) but too bad she didn't take it seriously.

i was crying when she was dying but i couldn't help but giggle when she mentionned meat. damn you sasha, you make sure to make us laugh even in your worst moment.

poor conny though, lost his parents and now sasha. mikasa though, even if she looked tough to her before she seemed to truely care about her."
loveholic_99,AAABattery03,"I feel like Mikasa gets the short end of the stick with this stuff because so much of her personality is focused on her obvious crush on Eren. 

Then every once in a while you see her reactions to stuff like Armin‚Äôs presumed death back in S3, Sasha‚Äôs death, etc and it just hurts your soul..."
loveholic_99,cleaninglist,Remembering Mikasa's and Armin's reactions is making me cry again
loveholic_99,Teves3D,"They paired up often. The first two to storm HQ in Trost. And again when they were guarding the female titan from other titans. She trusts Sasha, so sad."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dimmadeezy,"Connie: At least we all made it out alive

Sasha: hold my potato"
Dimmadeezy,amazingaida26,too soon
amazingaida26,crimsonphoenix12,"I know it should be funny, but it really is too soon :("
Dimmadeezy,nariz1234,Connie didn't watch Konosuba.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gm1504,Her death was so devastating.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kartickjonty4,So is Armin the hottest chick on the show now?
kartickjonty4,SadegB,always has been
SadegB,Mr_Dr_Prof_Patrick,üî´
kartickjonty4,Miriaaaam,"Also Jean, always had a weak spot"
kartickjonty4,rocket-alpha,Armin has always been best girl
kartickjonty4,42MANl,yes
kartickjonty4,Fayruzz,"No no, Armeen."
Fayruzz,HowardTheHowitzer,I can only think of Reiner having a total Chad personality now
kartickjonty4,GladiatorMainOP,"Lies, hange still lives. Unfortunately I am not a titan so I can never be loved by her."
TimoorBTS,Pardusco,Floch was right. They should have just tossed her off the ship or maybe use her as shark bait.
TimoorBTS,_swishnflick_,"Also, Sasha looked so asdffjebshdtagdg pretty in this episode"
TimoorBTS,DimensionCautious341,"fuck gabi, she never even questioned why the ""devils of paridise island"" were bad. fuck her"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MacabreMiasma,"All the hints were there. The baseball and pitching glove. Zeke leaving Galliard and Pieck that easily. Him getting one shot. All leads up to this. 

Interesting that Lobov made that point about the Garrison not mattering anymore. Very interested to see what it‚Äôs like back on Paradis now. 

Sasha dying sucked but it was expected. Should cause a further wedge in the already existing schism amongst the scouts. Hange made a great point about them always having to save him and it happened again. 

Eren‚Äôs reaction is scary and sad. I thought he wouldn‚Äôt have much of one but the look on his face said a lot. I also really like how Jean‚Äôs character developed into being the moral center of the show. 

Really interested in seeing how things develop from now on."
MacabreMiasma,jellyfishjumpingmtn,"I so called this in the last thread lol, but I was still surprised that I was right about Zeke. 

Sashas death was just so sad... she had nothing to eat.. I think Eren was broken in grief remembering the other time that Sasha had meat and it was spoiled by the Colossal titan's appearance and the attack on the wall."
jellyfishjumpingmtn,IBreedAlpacas,"I remember reading the thread and people were pointing out that it may have been a misleading Chekhov's gun. I went back and watched it and thought that it was either 1. Eren assimilating into the Marley culture and gaining perspective on them or 2. Zeke and Eren working together.

Yeah both came true fuck lmfao"
MacabreMiasma,PhatDib,I think lobov meant that there‚Äôs no more titans to defend against so the garrison has nothing left to do
MacabreMiasma,NFLAddict,how is baseball a hint. a hint for what. am i an idiot
MacabreMiasma,Crazed_Archivist,I guess that Paradis would have to reform its entire military structure no? Garrison would either be merged with the Scouts or turned into some sort of National Guard and Navy to defende the country¬¥s borders
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdeQ217,"I really like how Jean remains the reasonable one who hates war and everything about it, nice to see that some people don't change. I'm  hyped about what's going on with Zeke. I knew that someone was going to die because of the episode's title and when Gabi mentioned Sasha I knew who was the one to die but it still hit me hard."
AdeQ217,emnozz,Armin hates it just as much but is too sad to even say anything :( he hates being a killing machine and he‚Äôs not even there with his clever plans anymore.
emnozz,AAABattery03,"In hindsight, Eren‚Äôs decision to force Levy to revive Armin was... really selfish. You took your clever, strategically minded friend who has always hated fighting and killing and... made him into a nuke..? 

For whatever it‚Äôs worth though, his clever plans aren‚Äôt gone, they‚Äôve just been offscreen so far this season. Hange was pretty clear last episode that the planning with the lights and airship was all Armin. Hopefully they on-screen his plans later in this season!"
emnozz,SurealGod,"Well, actually Hange asked Armin if he was possessed by Erwin because this plan is insane, implying that Armin was the one who orchestrated this entire thing; though doubt Eren killing civilians was part of his plan."
AdeQ217,Garbycol,On the other hand I hate to see Floch is now the Gabi of the Paradisers
instantlyforgettable,LordSprinkleman,"Yes, exactly."
sideofspread,worstluckbrian,"Elidian restoration? I noticed when they were all cheering, they called themselves New Eldian something. I think that's the first time I've heard them refer to themselves with something other than humanity."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jat616,Rest in potato Sasha üíî
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DemonicLemon02,I got spoiled...I knew she was going to die this episode and yet I am still in so much pain
DemonicLemon02,le_snikelfritz,"Same. didn't know exactly how though so everytime she was onscreen, I was waiting for a bullet to hit her outta nowhere"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,haariitthh,Imagine being those two annoying ass kids and going all the way TO BOARD A ZEPPELIN AND KILL SASHA just to find out their lord and savior Zeke is a double agent üòÇ
haariitthh,iplay2manyvideogames,And for him to call them ‚Äúmiscalculations‚Äù
haariitthh,Teves3D,"That‚Äôs what the get, those assholes deprived Sasha of meat. A cardinal sin."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,instantclassico,"Why did it have to be in her stomach of all places?!

Edit: Lung* but still a brutal way to go"
instantclassico,Hellindium,I thought she was shot in her left lung.....above the stomach for sure....otherwise she could have survived.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CapnEggshell,"The soundtrack to her death was phenomenal, plus they‚Äôre doing such a good job with Gabi, I haven‚Äôt met a single person who liked her, but she‚Äôs still a great character, even though we all collectively agree she deserved that beating 10x over"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,"gabi was really like ""didn't see it so i didn't happen"" when falco used his brain analysing the situation."
loveholic_99,waltz4life,The irony of it is that she continued to believe that the island devils were evil despite never having seen any of the supposed evil things they did. But I guess now that she's experiencing it first hand it just solidifies her beliefs
waltz4life,cuhhcr,">despite never having seen any of the supposed evil things they did.

I'll take ""killed my friends but fuck them since they're the enemy I guess""  for 800$"
loveholic_99,AnimusFoster748,"It's almost as if Falco understands, because he legit witnessed two people from opposite sides discuss about just how similar they are."
AnimusFoster748,Cammibird,"Even if Gabi had seen that conversation, I still don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd have *got it* the way Falco does. She would have just thought Eren was lying or something, and she definitely wouldn‚Äôt have understood why Reiner was throwing himself at Eren‚Äôs feet. 

Falco on the other hand understood the true horror of war better than any of the other warrior candidates, even before all of this happened. Remember, he was the only one who tried to help the injured enemy soldier back in episode 1."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bootymunchcrunch,somebody told me this would happen but i didn‚Äôt believe it because when i started the show and told some people i liked sasha they said she died but by the time i caught up she was still there. i didn‚Äôt want to believe she would actually die in season 4. i thought gabi was a little overhated but i would‚Äôve thrown her off the ship immediately
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nenkha29,"Hoped until the end that out of everyone Sasha wouldn‚Äòt die but i guess it had to be her, after she let Gabi live.. so sad but i couldn‚Äòt help but smile that her last words were about meat.

After my [findings](https://www.reddit.com/r/attackontitan/comments/l42oc2/attack_on_titan_season_4_episode_7_assault_anime/gkmz4p8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) last week i was so hyped when i saw and heard the sound of a titan besides Eren healing on the ship. I can‚Äòt fucking wait to hear about Zekes story!

As someone was commenting last week: Double agent, baby!!

Was a bit disappointed that the fight between Eren and Reiner didn‚Äòt happen. He would‚Äôve easily won! But i guess it was time for Paradis to lose someone after these last weeks full of hype."
nenkha29,uranthus,"I don't think he wanted to fight, he doesn't have the spirit for it anymore. He just wanted to rescue the Jaw titan before it got eaten also."
nenkha29,Proctolicious,"Damn, that theory you posted last week about the owl is fascinating. But as someone else mentioned, it‚Äôd be pretty wild for that to be true considering how much pleasure Zeke seemed to take in slaughtering the scouts in season 3. So I‚Äôm inclined to think that his turn happened after that, I have no idea what could justify it for him other than the owl though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hapiscan,Did anyone else felt like Armin was kind of mad at Eren? And Eren expected it.
hapiscan,caphesuadaa,I mean Eren is the reason that Armin got pushed into the role of the colossal titan which involvs killing thousands of people. Some resentment on Armins side is very understandable
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chasseur_OFRT,"So sad, Sasha is the representation of the innocent in times of war, they want so little but even that is denied.

It may be controversial, but that is why in war you cannot have mercy, at least not if you want to live, because this world is cruel just like Berthold said.

Too bad I got the spoiler of that death on the way to watch the EP, these guys sucks.

 And Falco is getting better and better, it's like he's a mix of the best parts of Eren and Reiner."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,skyrule,"Bravo to that one asshole who spoiled Sasha's death while writing ""HAHAHAHAHAHA"" along with other spoilers I can't remember as a reply to a comment I made in the previous episode discussion thread. Now I had no emotion going into this one. Fucking asshole. I just don't understand what pleasure it gives to these people."
skyrule,Grayox,They are sociopaths
Grayox,Nearby-County7333,"they truly are. i remember watching a tiktok and someone commented a question and asked for no spoilers and even said that they were on s1 and some rando came in and spoiled sasha‚Äôs death, even for me too. this was back in november too. it‚Äôs insane to me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ship_enthusiast,I understand where Gabi is coming from but damn...should‚Äôve killed Floch instead of Sasha üò≠üò≠
ship_enthusiast,Resh_IX,For real lol
ship_enthusiast,starwaver,Yeah! And then no one would've cared and Gabi won't garner so much hate
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingFXCan,"Because of Eren they got Warhammer powers, Zeke, destroyed Marley port, death of Tybur and other high ranked Marleyans and they beat up all warriors.

But 8 people died -> Hange: We can't trust you anymore.

Because of Erwin they lost half of the scouts everytime.

-> All scouts: In Erwin we trust!!!"
KingFXCan,kartickjonty4," Eren forced them to fight and start a war on his own, by putting himself and the founding Titan in danger leading to the deaths of countless innocents. Erwin never forced anyone to do anything, he inspired them."
kartickjonty4,majurz,"This whole siltation really begs the question ""How would Erwin  have done it?"". Would he have given a grand speech of how they have to sacrifice civilians for the greater good? Idk but i think the plan Eren/Zeke came up with wouldn't be completely out of question for Erwin.

EDIT: As much as I like Armin, the decision to save him instead of Erwin might cost them in the end."
kartickjonty4,GoldenSpermShower,"Yeah if anything went wrong Marley would have had the Founding Titan, the most valuable thing for both sides"
kartickjonty4,iRox14,"I mostly agree, but the war would've started regardless of Eren. The only thing Eren did was strike first, instead of waiting to be attacked"
kartickjonty4,nigelfitz,"They were gonna go to war regardless. Shit, he ate the dude that literally just declared war at them.

They gained some advantage doing what they did and I think that's a ballsy move by Eren."
KingFXCan,Soltan79,just another day for the survey corps
KingFXCan,DelphiCapital,"To be fair, 8 died and many more were probably seriously injured."
KingFXCan,zelin11,"> But 8 people died -> Hange: We can't trust you anymore.

Don't forget they were forced to kill many innocent civilians, which Hange and Levi definitely do not feel well doing. And what the other commenter said about Erwin not forcing anyone but instead inspiring."
KingFXCan,P3WPEWRESEARCH,"Hange not mad, she‚Äôs just disappointed"
KingFXCan,Garou-kun,"Eren literally just pissed off the entire world with many nations having advanced technology that even troubled Titan shifters. I bet they were trying to figure out if there was ways they could make peace. 

Erwin‚Äôs actions were to drive back the invaders while Eren did what the titans have been doing almost his entire life"
KingFXCan,ForShotgun,They didn't like being forced to do it
KingFXCan,AcousticAtlas,Erwin never forced anyone to sacrifice themselves. Because of Eren all of paradis and the scouts lives are forfeit. Not exactly comparable.
KingFXCan,Renousim3,Getting the entire world to come against you by killing their diplomats and forcing the scouts to come to your aid vs inspiring people
Renousim3,RetroAcorn,"These are the same to me, also I have a smooth brain"
KingFXCan,cgoodies5,Do feel like the scouts and paradis are kinda overlooking the fact that Willy Tybur was in the middle of declaring war on paradis and asking the world to join.
cgoodies5,xose94,"Except that Eren didn't only attack Marley He attacked a lot of other nations too some of them nations that could have been neutral or despised Marley enough to even side with paradis. Let's remember that the season starts with Marley at war with another country.
Let's also remember that Willy and the military knew that they were infiltrated and that they would be attacked. In one point Willy even said that he would probably die that night. Eren (and possibly Zeke) did everything Willy and the army wanted them to do. The only real win they probably had is the Warhammer titan but even then we know that other countries had developed anti-titan weaponry, technology that the marleys didn't have (they recognized that they had put too much trust in the titans meanwhile the other countries tried to outpass them technologically. Now those other countries will side with Marley because the eldians killed their diplomats and nobility."
KingFXCan,darkmarineblue,Yeah because forcing your friends and comrades to fight and die for you(again) by simply throwing their only hope into the enemy's mouth is the same as inspiring the soldiers under your command to fight from a position they agreed to give you and let you keep.
KingFXCan,Rocketbird,It‚Äôs not about results it‚Äôs about chain of command and getting everyone onboard with the plan. Eren acted as a rogue agent and people died for a plan they hadn‚Äôt agreed to execute.
KingFXCan,Dinokng,"It‚Äôs all about how the scouts are put into the situations though. 

Erens attack was massively successful but he forced the scouts into it. It they hadn‚Äôt have come then he would have been captured or killed. 

With Erwin he inspired them to follow him, he never forced them."
KingFXCan,kinbeat,"Key difference is that erwin was the commander, what he did was withing his powers, while eren pretty much deserted and forced the military to put up a whole operation to bring him back."
KingFXCan,Deadowl96,"Yeah but there's a difference between a commander like Erwin, making a strategic plan to attack enemy combatants, while keeping at least his subordinates like Hange and Levi in the loop. Eren on the otherwise basically forced the hand of his superior officers, to carry out an attack on civilians. Sure the scouts only lost 8 people, but it could have been a lot worse, they couldn't know for sure Zeke wouldn't double cross them, they couldn't have been sure that Armin's nerve would hold in killing all those people, and couldn't have been a 100% sure on how prepared Marley would have been."
KingFXCan,Native136,"To be fair, paradise might have been in communication with the other nations before Eren went rogue."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,willworkforabreak,"Now this, I like. So, I think the most interesting thing about this episode is how they've hammered home the fact that paradis Island just pissed off the entire world. This obviously has a lot of implications, not the least of which is the battle to come, but what's more interesting than that is that they will never be left alone again. Basically the only path they can take is to become an imperial power and enter into an almost never ending war, just like Marley had.

Now, tie all of that together with Sasha. All she wanted was to reclaim her farmland so that she could enjoy delicious food and a peaceful life. That peace will never come to the eldians of paradis island, and Sasha has shown us how terrible war can be. 

This final season is really knocking it out of the park. What a brilliant tragedy. What an interesting focus for the show. I love how each season slowly progressed towards this as the focus was taken farther and farther away from the titans, and towards intelligent humans who just couldn't survive in tandem."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chipthehippie,"Connie coming in, stone faced, with that stream of tears, just hit so hard. They did SUCH a good job embodying Sasha's personality and comic relief in her final moments, and portraying everyone's emotion to her death.

MAPPA is absolutely KILLING IT with this season. There is no doubt about it. I'm glad all of the brats have shut up about the CGI for the most part and have begun actually enjoying the emotion that the show brings.

Edit: Come on guys, I'm obviously talking about the super hate about the CGI, not just general and honest criticism. There's always room for criticism, but I'm simply saying I'm glad the brats who come in and shout ""MAPPA ruined AOT with CGI!"" are more are less gone from the sub."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the_heff,"Hold up, did Eren have  that baseball glove outside the hospital because he was playing catch with Zeke?"
the_heff,josesito21,I think it was foreshadowing. Really good one too.
the_heff,TottenhamAreShit21,It‚Äôs extremely wholesome imagining the two of them playing catch lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TimoorBTS,"Gabi why ffsüòû why sashaüòûüòû im fucking sad...

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MidSolo,The question still remains; where the fuck is Annie?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tryagainyesterday,It‚Äôs 854 and Floch is still annoying as fuck

Parmesean118,Jack1066,By far one of the most believable characters on the show

hes1nutted,Aadil279,"Yeah, fuck Floch"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OGFN_Jack,"Just want to put it out there that you‚Äôre not superior because you read the manga. Please stop replying to posts with things that give obvious hints away thinking you‚Äôre a fucking genius for saying something cryptic without spoiling it. Were not all 12 years old. When you guys comment on posts last week about how much we hate Gabi with ‚Äúyou‚Äôll hate her so much more this week‚Äù I can pretty easily deduce she does something to one of the main characters contrary to what your massive brain thinks. When you make the effort to not blatantly spoil the shot, but instead comment quips that allude to certain things happen all it does it make it obvious that you want to spoil the show but phrase it in a way that makes you ‚Äúcool‚Äù and ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù. Just cut it out."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lord_mush,At least it wasn't a titan and she was surrounded by friends
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ekaleli,"this was a really good episode, brought the huge W with Zeke being revealed as a double agent but also brought huge sadness with Sasha‚Äôs death. As much as i hate waiting, weekly episodes make these moments so much more entertaining simply because of the hype."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DelphiCapital,How are you guys able to watch the new episode already before 12:45 PT?
DelphiCapital,nenkha29,In germany it‚Äòs airing at 09:34 PT

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Seitto,"Why the fuck does gabi have god tier aim, this bitch be sliding while doing a 360 no scope as an 8 year old and still hit the guy 3 miles away."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SexyDuckDocumentary,"I kind of understand the scouts hating on Eren for forcing them to get involved but it doesn't seem like they're seeing the big picture. The non-eldian forces were going to gang up on Paradis anyways and now they have crippled Marley and can activate the founding titan.

Also so HYPED to see the founding titan in action!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,itsmebhure,words can't quantify my hate for gabi
itsmebhure,Prof_Black,But Falco did not deserve the beating. Poor lad always getting dragged into shit.
Prof_Black,Hellindium,I don't want Falco to die....he's a good kid....
Prof_Black,Asgbjj,I was shocked when Falco grabbed Gabi
Prof_Black,mekoomi,"I really like him, he sees both sides of the war even tho he was brainwashed all his life"
itsmebhure,Sarazan97,Best part of the episode was when the survey corp beat the shit out of her. Also the look on her face when she saw Zeke was priceless.
Sarazan97,DimensionCautious341,"what was zeke doing, im really confused"
Sarazan97,Pardusco,She got off light. Gabi deserves worse. At least Falco can see the bigger picture.
Sarazan97,itsmebhure,fr bro rewatched that part twice or thrice
Sarazan97,Blitz_Prime,">Best part of the episode was when the survey corp beat the shit out of her.

Calm sane man says about a 12 year old."
itsmebhure,Timbishop123,Lol the entire point of s4 is to show grey morality in war. In Gabis eyes killing Sasha was justified.
itsmebhure,42MANl,Am I the only one that likes Gabi? Just because you root for/ like a character who takes damage or dies from an antagonist doesn't mean you cant enjoy the antagonist from their perspective
42MANl,Sarazan97,"What's there to like in Gabi? She wants to kill the Paradis people just because she was told to. Falco on the other hand understands their reasons and that they lived for a century in that hellhole

Only thing I get from Gabi is big NPC energy"
42MANl,nenkha29,"Even when we forget about the last 3 seasons with the guys from Paradis. I just can‚Äòt stand her. She‚Äòs so unreasonable unlike Falco. He‚Äòs not that brainwashed, thinks for himself, shows empathy. Gabi is just soo annoying"
42MANl,Kevinc62,I also really like Gabi and what Isayama has done with her. She is basically non-titan Eren and she is used to exemplify the circle of violence theme.
42MANl,Poignant_Porpoise,"I don't really see what her redeeming qualities as a person are(?) She's extremely arrogant, she is generally rude and dismissive of the people around her, she's not smart enough to question any of the falsehoods that she's been taught, she's angry and impulsive etc. What positive traits has she exhibited so far other than being a good soldier?"
42MANl,Nearby-County7333,"i honestly agree with u. it‚Äôs kinda annoying to see people hate on her so much when eren was quite literally the same. i dont love her but i get her perspective. seemingly it‚Äôs ok when eren acts that way but not gabi. i mean yes she did kill a favorite and i probably won‚Äôt ever forgive her for that, but she‚Äôs literally the same as eren."
42MANl,itsmebhure,"There is literally no difference in the upbringing of Gabi and Falco. Same academy, same training same education, and yet when falco tried to explain her how paradis folks got massacred she still actively chose to be brainwashed. I respect your opinion but it is what it is"
itsmebhure,bootywizard42O,She's just a kid who was brainwashed to hate Paradis. If anything this episode made her more likeable when she reveals her motivations for working so hard. She just wants to make her people proud and change people's perceptions of Eldians. She doesn't have the same info or perspectives that Falco or Reiner have had.
bootywizard42O,merlemi,"You nailed it. I don't understand the Gabi hate - Sasha was one of my favorite characters and I cried my eyes out a few hours ago. But even Jean and Connie understood that Gabi didn't kill Sasha because she is evil... She killed her because they just destroyed her home and killed some very important people for her. Her friends, her role models. She's just a brainwashed kid."
bootywizard42O,asiabear,"I think that we, as the viewers, are also brain washed by the first three seasons as much as Gabby and crew are. We see the people of Paradis grow, change and bond. We experience their love, confusion, loss and hate right along side them. You are rooting against the Marleyan Eldians before you even see the ""actual Marleyans"" when the scouts are fighting the ""titan devils."" Then suddenly we're introduced to a whole new set of characters that we've only known for 8 episodes and think ""these people are terrible, they don't know what they're doing, Gabby is so bull headed."" We get these snippets of her thoughts and personality, and you see those reflections of Eren in the cracks, but the viewer can turn a blind eye to those struggles because weve seen so much more of her anti-paradis brainwashing against the characters we love."
itsmebhure,Practicalaviationcat,"I understand her POV and why she did what she did, but she kept going on about the ""devils of Paradis"". I know she is a brainwashed kid; it's just tough to get past that. People always talk about the parallels she has to Eren, but right now she has a lot of parallels to Floch. I hope she gets some perspective on Paradis and at least understands that her enemies are regular old humans just like her and her friends(I.E. where Eren is right now).

edit: also Gabi called Paradis a threat to world peace. Fucking rich coming from someone fighting for Marley."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NickBooms,"I had this idea in my head after the conversation between Eren and Reiner for ""Declaration of War"" but after this episode with conversations between Falco and Gabi along with Eren and Levi it is now certain: this show is great. I know this is an obvious statement but here me out.

I became a big fan of Game of Thrones and one thing that always stood out is that you cared about the conversations just as much, if not more than, the combat. There was no filler because each scene just added another brick to the path the story was following. Not only that, but you always felt excited when two characters who you know well finally meet, whether it's their first time meeting or it's a long-awaited reunion. 

AOT has become just that. The back-and-forth dialogue between Eren and Reiner showed the regrets Reiner still has along with the undying rage Eren feels. Falco telling Gabi the true reason why their friends died and her ignoring this information shows a dark path in her future if left unchanged. Levi scolding Eren while also filling the viewers in on the fact that no one wanted this to happen leaves even more room for conflict. At this point I don't care if there's an epic showdown, what I want to see is a genuine debate between Eren and Gabi and hopefully a revelation showing that they're really two sides of the same coin. That is why I think this show is great, and it's been a while since I've felt that way about any of the shows I've watched in the past few years."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bruhbeanhead,Floch was so annoying in this episode. Hey they could‚Äôve almost saved Sasha by checking that noise but floch said CHeEr LoUDer

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daroons,All I have to say is [https://youtu.be/RMPRH\_4lhHw?start=37&end=43](https://youtu.be/RMPRH_4lhHw?start=37&end=43)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wing_Fish1302,"I don't usually post on this subreddit (Or Reddit in general), so I preemptively apologize if I make any mistakes. I just wanted to dump my thoughts here.

Haha, what an episode. I put it up there with 'Declaration of War' for favorite episodes of this season. I loved the adrenaline rush of the last few episodes, but episodes like this really make me stick around AoT/SnK. If anything, these types of episodes enhance the action for me.

Unfortunately, I got spoiled on Sasha's death a while back, so it didn't hit as hard, but it was still sad, especially on re-watches (The music and characters' reactions really sell it). 

I'm seeing quite a bit of discussion around Gabi and Eren this time around (For anime-only people, at least). I mean, there was already, but this episode seems to have struck a nerve. Although there is responsibility to go around, I honestly don't really blame anyone. 

Gabi is responsible for pulling the trigger and physically killing Sasha, but I also chalk a good amount of it up to her actions being a product of the environment she's grown up in and a natural reaction for someone in her position to have. Again, she's still responsible, but I personally don't harbor any anger towards Gabi. 

Eren...is complicated. Although a war with Marley seems like it was going to happen either way, Eren chose the battlefield and kicked off this specific sequence of events that led to this specific occurrence of Sasha's death (It can never be truly known whether Sasha would or would not have survived in any other given alternative), but I see her death as being an indirect consequence of Eren's actions. I wouldn't absolve Eren of responsibility, but I wouldn't consider him completely or directly responsible. 

In the end, I don't really blame or feel any anger towards anyone. I just feel sad that Sasha died. Rest in potatoes, Sasha, you will be missed. 

Yet, regardless of who's really to blame and who's not, I feel that one of the important takeaways from this is that, justified or not, some of the Scouts blame Eren and, even more importantly, Eren blames himself. 

Regardless, the hardest part of these types of discussions is that we'll never know what could've happened. We can theorize about what would've happened if Eren didn't decide to launch an attack on Liberio on that day at that time, but we can never truly know what the outcome would've been (Especially for a show that's all about things going wrong). It also doesn't help that we're barely out of the Liberio arc, so we - and the characters - can really only speculate about what the consequences of Eren's actions will be until the anime releases more episodes (Even then, it'll probably be a chaotic, morally grey mess). So, until then, I consider myself pretty neutral in this conflict. 

But back to the episode itself, I think it was very strong. It's so impressive how much can be conveyed through lingering on a character's facial expression. I love how much was said this episode without it actually being said. You can feel the conflict and tension in the air that's been developing over the last four years, even if we haven't yet seen the full extent of what happened during that time. I really look forward to what comes next.

Gosh, I love this show so much. That's probably my adrenaline rush from the last episode talking, but I think Season 4 is off to such a strong start. There are certainly elements I miss from the early episodes/seasons of the show (I do miss when titans were these horrifying, larger-than-life, and unknowable threats, but I absolutely love the direction the show is going in). I also love coming on the AoT and SnK subreddits after each episode to see the memes, art, insightful analyses, and theories that people have. As much as I am tempted to wait until the whole season releases to binge it, the experience after each episode is worth it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LordSprinkleman,"The more pragmatic people in the Survey Corps should really be applauding Eren, even though he forced them into this. 

Marley's fleet has been completely destroyed; their military leaders, along with Tybur, are all dead, the Warhammer Titan is now theirs, and they suffered 8 casualties?

Is Hange seriously upset about that? I understand that losing your own would be awful, but how many people were knowingly sent to their deaths during the Survey Corps missions, especially under Erwin's command? These people are no strangers to death. But they revere Erwin, and they revile Eren for causing them to lose 8 people while completely decimating the enemy's forces. The enemy that has killed over half their population. It's not like Eren started a war that hadn't been taking place every time a Titan ate someone from Paradis.

It's a bit ridiculous."
LordSprinkleman,omohami,Right??? This is probably the one mission that ended in success by a pretty huge margin with the least amount of soldiers killed.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kpt_krish,I am honestly glad eren cried. That's the most emotion he showed in this season and I was beginning to get scared of him..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Videogamer2719,Farewell Potato Girl
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,saiful_458,I wonder how gabi and falco will react when they go to paradis Island and realise they're not demons they're all eldians
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ghostwolf1234,I really hope Gabbie's VA doesn't get hate because thats really sad guys. hate the character not the people.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,beyondthegong,"I dont see gabi as an eren parallel at all. They have a lot of similarities but they arent the same

Eren - Wanted to just be free, only hated Reiner and Bertholdt because of their character and what he thought they did. He even went to Marley to learn what they were like and to like them admitting they were the same

Gabi - Hates an entire race of people no matter what. 

Thats the key differences I see. Gabi hates the entire race no matter what. That isnt to say Gabi has been fed propanganda her whole life so it makes sense. But it doesn‚Äôt make them exactly a parallel. I see Gabi as more depraved and inheriting the worst qualities of Erens personality"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,martiwroni,why did they get mad at Eren? I didn't understand it
martiwroni,Efilain,He went rogue. He is valuable as founding titan and knew they would have to come to protect having founding titan so Eren basically forced them to follow him against their will.
martiwroni,Serenist,Eren was the reason this fight happened in Marley so Eren is also responsible for the death of Sasha
Serenist,martiwroni,yea but they got mad at him even before she died
Serenist,silasfuella,This isnt the reason they got mad at him. Levi kicked hiss ass before sasha even was shot
martiwroni,the_eddga,He has the founder and the attack titan so he is the most valuable asset of Paradis. He just went to another country on his own and started a war dragging everyone to battle. Why do you think?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spirelord,"Everyone who is dissecting the technicality of who started the war between Marley & Eren/Eldia, are y'all forgetting the entire past three seasons of the show where Marley had been sending titans to the island for decades, causing intergenerational trauma and fear and death? Paradis has been on the defensive this entire time. Even this attack is practically just a way of neutralizing Marley's ability to send more titans to genocide Paradis via ethnic self-cannibalization."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BrenBrix_Ace,"I'm getting sick of Marley apologists. ""Ah see it shows that morality isn't black and white, you're missing the point of the show"". Like nah dude the point of the show is that people are three-dimensional and that any conflict is going to end up hurting people who have good sides no matter how justified or necessary it is. The point is NOT ""fighting back against genocidal nazis makes you just as bad as them"". 

The two sides in this war are NOT morally equivalent. One side has concentration camps, a deeply racist population, indoctrinated child soldiers on the front lines, and just held a big ""we declare genocidal war"" rally. The other side has been fighting a desperate war of self-defense against slave soldiers (basically what the mindless titans are, they're sent to attack the walls against their will) and has finally had a chance to strike back at a military target. Yes there were civilian casualties, but the attack targeted the military harbor and the assembly of military brass. That's a hell of a lot less civilian death than Hiroshima but people are perfectly comfortable accepting that attack was justified. 

Like guys. We all agree that the war has hurt innocents on both sides and that is bad. Gabi and the other kids are brainwashed and need rehab not punishment. But let's not pretend that this attack of self-defense by the paradis people puts them anywhere near the marleyans morally."
BrenBrix_Ace,Anothercoolkid," The whole point of attack on Titan is the 'us vs them dynamic'. In the end, no one is wrong since everyone has been wronged, thus the endless cycle of war. I don't think Gabi is wrong, I don't think Eren is wrong, but they aren't 'right' either, they're just responding to their condition and conditioning."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AbaramaGolding,I knew it!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nyarlathotepisyummy,"Devastated. Sasha was one of the best characters out there, for sure. 

Also hate how Eren is always blamed for everything. Yes, he killed lots. Yes, several lives had to be sacrificed for him and his/their cause. But someone has to be the bad guy so they do not end up getting eaten alive (literally and figuratively) by the whole fucking world."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skitzofreniq,"Who the hell is Yelena? (I know she's the soldier who tried to trap the Cart Titan in that hole but I mean WHO IS SHE?) I thought it was Annie for a second

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Korx2,"Now I see why Zeke and Levi were holding those stopwatches.
Also, despite being a ‚Äúmiscalculation‚Äù, it‚Äôs a good thing that Pieck and Galliard escaped as Eren had to use the jaw titan to eat the warhammer titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jonnovision1,"Saw a twitter reply about how ‚Äúcharacters like Gabi are why this will never be as good as One Piece‚Äù and I realize twitter is twitter but I see similar sentiments about Gabi being poorly written elsewhere, including here, and it‚Äôs a good jumping off point for what I want to say

I hate when people try to act like a character is objectively bad and/or poorly written because they off a protagonist or a character people love.  Gabi‚Äôs motivations and mindset are imo very well written and explored, even in the pretty short amount of time we‚Äôve had with her so far, especially relative to Sasha.  If you hate Gabi for what she did, fine, but killing a popular character doesn‚Äôt make her badly written"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xord37,It doesn't make sense!  If Zeke was a double agent then why didn't he cooperate with the Paradis island earlier?! And also what was all this talk (when Zeke met Eren the first time) about Grisha brainwashing Eren? and the hate for his father?
xord37,kartickjonty4,In season 3 he said something on the lines of Eren you have been brainwashed by our father.. I will come back for you. I think that could be a reason.
kartickjonty4,worstluckbrian,He said that because the cart titan was there too. He wanted to let Eren know who he was without raising suspicion.

Thanks to him they bought some much needed time and got the resources needed to have a shot at winning this war.

Also, fuck Gabi."
luke-ms,Kronos45,He made the entire world their enemy. This was all part of Willy Tyburs plan remember?
Kronos45,luke-ms,"Seeing the amount of foreign dignataries there and how he had them all hyped before Eren even appeared I don't think they'd hesitate in joining Marley in an invasion. 

If we compare it to real world politics it wouldn't make sense too, backing up the aggressive militaristic nation in a war would probably backfire as soon enough your own country would become a target... I'd be willing to bet some money that we'll actually see other nation(s) helping Paradis at some point. It's also interesting to remember that Marley is pretty much the largest military force in the world at that point in time so getting rid of its military leadership, most of the navy and acquiring some of their titans is surely worth the consequences."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Avenger_3000,"Floch‚Äôs hair was literally like a big, bright, red target and gabi didn‚Äôt aim there instead ????"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DlikeScottie,"Now we know how effective brainwashed child soldiers are in war, even in real life. (At the price of Sasha's life which is depressing) Killing Sasha is like killing the fun and innocence of the show. Could be symbolic that its war and it will be serious from now on."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,abogato33,"Does anyone think that Paradis actually had no choice but to attack? if they did not do so, Marley and the rest of the powers were going to attack them, so they waited until the declaration of war to begin the attack. Do you think Sasha really enjoys killing people? She does it because she has no other option, Gabi instead has her ideals in her empty head that although they have been taught that way, she believes and does not think for herself like Falco or Annie, she limits herself to listening and believing what her family says and people around her, even after killing her, she continues to call them demons (that despite what she did, they left her alive) than worse people eeee and people who excuse themselves by saying that they are a girl ... it seems to me conscious enough of what she does, in fact she was trained to be the successor of a titan, there are no excuses."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lriga,"I'm tired of people saying people shouldn't hate on Gabi. We have witnessed her kill a character people have followed for YEARS. At this exact moment her surroundings, how she was raised doesn't mean shit...she killed Sasha. And for some people they are only seeing her as the person who ended Sasha's life. People are angry, hurt and sad about it, let them rage and express their feelings!"
lriga,EternalCanadian,"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what people are saying. (Or I mean is, maybe they are)

People are saying that you can understand why she did what she did. Her actions make sense and are justified in her eyed.

The entire point of the show is that it‚Äôs a cycle of violence. There is no good side. There are no heroes.

First it was the Elian empire. Then it was Marley, now it‚Äôs Paradise. It‚Äôs going around and around and around and around and as long as people continue to fight, we‚Äôll get another Gabi, or another Eren, etc."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,triggerhappy66,jesus I was expecting something to happen between Gabi and Sasha after that look she gave her BUT NOT NEXT EPISODE AND HER KILLING SASHA... it hurts even more knowing this could've been avoided if Gabi wasn't put into this situation

It's like everyone ignored Jean's comment."
Blitz_Prime,Meidos4,That's the aot fandom in a nutshell. Can't see what the story is trying to tell and instead choose sides and wish for more death and destruction. Always brings me back to that Marleyan officers speech in s3p2 about people needing violence.
Meidos4,rightful_hello,"I think most people here understand the 2 sides but we've all got attached to Paradis' people and that's why you see so many people hating Gabi. I tought she was annoying at first but when she killed Sacha, I officially hater her.

  I understand her thoughts and her anger but she literally killed a character that almost everyone liked. It's not a matter of people picking sides, it's just that we got emotionally attached to one side and it pissed everyone off when I really good character died. If we switched roles, you'd bet people would shit on Eren right now and there would be a movement called #justiceforreiner."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,"I really don't understand how Eren and Gabi are similar.

When Eren was hell-bent on killing Titans he didn't know a thing about them and when he did come to know he mellowed out. Wasn't that the whole point behind him talking with Reiner.

He knows what he's doing is wrong but guess what Marley got what they had coming.

Falco literally told her why Eren attacked, and she's like I didn't see it.I mean wtf?"
-mi_h_ir-,Comfortable-Ad-9231,"Did you literally miss the part where she points out that she wasn't there to see any of Eren's side? If you had barely survived a terrorist bombing after losing loved ones would you really care that the terrorist also lost family because of your government's actions? In the moment, I guarantee you that you wouldn't give a shit."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,instantclassico,I can't find it in myself to be mad at Gabi. If we had been following her pov from the start we would be cheering her on.
instantclassico,kartickjonty4,Really?cheer her on? I would still be mad.. She killed someone who just spared her life a couple of episodes ago and she's still calling them monsters knowing that it was Marley that attacked first. Just look how different Falco's reaction is.
kartickjonty4,Comfortable-Ad-9231,"Nah, I guarantee you if we had been following her POV from the beginning, and she choked or spared anyone, then there would be people saying she was just another spineless mc."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chrisocho8,There is no amount of good writing that is convince me to root for or sympathize Gabi Braun....ever...I want her dead like she‚Äôs Ramsey Bolton and this is GOT and not AOT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kartickjonty4,"Another great episode, seems the yaeger brothers are in on a plan not even the scouts know about. Maybe they are planning for the rumbling!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,redosking,"Guys I can‚Äôt take it anymore. The suspense is killing me, I‚Äôm going to read the manga now üôè"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Optimal_Bit_5600,"Well I don't know whether to be sad that Sasha is gone or relieved that the biggest thing I've been spoiled on this season has finally come to pass. Either way, this was another great episode and this and Assault really remind me of Hero/Midnight Sun. The former is the big exciting climax to the battle while the latter is the quiet but still emotional aftermath. Lots of interesting new developments this episode too, Zeke is in cahoots with Paradise as I expected and Gabi and Falco are hostages. That leaves Marley with Pieck, Galliard, a suicidal Reiner and zero young warrior candidates. How the turn tables.

Going to be completely honest though, and please no one take this the wrong way, I've always thought Sasha felt a bit out of place in the show. She was entertaining and had that cool episode back in Season 2, but other than that I felt like she didn't have the same pathos as the rest of the cast and was just along for the ride. Though maybe that's the point, she was just a random and crazy girl that got caught up in this hectic war and became great friends with those involved. Despite that, it still hurt to see her die and especially everyone's reactions. Even seeing Mikasa and Eren get effected really drove home how devastating a loss this was. R.I.P. Potato Girl."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,waveybirdie,Goddamnit it hurt the first time when I read it. Now watching it and I cried.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainSmeg,"I was spoiled on this but it still makes me angry, the plot armour on Gabi and Falco is incredible so far. 

But holy shit I was slightly spoiled on Zeke working with Eren but I didn‚Äôt think it would be Zeke working with the scouts aswell."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justaverage00,Can anyone explain why Eren spared Reiner and Porco. Seems like he could've easily finished off Reiner and eaten them both
justaverage00,DrHikigaya,I think because he didn't have enough time and strength (since he transformed 3 times in a row) left and the backup was retreating.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kuhlayre,"While I understand that Gabi is just a child and a product of her environment, I wish they got just one more sucker punch in.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,samgo88,wow Manga readers your superior theories always became true empresive
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,masterstealth11,"I am really curious to find out when Zeke turned. It surely must have been after he returned to Marley from Paradis, because he seemed completely genuine as he was mowing the scouts in the battle of shiganshina

I also cant imagine Levi allowing this to happen given what he did to Erwin. Zeke must have a REALLY good reason/explanation

I also wonder who is really making the plan: Zeke or Eren. They were definitely chatting while Eren was in Marley, so who was telling the other what to do?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,adsq93,"Man, I hate people that say spoilers. I also regret putting my cousin on Attack on Titan because he‚Äôs been throwing spoilers non stop. I had to block him. 

That being said, Sasha‚Äôs death woulda hit me so much harder if I didn‚Äôt knew about it before hand."
adsq93,justaverage00,FACTS. I truly hate whoever was sending spoiler DM's this past week. luckily that was the only one I saw but this scene would've hit so much harder if I didn't know
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Book_Of_Cain,"The moment Sasha made eye contact with Gabi I knew it was over for her. But to get killed right before they were able to escape to Paradise, sheesh. It looks like Eren and a couple of other people went rogue, sneaking into Marley which has basically kicked off WW3. I have no idea what his gameplan is, but I'm curious to see how his comrades view him after that. He‚Äôs a loose cannon at this point who seems to be willing to sacrifice anything for this ‚Äúgoal‚Äù no one fully understands. The fact that he has that look that reminds Levi of the underground is concerning. Now you got Gabi and Falco mixed in with the knowledge that Zeke is a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù. Will exposure to the people of Paradise make them leave Marley? I doubt it, especially considering Gabi saw two of her friends die.  Falco seems to be coming to the conclusion that Eren and Berthold did, seeing that there is no good or bad side, but at some point you gotta pick a side. I wonder if Reiner and Colt are going to try getting them back. So many interesting dynamics and interactions are going to happen soon."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,4k_drippydre,Bruh I hate gabi she runs off with a gun like she gonna kill eren but kills my favorite character fuck that bitch

trashassmemes69,AAABattery03,"I don‚Äôt understand why people are trying to make it out to be a dichotomy. 

I hate Gabi for her actions, her refusal to see things Falco‚Äôs way, and her selfishness in acting like it‚Äôs normal to not understand why her friends had to die but refuse to have the same sympathy for others. 

I also think she‚Äôs a victim of brainwashing and she has my sympathy for that, and I truly feel for her not understanding her friends‚Äô deaths when she‚Äôs supposed to be the hero of this story. 

The two are **not** mutually exclusive, that‚Äôs why I love this show."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tomas481516,"Everyone‚Äôs hating on Gabi but all of you would have done the same thing, come on."
Tomas481516,Meidos4,Everyone wishing death upon her for killing Sasha is basically doing the exact same thing as her... She also saw her friends die and wished revenge. Pretty ironic that no one seems to realise that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ze-Bruh,"Eren looked like such a cunt lmao.
Hes abismally different from s3 Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,insertnamee,"I don't understand the Gabi hate, she's been brainwashed all her life to believe that the eldians of paradis island are devils, and here they come destroying her home and killing her loved ones, solidifying her beliefs. Driven by hate and revenge she was determined to kill as many till the very end. 

If we started attack on titan from gabis perspectives, we will be rooting for her to kill these devils that invaded her home and mercilessly killed her friend we grew attached to.

Edit: I mean I get the Gabi hate but i think people need to consider her perspective at least."
insertnamee,CreeperVendetta,"You kind of have a point, but look at Falco. Even before he talked to Eren he still questioned if the Paradis eldians were actually bad. He's had the same amount of brainwashing as Gobi too. Gobi just blindly believes the people that have been nothing but horrible to her, her entire life and to generations before her."
CreeperVendetta,Nearby-County7333,"each person is different, so obviously some people aren‚Äôt gonna have the same perspective"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HereToPartyHardy,That scene before Gabi goes up to the air blimp and is asking why this had to happen to Falco hit so hard. You really see how there‚Äôs no bad guys in this. Falco understands it now and I hope Gabi does too in the future. Fuck I don‚Äôt want to wait another week.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,implordofall,And now I understand all the hate that Gabi gets.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hibiscxs,"I am amazed that Reddit is the place I find the most rational discussion about the episode vs Twitter or Tumblr. The amount of Gabi hate I'm seeing there is crazy. People are seriously wishing death on her as revenge for killing Sasha/cheering for her getting beat up by the Scouts/joking that she should have killed Floch instead.

A lot of people are missing the point in Gabi killing Sasha. It's normal that people are angry about Sasha's death, especially if she was their favorite/ their comfort character. In fact, her death was the best choice for this moment, instead of Floch like I've heard people wishing (I mean, does anyone really *like* Floch?) or any of the other Scouts. Sasha was always the more light-hearted character of the main crew. Her death (and in such a pointless way, too) is a symbol that this final season *is not messing around*. There are no more comfort characters you can count on to smile and joke at the end of all this.

But back to the Gabi hate. Again, it's really understandable why people are mad about Sasha's death, and they need something to direct their anger too. I'm just so confused about how passionately and directly that hate is put to Gabi. 

You shouldn't hate Gabi. Not for killing Sasha, anyway. You can hate her for her personality (she's arrogant, that's for sure), but not for this. Gabi is literally a brainwashed child soldier. We know exactly what Marley feeds the Eldians in terms of Eldian history and the current situation about Paradis Island. We know exactly how the military ropes in their Eldian soldiers with their propoganda. We know that, to Gabi, the Scouts are devils who perpetuate the devilish legacy of the Eldians that Marley continues to use to oppress her people.

Does that justify her actions? Of course not. We know the truth about Marley and Paradis. We know that the people of Paradis aren't devils, and that they have been living in hell for years because of Marley. We know that the girl Gabi just killed wasn't a devil, but a girl who loved meat, who loved her friends, who only wanted to put an end to the hell conditions of Paradis.

But we also know the truth about the Eldians in Marley. We know that they're oppressed and tortured. We know Marley uses them as canon fodder. We know that the Eldians were force fed a nasty and false history that raised them to believe that they deserved the conditions they lived in, and that the only way they could atone for that was to live and kill and die in a war for their oppressors. We know that Eren knows this, and the Scouts probably know it too. We know that Eren and the Scouts just killed countless people who don't know the truth, and who only wanted to be free of their oppression.

There is no right side in the Gabi vs. Sasha situation. There is no right side when the people fighting are the Eldians of Paradis and the Eldians of Marley. They are only two wronged sides in an ugly war waged by Marley.

You should be mad about Sasha's death. It was pointless (not storytelling-wise, but in the context of the war). But the person to blame is not Gabi. The thing to blame is the war, because it's a tragedy. It's a tragedy that Sasha died so fruitlessly, that she had to live the life she did, the one that lead her to join the Scouts and kill monsters and watch her friends die and then kill people. It's a tragedy that the person to do it was Gabi, this kid who thinks she just killed a devil, that she's serving her people, who doesn't know the truth. Maybe she never will. Maybe she'll have lived and killed and died in a war for a country who thought of her as a weapon and never know it. Or maybe she *will* learn the truth, and realize that she killed people for that country, that her friends and family died for that country.

But that's the point of the story-- that there won't be a person like Sasha who comes out the other end smiling and joking. Instead, it'll be a person like Gabi, who might survive and return to Marley, waiting for a reprieve for her people that will never come, who might end up switching sides and fighting the rest of the war against her people who don't know better. Or there won't be anyone coming out on the other side at all."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OldManJulian,Any of y'all NOT get spoiled?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chloe_003,"Yeah.... I like gabi and all but not after this episode. Like I‚Äôve loved Sasha and her and Connie and Jean were my fave trio since the beginning so imma have to hop off the gabi hype train. Shit hurt my soul bruh.

Seeing Connie say Jean and her were like a family to him literally broke my mf heart."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirDogmeat,"From what I gather Levi wasn‚Äôt all for attacking the Marley empire and only did it for Eren, but I think Errn was right in forcing the scouts to attack, Pardis was going to be attacked soon anyway, but at least now they have more time to prepare and have killed/captured a lot of important people and to Titans, all the while only losing 8 scouts, it‚Äôs a massive dub for paradise"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the_heff,"Have I missed something, who‚Äôs Yelena? Has she been in it for a while or is she new?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zack-Coyote,"Having some time to think. God damnit we‚Äôre falling right into the show‚Äôs hands. The whole point of this season is to be grey as to who‚Äôs good or bad. We only have this gut reaction to Gabi because we‚Äôve followed our devils‚Äô story. And that Sasha is a lovable character which makes it hurt more.

But like we‚Äôve seen this season the marlians are people too, I mean shit Gabi isn‚Äôt even marlian. She‚Äôs one of the eldians but we hate her because she has marly ideas. 

We‚Äôre having the same reaction we have when a titan ate a loved character. As if it was the titian, an eldian‚Äôs  fault they were turned into a titian.

Maybe I‚Äôm reading into things too much. But that‚Äôs my take. I hate Gabi for killing one of my favorites, but if that‚Äôs the case I gotta hate eren even more. Obviously he went rogue, like Jean said, eren killed Sasha."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SuperiorSellout,They need to hurry up and throw gabi off of that airship

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hesawavemasterrr,Gabi hate rising higher than GME stock prices.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rissabae,"This episode was just so so to me. I knew Sasha was going to die, but not because someone spoiled it for me. The look Gabi gave her when she shot the guards gave it away. As far as Zeke being behind the attack, wasn‚Äôt surprising at all considering the first couple of episodes implied he was hiding something. 

But back to Gabi! I can‚Äôt stand her and was so happy the scouts stomped her out. I would‚Äôve stomped her again when Sasha died."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YoungExpSD,"Fuck, seeing our new Levi squads eyes made me feel so sad for them. The dreary shadows in their eyes besides Mikasa showed that they‚Äôre already sick and tired of this war against Marley"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SovacoDaCobra,I can at least appreciate that we got a few seconds of Gabi getting the shit kicked out of her. It helped a little.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DivingElbow,"Literally no one is getting out of this show alive. I'd be shocked if two of them did.

As for Zeke, what a fucking twist man, but it kind of makes me irritated this was Zeke's plan (most likely) and not Eren's mastermind plan, but maybe that will all be cleared up soon.

But now what happens to Reiner, Pieck, and Galliard? I guess the whole gist of the plan was to kidnap all of them and use ALL the titans to wage war on the world. But now that 3 of them don't know.....I'm really curious to see how this plays out. This season has been nothing but incredible, every episode is better than the last"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,visual_overflow,Meat and Potatoes. Never forget :'(
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Baodo1511,"Some people still argues that Gabi only killed Sasha out of vengance, just like small Eren did, but they forgot the main point * * * unlike Eren, her personality is quite bitch and unlikeable"
Baodo1511,aethercakes,"The difference between Gabi and Eren, and what makes Eren a far better character, is that Eren didn't know crap about Reiner and co. when they got attacked. He just believed they were fancy titans and his hatred was directed towards monsters. When he learned the truth about the world, he realized that he was the same as Reiner, simply fighting for his country.

Falco, to an extent, has learned that despite his age. Why hasn't Gabi? She's aware they are getting REVENGE for what MARLEY did first, so she's able to question her brainwashing, yet she doesn't at all. I guess her personality is that she's unwilling to think for herself"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,megasean3000,"Marley: **Attacks the innocent people of Paradis on several occasions**

Paradis: **Attacks back**

Gabi: They‚Äôre devils!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justapotato9,"So many questions from this episode. I was so shocked at Sasha‚Äôs death I was literally like Connie unable to say much. The core team have survived for so long I am having a hard time trying to accept her death ;-; 

Zeke‚Äôs betrayal was predicted by so many people here and I am glad he is really the spy, seeing him and levi blame each other is hilarious though. Remembering how bad he was in season 3 it seems like he switched sides during that time skip? 

Did eren go off with his own plan just to target marleyan higher ups? It feels like there could be a better plan. No wonder the scouts are mad at him lmao. Plus eren finally had more expressions in this episode i was getting slightly worried lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joaofig,"Reading the comments right now and I‚Äôm starting to think that I‚Äôm not as emotionally invested as the majority of the fan base. Like yeah I get it it was sad that she died but it‚Äôs not like she was an important character. Her only personality trait was being hungry all the time. I felt the same as when Nejj died in naruto. Sure it was sad but it‚Äôs not like the character had a personality to begin with.

I think the next episodes are going to explain the past four years and understanding zeke‚Äôs plan is going to be amazing!!! I‚Äôm also going to read the manga because 20 minutes in one week is not enough"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mc-tarheel,"Also, Eren's mission cost EIGHT Paradisian lives. That's it. I can see Hange and Levi being angry cos Eren went rogue, but how many Paradisian lives were lost JUST in the attempts to subdue Annie? How many lives taken in a suicide charge against Zeke and Pieck?

All in, I give props to Eren and Zeke for pulling this shit off -- even with Pieck and Falco being freed, which was an unexpected hiccup, but STILL."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frokiedude,Why the hell did the official Crunchyroll twitter account spoil this? Can we sue them?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,downtimeredditor,"Since I don't read the manga yet. 

I'm kinda excited to see how Paradis looks now that the Eldians of Paradise have gained control of the full island. 

Wondering how much advances they have made. Granted it's only been what 4-5 years. 

At least now the Titans are pretty much gone from Paradis since the scout regmine has control of where the Marleyean were creating titans. 

Now that they have attacked Marley and potentially caused the entire world to attack them kinda wondering how they show will finish this year."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HonorsNotDead,"Gabi pursuing the airship created some great tension throughout the entire episode.  You figure she‚Äôs going to shoot someone, meanwhile everyone is just slowly boarding the airship one at a time. Then Jean and the recruit switch places for the rear guard, and I‚Äôm like phew ok it‚Äôs just going to be some rando that catches the bullet. But then the show pulls another switcharoo with Sasha. This show has so many episodes where I‚Äôm on the edge of my seat the whole time, then right when I think the danger has passed, it subverts expectations and throws another heart wrenching twist."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingChonky,"I'm having such a hard time watching this season based solely on the fact that I can't tell if the group from Paradis Island are still the good guys or not. Part of me wants to think ""Well it's understandable how they attacked because they have been tormented by the Marleyean people"" but the assaault on Liberio has just been brutal and there was one part where it seemed like Mikasa thought Eren went too far when he killed civilians. So I've gotta wonder; are they the baddies?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,theend117,"And people wanna feel bad for the Marlyeans. I say kill em all after this episode. I was with the scouts before this episode and this just cemented that feeling for me. Its kill or be killed in war and the Marlyeans started it. I'm not gonna hate on Eren for doing what he did, hes not doing it because he wants to, hes doing all of this because he has to. Hes taken it on himself to be the ""bad guy"" so his people can live. If I were in his shoes I would do the same thing."

I do not understand how Zeke started working with them and how the hell he didn't die from the bomb that Levi put on the beast titan but I guess I just need to wait for answers.

I am not entirely sure about why Sasha's death happened but I do think it's because Levi and Hange told Eren that many soldiers died because of him and he doesn't care but I think most of us got the idea that Eren has no feelings and he is just a straight face, Eren doesn't know these soldiers so that might be the reason he didn't care but because it's Sasha and he knows her, we got to see him angry and that he does care for her.

I might be wrong but who knows."

Zeke‚Äôs alive, that‚Äôs not too surprising. It seems like he‚Äôs working with Eren for some reason(and apparently working with Eren and working with Paradis isn‚Äôt synonymous), so that‚Äôs yet another question to be answered.

Where ever you are right now Sasha, I hope there is as much meat as your heart desires.

The only badass thing he has ever done is when he carried and toss that titan of the window of the castle. And I'm not necessarily sure it was badass since he knew he can recover. 

Like legit the only thing he has ever done is break walls. 

When it comes to combat he has always gotten his ass beat. First time he and eren faced off eren was coming out on top until Reiner used Bertolt to beat him. 

Reiner also got his ass beat by Zeke. Then when he faced off against Eren in Libero Eren One Punched him."

A_Polite_Noise,Saiyan_Deity,"You're making a lot of assumptions. There are a lot of villains and antiheroes I love and defend. People hate Gabbi because she's insufferable, it has nothing to do with her being a new character or the bad guy. 

If it were a matter of hating her for being on the opposite team people would hate Falco, Uldo, Bertholt, Zeke. Annie and Pieck are considered ""best girls"" yet they killed tons of people."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Valman0,"Maybe a dumb question, but i find different answers online:
Will there be a pause after todays episode?
So will AOT S4 air with a second part later this year?

Thanks in advance."
Valman0,AstronomerInDisguise,"There's a preview for the next episode at the end, so no. There will probably be at least 12 episodes in total, like in the previous seasons."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,"Why was Gabi so excited by the prospect of being the next armor anyway, doesn't that mean she has to eat Reiner

I mean I get she wants to do it for her family and all but she still flaunted it, that doesn't seem right."
-mi_h_ir-,silasfuella,Because it is an honor. And also reiner lifespan isnt that long anymore so he is about to die anyway.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,"Zeke's plan worked out it seems. Idk this is way confusing, I don't understand what he wants"
-mi_h_ir-,CapMFLevi,"Zeke said ""you now have the Founding Titan (Eren) and a titan of royal blood (Zeke)."" This right here should tell you 90% of what you need to know about their plan."

But also props to Gabi cause she pretty much no scoped two Scouts back to back.

Also, I saw the Zeke thing coming after they didn't show the Beast or Levi again. Might be the long game plan from their dad.

But damn, Sasha's death fucked me up."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kid__Winchester,"Bro that reiner fight bait killed me. I kept telling myself ""yo next week Eren and Reiner rematch let's fucking go"" and Reiner had cool new armor and shit too. I'm not mad, just a bit disappointed üòû"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OldBirth,"An eerie sigh carried on the still winter air from somewhere in the distance. 

""Mumma, what was that?"" Little Billy asked in something of a whimper, clutching at his mother's yoga pants. 

She tried to mask her own growing concern. ""I'm...I'm not sure, lovey. Let's get to the car before...before you catch a cold."" Her own voice dangerously close to a whimper. Perhaps she fooled Billy, but she couldn't fool herself; it wasn't the cold that made her breath catch and her pace quicken. It was all she could do not to drop the groceries she cradled, scoop up her child and flee full sprint to the car. Even so, the tomatoes perched precariously on top tumbled from the bag and cracked open on the icy pavement like eggs filled with violent red viscera. 

She didn't look back. That sound. That awful sound. When the car door slammed shut she let out a shuddering half-sob of relief. Still, the sound clung to the back of her brain, worming its way around behind her eyes. ""What was that?"" Billy had asked. She didn't know. She didn't want to know. 




Luckily for her, she never would. She didn't watch Anime. She'd never know that awful sound was the anguished cries of millions of weaboos as Best Girl bled out on the floor and Gabi became the most hated anime character of all time."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lightsuki,Attack Titan is the new one punch man!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dongrizzly41,So am I understand right when Hanger was talking to Erin she said he had been captured before and they had to save him? Was this referring to S3 or had something else possibly happened in the timeskip?
dongrizzly41,JooK8,"He was captured by Annie.  Levi squad died and so did many others. 

He was captured by Reiner/Bertoldt and like half the scouts died + Erwin lost his arm. 

He was captured by Kenny's squad and tons of scouts died facing them. 

I do not think he was captured in between then and now but for all we know he could have been.  The fact still remains, that every time he is captured, people die for his sake.  And in this case, he got himself into a bad situation by his own doing, where they were forced to go save him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JooK8,"I think that in the future there will be a fight between Paradis and the world after failed negotiations (because of what Eren made happen in Liberio).  At this point Paradis will try to win with just the Titan powers but Eren will opt to use the wall titans to decimate the other side.  Zeke and Eren will then have to fight each other, but at every moment that Zeke makes physical contact with Eren, Eren barks an order at the wall titans.  Basically they'll have to be forced to kill Eren (probably Armin or even Mikasa) in order to save the world.  Or, maybe a single order from Eren to the wall titans will be enough and then Eren will kill Zeke so that what he's started cannot be undone unless Historia is turned into a titan and eats Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Keleus,This season is so painful. I feel like the episodes are too short for what they need to accomplish. Like this episode felt like literally nothing happened besides Sasha being shot. Like they were already leaving on the airship last episode and this whole episode they were still leaving and they still didn't finish leaving by the end of it so practically nothing changed. Dont get me wrong I love this show but feel like things are moving extremely slow and they are running out of time before the series finale. Feel like the ending is going to be too rushed in 1 or 2 episodes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5yk0515,"Bah, Gabi got off way too easy. Damn Jean and his humanity. Feel a bit bad for Falco, but Gabi for the streets."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YepYouRedditRight2,"I think this is Isayama‚Äôs fucked up way of saying that during war, the person you kill could‚Äôve been someone else‚Äôs best friend or even family. Which is true for a lot of things.

We did sort of get this in Season 3 when we found out about the titans being transformed humans, but it never really impacted us that much, since we got to know most of those people via flashback. This time, it‚Äôs Sasha, someone we‚Äôve enjoyed and even related to over the past three seasons. To Gabi, it‚Äôs just another bad guy who hurt her friends and family, but to Jean, Connie, Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else, it was a family member.

Gabi‚Äôs whole thing is basically like going through Eren‚Äôs arc all over again. She wants revenge and she gets it, but unlike Eren, there isn‚Äôt anyone hold her back (anyone that she would listen to anyways)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Demonitize,Do we know where the female titan is at this point? I assume she's still in the crystal.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LennethTheCat,I have just one question: is that guy Lobov the same Lobov that hired Levi and his comrades to kill Erwin back when they lived in the underground city? Or am I mixing names?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DapperDaveW,Poor Lobov
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meanteenbirder,My new theory is that Sasha‚Äôs death was necessary because she would‚Äôve been so hungry she would try to eat Eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,User092792,I just realised that Eren has probably inherited the memories of the last Attack Titan shifters by now which includes Grisha. I guess this is a reason why the scouts and Zeke are teaming up?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,squazyleader,I gotta be honest. I don‚Äôt really feel hatred towards Gabi. I honestly like her as a character and sort of understand her. She has been indoctrinated to be a fanatical hater of Paradisian Eldians. I really fucking hate that Sasha died and I‚Äôm pissed about that but  it just shows nobody is safe from war and each party believes that what they are doing is what is right.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OGFN_Jack,"Because people still can't seem to understand why the Eren and Gabi comparison makes 0 sense I will try to go through every point as clear as possible.

Eren and Gabi's hometowns were both attacked by foreign enemies that is true. However, lets look at the circumstances between the two

**Paradis/Eren**

* Paradis is a place surrounded by gigantic walls, as massive titans who eat them roam their island. These walls effectively trap the majority of the population in a place where they can never leave as they fear the titans who for some unknown reason inhabit their island eat any human they see.
* One random day, two very powerful titans attack Eren's hometown for an unknown reason. Slaughtering half the population, including Eren's mom, thus fueling Eren's hatred for Titans as they killed his people, his mom, and destroyed the town he lived for a reason he does not know.
* He joins the scouts and ends up learning he has the power of the attack titan. He uses this power to liberate his people from the titan threat, watching many of his comrades fall along the way and learns that a place called Marley has been sending titans to their island for years, and sent Reiner and co. there to recover something called The Founding Titan. Learning that he has more enemies responsible for so much death and destruction, he sets out towards Marley to get his revenge

**Marley/Gabi**

* Marley is a country that is run by a government that forces Eldians to live in an interment zone and fight in wars Marley starts.
* Gabi is a part of a select few group of talented kids are selected to be apart of their program where they are going to be injected with something that turns them into killing machines with the potential to wipe out an entire city if they wanted to. 
* These powers that they will receive will allow them to travel to Paradis and exterminate the entire island. The people of Paradis have never left their island to attack Marley, yet apparently they are ""devils"" and a ""threat to world peace"". Gabi is determined to achieve the role of the armored titan, and as someone who has already murdered hundreds, is overjoyed at the opportunity to go to Paradis and wipe them all out. 
* As her country declares war publicly on Paradis, Gabi is ecstatic to attack these people, even though she has never once seen first hand that they are of any threat to her and has only been told. As this announcement happens, Eren and co. attack destroying Gabi's hometown and killing multiple of her friends.
* As she prepares to attack them, Falco, someone who has gone through the exact same experience as her, tells her that he learned that the reason they are doing this is because they were attacked years ago by none other than Reiner and co. 
* Even though this is a wildly dumb claim to make up, and knowing that Falco is just as upset as her Gabi decides to use the logic that if she didn't see it, then it didn't happen and ignores this. Even after hearing this, Gabi's thirst for blood doesn't settle, and she sneaks on board the ship, killing Sasha.

If you read all of this, and think that there are any real similarities outside of the fact that their homes were attacked, then I'm really not sure what else to tell you."
OGFN_Jack,Badalight,"You're missing the point. Eren's hatred was towards titans (literal monsters). Gabi's hatred is towards Eldians who she believes (and has been brainwashed to believe) are literal monsters. From her perspective, they are. I don't think you understand how powerful indoctrination can be. Not to mention, they aren't even necessarily wrong. Eldia DID try to wipe Marley out 100 years ago."
OGFN_Jack,ivankasta,"I mean Gabi genuinely believes that the Paradis Eldians are closer to monsters than they are to humans. She's been indoctrinated into that belief since birth. Then without warning, these ""monsters"" invade her hometown and kill her friends. 

I'm not saying that it's a perfect parallel because it's not, as you pointed out. But I still think there are pretty significant intentional parallels between the two."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mc-tarheel,"Fuck Gabi.

She talks about how hard she's worked to make Eldians look good, but she's broken MULTIPLE rules of war, JUST in the time we've known her.

She walks in her night clothes towards the enemy with grenades attached to her ankle, knowing folks would hesitate cos she's a child. NOPE.

She COUNTS on folks hesitating. She plays up tf out of her innocence, even going so far as to take her uniform off. Fuck her."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,carame1sundae,This episode was amazing! MAPPA did the scenes justice! I look forward to the next episodes!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meanteenbirder,Can we just stop for a moment and recognize Falco is mostly innocent? He just wanted to protect Gabi and keep her out of trouble without fighting the enemy. The scouts should kill Gabi and indoctrinate Falco tbh.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThroughTheIris56,"I really dislike Gabi as a character, but mainly because she's annoying and used the fact she's a child to sucker punch people. I can't really blame her for killing Sasha though, the scouts just wiped out half of her home town so it's going to be natural she'd want revenge. She didn't even really aim for Sasha, she basically just shot into the crowd.

That said, it's a bummer that Sasha is gone."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,heather_shieldss,"i‚Äôm glad levi kicked eren, i don‚Äôt hate erens character but he‚Äôs starting to act like a moody teenager who knows everyone HAS to blindly follow him no matter what he does and it annoys me a little"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spirelord,"Jean's outburst towards Eren was a just a tad irksome...yes, 7 Waldians were killed including one of Jean's best friends, and that is sentimental and all, but Marley lost two titans, their entire main port was incinerated, and their military's top generals except Magath were obliterated. This is nothing but a rousing success of a mission with *insanely* minimal losses, a complete tactical victory, and one that would not have occurred under alternate circumstances."
Spirelord,terrancelovesme,exactly. people are missing that eren could see the future and probably saw the tyburs declaring war and invading paradis. If he didn‚Äôt act now they could‚Äôve been fucked especially with marleys military prowess + allied powers.
Spirelord,JPastori,"Except now there might be more enemies than just Marley. It sounded like from what Hange said I believe that the rest of the world wasn‚Äôt about to just jump on board with Marley to attack. But after Eren attacked a populated city, which killed many civilians, more countries may join in on that attack. Otherwise I‚Äôd agree and I think some of the smarter characters would‚Äôve seen that but it seems like Paradise is being put on everyone‚Äôs shit list because of the attack"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nigelfitz,"Floch got Sasha killed.

If the motherfucker didn't celebrate prematurely and hyped everyone up, the scouts would've been focused and alert and bitchass Gabi would've gotten in the airship.

Fuck Floch and Gabi."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedSoupSilver,"Damn man, I keep thinking that if this was season 1 of the show, I would probably be rooting for the warriors and warrior candidates"
RedSoupSilver,JooK8,"Yeah if you have no knowledge of the scouts or anything, then it would look like Eren is a random usurper who stole the founding titan and is planning to use it to attack the world.

He then attacks along with these people flying around on the rooftops for seemingly no reason and kills a fuckload of people while his buddy Armin shows up out of nowhere and kills a whole bunch more.

The only difference though, is you see the major details here that happened in the shadows during S1.  You see that Eren deliberately made sure that Falco was there for his conversation with Reiner, and you see Falco understands what happened, and why it happened.  They mention that history will keep repeating itself and they are showing all the parallels between Shiganshina and Liberio, but the main difference is Falco.  I'm sure he will be very important moving forward."
RedSoupSilver,BryantBuckets,Maybe but they actually described the atrocities Marley committed beforehand. It wasn‚Äôt like season 1/2 where we only saw one side.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rocketbird,That moment when Conny hugged Sasha and Jean and Sasha had the sweetest look on her face.. like she loved conny or had some kind of sadness in her heart for what had happened.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kono_kermit_da,"I'm really confused about the hatred against Gabi? 

She seems like a fine enough character to me. She's an antagonist (in the sense that she's part of the forces that oppose our protagonists) but as a character she seems pretty well rounded and interesting. Is it because she's done horrible things? I mean... yeah, that's pretty much the point of the show, everyone has done horrible things no matter what their reasons for it were (just of the top of my head you have: Reiner , Berthold, Annie, Erwin, Armin, Eren, Zeke...) but for some reason it seems the Gabi gets a whole lot of hate as a character even though it seems like she's filling up her role pretty well? I dunno man."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ChadTheMagnificent,Is it alright to hate Gabi? Because *HOLY FUCK* do I hate gabi.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CausticCarnivore,"Assassins Bullet was so dumb. I‚Äôm not a competition shooter by any means. But how the fuck does a child, line up and nail a dude who‚Äôs flying through the AIR, in the HEAD, and conveniently he drops down to where she has easy access to his gear to climb up and NO ONE is watching the fucking door. They see the gun, no one fucking moves and just stands there like idiots and Sasha gets shot once and just decides to die. I get getting shot isn‚Äôt fun, but a lung shot doesn‚Äôt immediately spell death. You know how heavy a bolt action rifle is? If it‚Äôs close to a Karabiner 98k it‚Äôs about 9 pounds. And Gabi is 12 years old. How the fuck is a 12 year old quickscoping people with a long ass rifle. You killed one of my favorite characters AoT, so I‚Äôm picking the flaws apart as revenge. Fuck this episode"
CausticCarnivore,Meanteenbirder,"Not just any child. They‚Äôre trained substantially, including how to use guns. Everyone is also probably shocked."
Meanteenbirder,CausticCarnivore,"Unfortunately we have a lot of countries to look to in terms of child soldiers, their only advantage is people don‚Äôt take them as immediate threats because they aren‚Äôt grown, people have been shooting all their lives and still don‚Äôt hit the level of skill as this 12 year old. I‚Äôm not trying to dispel your argument, a point can be made in that direction, however I did take that into consideration while watching this, sure, some kids may have a natural talent for things at a young age. But that‚Äôs few and far between, and it‚Äôs unrealistic to see that level of performance when a carbine like the one she shot has enough weight and recoil to knock her on her ass even if she‚Äôs been trained."
CausticCarnivore,joaofig,"I think it was luck, not even Gabi was expecting to make that shot"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cojovoncoolio,Falco literally explained why they did what they did and Gabi still went and had to kill Best Girl. Keep Falco alive because he's innocent still and throw Gabi off the fucking airship and have Armin transform next to her
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Callum196227014,"Eren is 100% right in attacking. Did everyone just forget how Marley imprisoned everyone within the walls of the island? So 8 people died during the attack? But how many were killed by Reiner, Annie and that lanky guy? Levi‚Äôs entire squad got turned to mush in 30 seconds. Did everyone forget that?"
Callum196227014,Roseking,"No one is pissed at Eren for wanting to hurt the military and people like Reiner.

They are pissed because they have learned their are entire civilizations beyond what they knew who have just as many innocent people that Eren is willing to kill.

That is the entire point of the story. It's a cycle of revenge and hatrad that feeds on itself. Eren literally created people like him from season one. They watched their loved ones die for apparently no reason. And now those people will want revenge. Once they get theor revenge, it will create more victoms that will the  want their own revenge. So on and so on."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,throwaway12575,"Sasha killed two soldiers in front of a child when they weren't even an active threat. 

Yes it's war and everyone chose their side, but Gabi was more than justified to seek revenge like that. Why the hate?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BreezySaturn97,Gabi you are the worst
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Serniebanders69,"Am i the only one that didn't really mind sasha dying? she had one episode of characterization where she saved that little girl, but otherwise she was relegated mainly to just the background. Idk maybe it is just me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,insanecurity,"So sad to see how many people got spoiled about Sashas death! I too have read the Manga and keeping it in is honestly not hard, there‚Äôs Manga discussion threads for that, why would you take away someone‚Äôs experience like that :("
insanecurity,TottenhamAreShit21,It‚Äôs a power thing for some people. They like the fact that they know more than someone else
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Changlini,"I‚Äôm more pissed off at the partying while still in the combat zone trope than Sasha getting killed.

I mean: The last time I saw this thing playing out was as a kid trying to finish Advance Wars: Days of ruin. And I was pissed off back then from the main characters partying hard while in the vicinity of an active combatant with nuke capabilities. Wtf anime, please be better than this lol 

I never would have expect Sasha to die because of an idiot that decided to party while in an active combat zone that is within what is basically an alien land. Just... okay."
Changlini,justaverage00,"since this is the final season, I guess we're gonna have to get used to a lot of characters getting killed off. this show is so cruel"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,byakkkun,Falco is the eren for this season. I kinda like that guy!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AcousticAtlas,I‚Äôm very happy Eren is being forced to take accountability for his actions. Lots of good people are dead because of him.
AcousticAtlas,dongrizzly41,Honestly I don't think its any scenario where good people don't die in this case. War is messy unfortunately.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SkatanSerDig,"I liked Sasha but honestly, she was the most one-dimensional character ever, which I presume is also why she was killed off. I remember her supposed to be killed off in S2 but a friend of Isayama got so sad he changed it.

I guess ""me like meat & food"" is still personality enough to make fans cry for the loss tho."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DonaldGrabbedMyKitty,"I hate all these comments about why Gabi isn't a C\*\*\* and how she's justified or brainwashed.  I have a lot of pain right now, so much pain, and I just want to hate this one insufferable child and wish for her painful and horrific demise"
DonaldGrabbedMyKitty,zachariusTM,"There is clearly a parallel being drawn between her And Eren in addition to the Reiner/Eren parallel.

The fact so many people hate Gabi is a testiment to how good the show is."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jjc00ll,Such a dumb set up. Yes they‚Äôre going to start celebrating before they even clear enemy territory so plot armour can kill off a fan favourite. Ah well at least the paradisians actually did the name taking this time.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sahil2921,no mah best girl that was so sad fuck gabi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loves_gold,The comparisons between Gabi and Eren are bogus she has literally killed people in wars as a child soldier and one 9/11 happens and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwe need to avenge them for this war they started‚Äù what a moron bro they should throw her out the ship
loves_gold,Shawnessy,"Kid going through a traumatic event. Child soldier, brain washed to believe all that they do. It makes sense, given how much of a hot head she's been shown to be. 

Her skills with a rifle, at least that first shot, were definitely a bit over the top."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,War_NeverChanges,"The gabi hate is expected but not surprising. People here are angry but don't forget this is the female version of Eren. Not to mention, it's Eren's fault this happened.

At this point, it's not fuck this side for me. It's fuck everyone. 

You can go ahead and downvote, let the emotions get the best of you."
War_NeverChanges,Changlini,I'm with you. If this season taught my anything: It's that the only people left worth rooting for are the ones that want the dying and fighting to end.
Changlini,justaverage00,team Jean
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Timbishop123,"Really wild that people don't understand the entire point of S4 is to show that there are no good people in war. Yea Sasha died, but she killed more than a few people, and she fought on the side that slaughtered innocents ( 2 of which were Gabbi's friends). Gabbi killing Sasha was justified. Yes Marley caused the walls to fall, but the Elidians used to enslave the world, so it is a chicken and egg scenario on who is to blame."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aj12wedf,"Guys stop trashing on Gabi, admitted she killed Sasha but it's a war and people die...shes basically the female version of Eren Yeager and shes a slave to the propaganda which is being fed to her by The Marleyans...Give her a break..but I'm still disappointed in her for killing Sasha."
aj12wedf,Gummy_Tris,i have no idea why you're getting downvoted
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AsrielGoddard,"Guys, can you really be mad at Gabi? Just like the eldians in S1-3 she saw her friends die right next to her. All her live she has been fed lies about the paradisians and her self.   
Even if I wanted to I couldn't hate her. Rather I feel sad and pity her.  


But man Sashas death really got to me. (despite being spoiled by some c\*nt through DMs)"
AsrielGoddard,OGFN_Jack,"I mean she was already a soldier who had murdered hundreds and was determined to achieve the power of the armored titan to genocide an entire island. I do feel kinda bad because she was brainwashed, but the level of sympathy is a bit lower than Erens in the first episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WetDonkey6969,"Why exactly are the scouts mad at Eren? If there was plan that he broke, they never really made it clear unless I missed something."
WetDonkey6969,QTFsniper,There was no plan. He went off on his own and essentially forced them to come since they can't risk losing the attack Titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,silverstyrofoam,"There are so many questions to be answered, and another metric fuckton just got piled on. We only have 16 episodes left to not only explain everything that's happened, but to end and resolve the entire story of Attack on Titan. Can they pull that off in 16 episodes?"
silverstyrofoam,LlamaLegacy,"Correction, there are only 8 episodes left this season. At the place they‚Äôre currently going (~2 chapters/ep), there will still be around 20 chapters left to adapt, so expect a Season 4 Part 2"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MystickalNomad,Sasha Braus.... Gabi Braun... their surnames are way too similar to be coincidental.  And they have the same hair color.  I‚Äôm sitting here a little torn up over potato.  But I get the feeling their related in a tragic sorta way.  Like maybe Sasha was Gabi‚Äôs aunt or cousin or something and never knew it.  Just a thought.
MystickalNomad,AMK2201,"Well no. Reiner is Gabi's maternal cousin. If Sasha were her aunt, she'd have to be Gabi's mother's and Reiner's mother's sister, which would never be the case as the mothers are middle aged.

Also how would it make sense for the Braun family, which has existed in marley and outside of Paradis for basically a hundred years, to be related to Sasha's family which would've originated from the Eldians who were moved to Paradis?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,firewingdale,"I thought it was weird for long ranged fighter like zeke gorilla to come so close to battlefield with many blind spots and chances for him to get ambushed by scouts now I see why it was like this

Still I hate him so much that sociopath"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ahmed_Umar,Gabi did nothing Wrong.
Ahmed_Umar,kartickjonty4,Yup only killed the woman who showed mercy on her by not shooting her in the earlier episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,QuietIllustrious,Gabi a goat she really wasnt finna let sasha get away with that at first I thought gabi was gon die but she did something
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kono_kermit_da,"Fuuuuuck this episode was so good. 

People badmouthing Mappa really need a reality check. I never cared much for Sasha until this season, she had her moments before but all of them kinda felt hollow to me. But this season... damn, her synergy (even though it was only a couple of scenes) with Connie and Jean, her badassery as a sniper and her less histrionic characterization really made me like her character a lot more than the previous 3 seasons. Making her death super impactful, especially for the way the characters around her react. Armin and especially Mikasa (whom I really didn't like in earlier seasons) reacting to her death without us hearing their voices makes the whole moment so much more poignant and memorable. It also reminds you that these characters have really been through a hell of a lot together and the 4 years that have passed were spent in each other's company. The fact that Sasha dies without giving us a anime speech to her friends makes the whole scene feel so much more brutal and real.

I'm also glad we didn't get another Attack vs. Armor titan fight, I dunno why but those kinda bore me and at this point seeing a defeated Reiner going against Eren would be a bit meh.

I'm also very interested in the tall lady that was introduced and can't wait to see what and who are the 'Zeke followers'"
kono_kermit_da,worstluckbrian,Reiner easily lost but he was able to save the Jaw titan.
worstluckbrian,kono_kermit_da,"Totally forgot about that, that was a very neat move! can't wait to see how porco reacts to knowing this."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Edgy0515,PLEASE JUST TOSS GABI OFF THE SHIP
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Galaxypanda32,Honestly I felt like sasha death could of been done better. We had an ~5 year time jump and she only had a few lines since then. She probably changed a lot but we didn't get to she that. Overall I think the show should of focused a bit more on her.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WirelessShit,"Just a fuckin filler that they made to kill someone, like, nothing happened on this ep.

This ep in a nutshell:

Reiner ü§õEren
Gabi: I'm angry
üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
ü•î: Lol I'm dead"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PopipoNumber1,"So Gabbi is basically Eren of Marley and Falco is like Armin I guess? 

Dont understand the hate as I really like their character tho...

If you need someone to blame for Sasha death, imo it's Eren or Zeke"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kellythejellyman,"Up until Today, Gabi was in contention for 2nd Best Girl

i‚Äôll give ya 2 guesses for who was 1st


i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm gonna jump on the Gabi hate train because she had VERY compelling reasons to my mind.  Plus if i was able to tolerate S1 Eren, i can take her (wasn‚Äôt a big fan of angery rage princess peach back then, Gabi atleast has the excuse of purposeful indoctrination. )


Also Zeke with that double cross, Falco has had one hell of a night, my boi is gonna have major trust issues 

looks like next episode will be flashbacks to the last 4 years in Paradis, so we may still get more Potato Girl just to twist in that knife"
Kellythejellyman,JPastori,"Honestly I‚Äôm kinda seeing S1 eren in Gabi but with reversed roles. They both have this intense inner strength to wipe out their enemies no matter the cost, and they both have the almost suicidal will to act on it."
JPastori,Kellythejellyman,"Eren prolly would have died like 4 times by now atleast if he wasn‚Äôt a Shifter 

~~~Wait why didn‚Äôt the Santa Titan take Eren‚Äôs powers when he ate him in season one? was it that he technically hadn‚Äôt died yet?~~"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OrnellBryant,"Definitely dislike Gabi but, I can‚Äôt blame her for her actions. Jean was right, had they thrown the kids out of the airship, they‚Äôd have been no better than the bastard Marleyans who subjected Eren‚Äôs generation of paradisians to countless torturous titan deaths.

Gabi‚Äôs a piece of shit but she‚Äôs 12. She can still change. If Falco‚Äôs capable of being more pragmatic and looking at the bigger picture, Gabi is perfectly capable of following suit. 

I am extremely vexed by the fact that she killed Sasha but, I hope my mind changes and I grow to like the character. Even Eren‚Äôs motives have been morally reprehensible this season."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JPastori,"Everyone‚Äôs hating on Gabi but she‚Äôs kinda like season 1 eren if you think about it, their roles are just reversed. Eren had such a blind rage and desire to kill all Titans that if he hadn‚Äôt had his power he would have died several times over. Gabi has the same rage and desire but for enemies of Marley, if it wasn‚Äôt for the jaw Titan she would‚Äôve been gunned down in episode one if I‚Äôm correct, and she would‚Äôve died in the last few episodes if she wasn‚Äôt shot at because she‚Äôs a child. Quite honestly I kinda wished she was introduced earlier with a Titans power, it would‚Äôve been interesting to see her go head to head with eren and the survey core wielding that type of power."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nobus205,Fuck eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,danmathe123,OK but why does Zeke betray marley?  Please answer without spoilers
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Thevoidawaits_u,"I have a few questions:

1)How long are they in the military? Shouldn't their service have ended by now? Did they volunteer to extend their service time or did military extended it? If so why are they in the same rank as 4 years ago(except for Jean)?

2) Why did the monarch gave a thumbs up for this operation? She would have known that attacking first will cause a WW(and most likely massive ethnic forced dislocations and slaughters if Marely and the nations win).

 If she knew the details of Eren's plan and cooperated that makes her personally culpable of his war crime (unprovoked attack on civilian population)

3) How do the Eldeian warriors and the rest of them excuse their attempted genocide? Reiner and his group were kids sure, and Zeke is a massive psychopath(though now he seems good(?)) but Pieck is a companioned intelligent adult how the hell does she justify her help to the attempted massacre the inhabitants of Peredais(in season 3)?"
Thevoidawaits_u,Efilain,"1) in s1 it took them 5 years to complete the training, and they were all 15 years old, timeskip took 4 years so they are around 19y/o now. There is too little info now, perhaps it will be explained later

2) it was specifically said in this episode (once Eren get onto the ship, convo with Levi and Hange) that Eren went effectively rogue, knowing that they would follow him even if he defied them (since he has the founding titan, i don‚Äôt think paradis would give up founder to marley without a fight) and therefore i dont think anyone gave ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù for this operation.

3) it‚Äôs not like Eldians got many rights. Only way that Eldians can get any ‚Äúdecent‚Äù living is for the kids to become warriors and elevate their family to be ‚Äúhonorary marleyans‚Äù. Marleyan eldians also get hammered into them that the people on the islands are monsters threatening the world peace. So the inhabitants of the islands aren‚Äôt innocents being massacred, to them.

All of this was already explored in S4, perhaps a rewatch could help. But maybe it‚Äôll get clearer as the season moves on"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JonnieTaiPei,"It's crazy how people hate Gabi, her character it's just like Eren in first season. Makes me think about the morale of humanity and our capacity of judge with objectivity (if that exists) 

Hope y'all are enjoying this masterpiece, after Evangelion the best show I saw. (apart from the all around-nostalgic machine Dragon Ball and Z)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Flabnoodles,Is Eren the villain now? If he and Reiner are the same...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ylsid,"Gabi is such a Mary Sue, I hate her. This season would have been vastly improved if she was written out"
Ylsid,hapiscan,"She's just skilled. A Marie Sue wouldn't have gotten owned by the crew after she shot Sasha. At this point, I'm getting to believe that most fellas hate her because she's a woman."
hapiscan,JooK8,">I'm getting to believe that most fellas hate her because she's a woman.

That's a pretty leftist assumption with no reasoning. Why are you finding a way to make it sexist?

People hate her because she is cocky and full of herself.  She talks down to the other warrior candidates and has an unreasonable hate for the Paradisians who we're all invested into.  Falco is doing everything for her and she's constantly an asshole to him.Even with Falco explaining to her why everything happened in Liberio she refuses to acknowledge it.  On top of that she has now killed Sasha which the manga readers knew she was going to do, and who knows what else she does next.  To assume people don't like her because they're sexists is so stupid, when everyone here is heartbroken over Sasha's death (another female) and many of the other female cast are some of the most beloved in the series like Mikasa, Hange, Annie etc.  Hell, I'm pretty sure there's a group of Pieck simps out there now and she's another female on the Marley side."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ok-Complex-1569,"Bruh I hate Gabi like bruh she‚Äôs so annoying like why is she even doing in the show, like to my eyes, she‚Äôs just another kelfia. I hope she gets beat up by Levi because she‚Äôs just sooo annoying."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GodlyGreNinja,Why dafuq was Eren laughing tho
GodlyGreNinja,hushzone,Because it was funny?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brewu4,Am I the only one relieved it was Sasha? It was obvious someone from the og cadets was going down I was worried it was conny.. for whatever reason I have more of an attachment to him... maybe slightly more time was spent on his character development. But I was actually a little relieved it wasn‚Äôt him. Bummer but Sasha just didn‚Äôt tug at my heart strings ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,downtimeredditor,"Gabi has a lot of Eren in him. 

Going into a line of fire and dangerous territory without a thought to her own life. 

The actions of Grisha is what lead to them being there..

If he followed the way of life being persecuted as an eladian he would have likely been a doctor with a family and kids. Dina Fritz would have never met him so no Zeke. He would have never inherited the Attack Titan and gone inside the walls and met Carla so Eren. No eren means Mikasa would have likely gone into Child sex trafficking ring and may have ended up in the same place as Levi's mom. Kinda weird I think the Ackerman's faced a similar fate inside the walls as the eladian outside the wall..

And while it's possible armin may have survived the titan outbreak he likely would have a faced a very normal refugee lifestyle I side the walls as a scholar or something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uglyassvirgin,that episode was mids
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,orb_outrider,I was spoiled days ago by fucking Twitter. It described why 'sasha' was trending. What an asshole of a website lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,namebois,everyone needs to go to r/GabiCult and spam fuck gabi posts
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AbaramaGolding,"Hear me out guys

So Zeke has been following Grisha's plans all this time? He was traumatized when he was a kid because Grisha told him to betray his parents. Now that he knows about Historia  he had to find a way to take control of the warhammer titan? so will they all sacrifice themselves so Hisoria eat all of them or what? I also feel like Eren will still go on another rampage"
AbaramaGolding,LikesCherry,According to Grisha's journal he didn't expect Zeke to betray him
AbaramaGolding,MyTVAlt,"I mean we dont know for sure yet I guess, but it seems more likely based on what we do know that Zeke switched sides more recently and was not following Grisha's plan, although I can't rule out that possibility entirely."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,derpatron13,Fuck gabi.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,putangas,Gabi Is a very annoying character . Hope she doesn't get much screentime cause it's ruining the show for me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ArtyMostFoul,"I think I now understand why everyone hates Gabi so much? 

But legit, she is what Erin would have been had he been raised there, she is basically female Erin, there was such a similarity between his moment on the boat and hers in the alley before running off with the gun. 

Horror breeds more horror. You become what you despise when you fight like for like.

For the first time today I had a moment when I said, Fritz was right. I didn't think those words would ever cross my lips."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Leomar91,I dislike Gabi but I understand where she‚Äôs coming from.... it‚Äôs the last of us 2 all over again.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xose94,I hate Eren so much right now...
xose94,dongrizzly41,Wtf why? I feel like he's completely justified.
dongrizzly41,xose94,"Because he just caused the entire world to declare war on Paradis. Sure Willy could talk and talk how much he wanted about how dangerous they were but that doesn't mean that the rest of countries will just follow him blindly. Let's remember that the season starts with Marley at war, a war that was 4 year long and very costly, Marley is hated by their neighbors. Let's remember that Reiner almost died by the anti-titan weaponry.

The commanders in Marley even recognized that they put too much weight in the titans meanwhile other countries instead developed anti-titan weaponry. Countries that hate Marley and would probably not go to war supporting them some could even join Paradise or just be neutral waiting to see who wins.

But now Eren just killed diplomats and nobility of those same countries, he proved Willy right describing Eren as a psychopath that just wants to kill everyone and pretty much forces every single country to ally Marley."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,scandalismo87,I hate Gabi and Falco. They fucking suck.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Demonitize,All my homies hate Gabi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kaliskonig,"People hate Gabi when this is Erens fault. This is all on Eren. Eren had no business forcing his friends into this situation without them agreeing to it. He took advantage of the fact that they are his ride or dies and got them killed.

At this rate none of the main cast will actually be able to proudly live out their eventual freedom all thanks to Eren forcing their hand. I hope Jean is the one to put Eren in his place if Mikasa and Armin don't grow a backbone."
kaliskonig,JPastori,I think armin might speak up but mikasa is ride or die for eren no matter what at this point.
kaliskonig,realkin1112,"well you need to keep in mind that the whole world was going to attack paradise and destroy it as willy typur said, staying in paradise is technically just more prolonged death"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chipthehippie,"Why did Sasha have the nerve to ask ""when are we eating"" after she got shot?

You just ate lead. Save some food for the rest of the soldiers."
chipthehippie,namebois,thats dark as shit
namebois,chipthehippie,"You're watching a show about genocide, human eating giants, and children murdering adults. But *I'm* dark for making a joke about what happened.

Ok"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ChameleonTwist2,Unpopular opinion but I really don't like Levi. I just have an intense disdain for people who think they can go around punching others. Even more so when it's an abuse of rank.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mega512,Gabi is one of the worst characters introduced this season.  She's so absurdly cliche and just sucks.  This child is superhuman and can apparently do things no adult can do.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DonaldPump117,"Really wish they'd get the plot moving. There just feels like a lot still needs to happen to wrap up this great show, and I'm afraid the ending is going to be super rushed with a 3 minute exposition montage to end the last episode. Don't let AoT be GoT"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raging-Burrito,So Zeke said that the casualties were worth it because now that Eren had the founding titan now with royal blood. The problem I see is that grisha ate the founding titan who was of royal blood already. Shouldnt the founding titan power have worked for grisha also by Zeke's logic?
Raging-Burrito,Kaioken64,"Grisha wasn't of Royal blood, zekes Royal blood comes from his mother."
Kaioken64,Raging-Burrito,I get that but its not like Zeke can using the founding titan with eren having it. When he mentioned this I thought he was trying to say they could use the founding titan because eren ate the war hammer who had royal blood
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YelpBoi365,"Before you hate on Gabi and blame her for Sashas death, remember these wise words from Jean: ""Eren, Sasha died because you got the survey corps involved with this, you know""."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RD____,"So, killing Erwin was just a mistake on Zeke‚Äôs part? 

Edit: i‚Äôm a dumbass and misinterpreted what Levi said"
RD____,CapMFLevi,Bruh....üò©üòÇüòÇ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,x_TDeck_x,"Damn I was not ready for that.... Somehow I feel like the show didn't make it as emotional as it could have been though.


I'm alllll the way Fuck Marley but the scouts are kinda acting like douches to Eren. Eren and Floch seem to be the only real ones left"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vevolution,"I've never watched a worse episode of anything, as far as I remember. The only two things that made sense are Eren wrecking Reiner's face, and Sasha dying from the wound, but the latter is preceded by so much bullshit, that it didn't need to happen. Reiner grabbed Porco the same way Tony grabbed the infinity stones - how? Why did Eren leave, he was free to eat both Armored and Jaw? How and why did Gabi catch up to the zeppelin, shoot a guy mid-air in the face, manage to not lose the cord, climb the aircraft, leathaly shoot Sasha, and almost Jean, all before anybody up there did anything, but Falco managed to go with her. How is this Eren's fault? 
I hate this so much. Since episode 61 I was afraid they were going to fuck this up. First they turn Eren into a villain, then give plot armour shitty characters. This episode fucks the series up, and I don't know how they can pull themselves out of this."
vevolution,YyoungChris,"Eren goes into enemy territory. 
Forces scouts to come rescue him."
vevolution,Changlini,"The thing that gets me is that no one in the scout regiment decided to beat the little shit who got the bright idea to celebrate while inside an ACTIVE COMBAT AREA, while there's still one guy hanging from the Escape vehicle. wtf at least wait until you're outside of the Area of Operations.

Okay. I'll give you that just about everyone but maybe 5 people there are new recruits. But, still!"
Changlini,vevolution,He's been pissing me off since he saved Erwin.
vevolution,JPastori,"Yeah eren just leaving seems like poor plot armor, like he said he was out of energy but he didn‚Äôt really seem like he was out of energy. The way Gabi made it to the airship was bullshit, like she headshot a dude flying in the air from that distance while sliding? That‚Äôs some bs. 

I can see how it‚Äôs erens fault, it‚Äôs looking a lot more like eren decided to do his own thing and dragged the survey core into it. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre gonna turn him into a villain, if anything I think they‚Äôre trying to make it make sense for the entire world to attack because at this point 6/9 Titans are in the eldians hands (if you count Annie who‚Äôs a prisoner underground somewhere). And the other Titans left don‚Äôt really post the same threat level as the beast Titan, colossal Titan, and the founding/warhammer/attack Titan. I think that‚Äôs why they kinda debuffed Titans with advanced technology too that we saw in earlier episodes."
JPastori,vevolution,"If anyone looked at the open door or checked up on Lobov at any point, Sasha wouldn't have been shot. Instead, the dude who assumed Lobov was back and didn't even turn his head when asked if he heard a sound gets high and mighty with Eren. OK, if Eren didn't leave, he wouldn't need to be rescued, but Jean very much allowed Gabi climbing on-board.
As for Eren, him having ""done things that cannot be undone"" and his own team losing trust in him, plus the character development and the focus switching to Gabi, Falco, and Reiner pretty much pegs him to be the villain."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheJDUBS2,"Can anyone confirm the dialogue that Eren says after punching Reiner?
In the manga he says ""he no longer has energy"", but in subs it said either I or we no longer has energy. Makes it feel very different."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lv4_squirtle,"Wow, they planned an invasion and an escape route, but didn't expect enemies to get in, and now Sasha gets killed by an 8 year old. Genius writing ü§Æ 

Edit: Gabbi the Mary Sue, everything is served on a plate for her. Incredible. Getting those Rey vibes from Star wars.

Edit 2: how did Gabbi know how to use the 3d  maneuver gear? The first season had the platoon practicing the basics, and yet she rode it perfectly into the ship, while carrying her friend. ü§î"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Badalight,"Lol at the entire comment section missing the point of the show and being the type of person that this series is condemning. If you are still saying ""woo hoo go Eren"" after this episode, then you are not an Attack on Titan fan. You are a fan of some other show that doesn't exist. I'm sorry, but it's true. You are Floch. Imagine being Floch. That sucks.

edit: Downvoters upset that they are Floch."
Badalight,KaMeLRo,"OK, Jeff."
KaMeLRo,Badalight,"For real though, who is Jeff."
KaMeLRo,Badalight,"Ok, Floch."
Badalight,That1asianboy420,Mind explaining?
That1asianboy420,Badalight,"Yes.

So the series is conveying a very clear message right now. War is bad. No one is inherently ""good"" or ""bad."" We have now spent multiple episodes seeing the perspective of Marley citizens. Why is that? It's to humanize the characters on the other side of the conflict. We have Gabi who is a direct parallel to young Eren. Gabi kills Sasha and everyone hates her for it. Yet, Eren kills an entire plaza full of innocent civilians and he is cheered. Do you see the irony of the situation?

The characters in the manga have all pretty much realize this. That's why Eren said him and Reiner are the same. Both will commit horrible atrocities for the sake of the people they love. However, Eren's actions are only seen as noble by Floch and a few nameless survey corps members. All of his friends are upset with him; Levi, Armin, Mikasa, Hange. None of them agree with his actions.

At this point, rooting for Eren or trying to justify his actions means you are acting like the character Floch and are missing the point of the series. In no uncertain terms, the series is painting Eren as the bad guy because he perpetuates the cycle of hatred that has been part of their world from the beginning.

That's why rooting for Eren means you're not an Attack on Titan fan. Because you are cheering for the person the show is trying to condemn while disagreeing with its core messages and themes. The show where Eren's actions are not condemned does not exist. If you are not a fan of the message the show is trying to convey, then you are not a fan of the show. You are a fan of what you want the show to be.

Note: That isn't to say you can't enjoy Eren's characterization. I think he is a fantastically written character - arguably the best in the series. But there is a stark difference between enjoying him as a character and from trying to justify his actions as morally righteous."

Hate him first, then get his reasons later on. I mean we got this about Gabi in these few eps. She is the most brainwashed warrior candidate + things she witnessed and did won't be good for her mental as she is clearly going apeshit.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ikildedmemes,"Im super confused about one thing in this episode. Why didnt Eren just eat the jaw and armor before retreating. Yes he was exhausted, but could he really not make a few steps and shove them up his mouth. Its not like they were able to fight back."
Ikildedmemes,hapiscan,"I'm inclined to believe that he had a mental count of titans and having seen the other ones defeated, he knew that it was Reiner, and that menace was powerful enough to distract him from what he was about to do."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,M3rc_Nate,"I get why it was said and I think it's realistic for it to be said, but the comment about it being Eren's fault that a few people died, even Sasha is kinda dumb. What would have happened had Eren not attacked was basically the entire rest of the world declaring war on the Island and then going and attacking. A **lot** more people would have died in that war. Most certainly Sasha. 

His attack, with their assistance, got them the Warhammer powers, Zeke, they destroyed Marleys port, caused the death of Tybur and other high ranked Marleyans and they beat up all their Titan warriors. A first attack that cost 8 lives, gave them a key to overall victory and set their opponent back BIG. 

What I'm left wondering is what's the end game? What's going on with the important person who met with Tybur then left and him knowing he was going to die? Story wise it seems likely Eren will unleash the ""Rumbling"" aka turn the walls back into Titans who then run over the world killing everything. But is that the end? Does the series end with our main character and the ""good guys"" we rooted for killing everyone else on Earth in order to win? I'm not saying I'm against that, creatively it's powerful and gutsy. But I just don't know what's next. Which is good."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aragon58,I'm really liking this season so far but I'm a little confused/worried about how they're going to wrap it up in the next 8 episodes. We have barely just started to unravel the Paradis side of this new conflict and there's no clear direction for the climax yet. Is there going to be a second half to this season for a total 32 episodes? Or a second part with just 12 like s2?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,leadz579,"I'm waiting for Reiner's reaction to gabi's death. I dont know why. Will it be like ""Whatever I've killed one of you so this is nothing"" or will he regret everything"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hapiscan,"I think that Gaby is pretty interesting. Yes, she's probably kind of a spoiled kid who believes she deserves everything and her attitude towards life is quite entitled. But... Let's not forget she's an eldian in Marley, and her goal is to make eldians look good at the eyes of the world. If we think about characters just from the Paradis perspective, she's pretty obnoxious, but I feel that the author is trying to convey another perspective, and if we see her from that point of view, as Marleyan eldians, she's really interesting and invigorating. Still kind of annoying but definitely adds to the story and I totally want to see her development as a character, she's definitely got a lot of potential."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UltravioIence,"AoT reminds me of the last of us 2, showing close ups of two sides of warring factions and the way they kill each other, and then the circle of violence keeps going.

Sasha made a choice not to kill a kid a few episodes ago and for that we‚Äôll see her as a kind hearted woman who just wanted meat... but for her it meant death. 

Looking at Eren (who‚Äôs obviously coated in plot armor, but just indulge me) he becoming the anti-hero of the story. Someone who does evil things because he things because he thinks it‚Äôll bring peace to his life and his love ones."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirUlrichVonLichten," 

* I  long held onto the theory that Zeke was playing the Long Con and was on  Paradis Island's side. Looks like it was true! I'm fascinated to know  more of Zeke's story and why his allegiance is the way it is.
* Banter between Zeke and Levi was perfect.
* I'm  absolutely gutted about Sasha. The moment Gabi made it onto the  aircraft, I knew someone important was going to bite it. I thought it  was going to be Jean. Everyone's reaction to her death was  heartbreaking, but especially Eren since he knows it's his fault. For  all his stoic face stuff this seaosn, Eren is still Eren on the inside  and Sasha's death definitely hit him. Man. This show pulls absolutely no  punches."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NFLAddict,"dont know if its intentional or just the way characters are drawn, but it seems REALLY hard to recognize who is who.  I still can't tell if Armin was the person who trapped pieck. who the fuck is yelena. is that a code name for armin. who was taking the beard off. whats the point of a fake beard"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Myster_Carter,"I understand Gabi, but just annoyed she went in that ship and blasted the first person she saw with no sort of plan.. I‚Äôm really on that with Falco though because he knew that this was all a revenge attack and didn‚Äôt try harder to stop Gabi. But really in conclusion if I‚Äôm going to blame anyone for Sasha‚Äôs death, it‚Äôs Eren."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LaloKURD,her death was spoiled for me thanks to twitter but knowing who will die when gabi climbed up hurt me even more
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VRisNOTdead,Should have let Sasha eat zeke.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IWasMadeToDownVote,"Perhaps its a very unpopular opinion, but I feel as if that death makes the whole raid seem worthwile? They lost 6 members, excluding Sasha, that's insane compared to the upwards of thousands killed, including military and civilians. 7 deaths don't equate to thousands, but I feel like that death gives some meaning to all those who died in Liberio, to at least offer a bittersweet conclusion to a battle that seemed like the Eldians got off almost scot free. Anything to piss off Eren in this season seems rather satisfying, granted I don't like that she had to die, but at least there's something tangible there."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PhatDib,Everyone‚Äôs talking abt Sasha and zeke but what about Porco. Eren could‚Äôve easily just eaten him before he dipped. Also I‚Äôm hyped to see what happens with falco and gaby. It would be cool to see them switch sides and train with new eldia

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nestiik,Can someone explain why eren supposedly broke their trust? I mean it seemed like it was a coordinated attack from paradis but now it seems like he planned this all on his own. And Hange said that he purposefully made himself a hostage so that they would come and save him but he was no hostage? So does that mean that he lied to them in all of his letters or is this manga spoiler territory?
Nestiik,JooK8,"Seems like he ran away without anyone else's approval.  All he did was send letters to them telling them what he was going to do and any useful information he might be able to relay.  He then made himself hostage by exposing himself at the presentation and getting into a fight with the war hammer.  If Mikasa did not show up, surely he would have lost to the war hammer alone, and even more, Pieck/Porco would be ready to go immediately as well as the Marley army with titan-killing weaponry if there was not already a plan in place.  It was either, they leave him to get captured/killed and lose the founding/attack titan or they go save him.  He forced them to come, and they repeatedly mentioned that there was no turning back now.  

Now that it is confirmed that Zeke was on Paradis' side we can assume that Zeke + the Paradisians did not want it to come to this.  Zeke had made plans of faking a mission to Paradis where he would join up with the Paradisians.  This was mentioned and accepted by the Marley officers as his final mission.  However, he likely got news shortly thereafter that Eren was in town and planning to do something, so this was all devised.  Note that Eren snuck in as part of the soldiers with PTSD so it's not like he had already been there for a while."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aras0443,"Sasha‚Äôs death got spoiled for me like a year ago, so it didn‚Äôt rly upset me at first. But oh my god when eren started laugh/crying and they had the flashback. I cried."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kelso186,I unfortunately knew Sasha died because of spoilers. Abd I heard a lot of people were pissed about it. I feel like this could have been done way better though...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,All I can say is. I‚Äôve been right about almost everything I‚Äôve theorized so far.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"Me every Sunday:

https://i.imgur.com/UaLpJOK.png"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BleedingEdge61104,I might just have to read the manga because if I get one more major moment spoiled for me I‚Äôm gonna lose it. It‚Äôs sucking the enjoyment out of an all time great anime.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Eren‚Äôs consultation face at the end after finding out Sasha died reminded me of his face when he touched Historia at the end of season 3.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jokersuke,FUCKING ZEKE WTF
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zackywacky123321,Ok so I thought the ‚Äúmarleyan‚Äù soldier who led pieck and galliard to the well was actually Armin... but I had no idea it was a girl.  And HOW TF IS ZEKE ALL APART OF THIS.  IS HE SECRETLY GOOD (don‚Äôt tell me pls)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Falco really being the ultimate simp this episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StrangeBiird,Also I hate the new noses. They messed up Levi‚Äôs face smh.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mewmiuww,Sashaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mewmiuww,This is one anime death that I did not get any spoilers about üò¢ sashaaaaüò≠I feel like I didn‚Äôt really even have time to mourn her death since the episode ended so quickly üò©
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamal3x_,"Okay we gotta talk about Eren's reaction to Sasha's death because that was heart wrenching. He looked genuinely disturbed which is hard to express since all he's shown since he was introduced was indifference. And damn did anyone else get chills from the way Levi threatened Zeke? He didn't point swords at him or anything, but simply told him he's ready to kill him when the time is right or as he put it ""I'm the kind of person who saves the best part of his meal for last"" amazing episode as always."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Genos1de,As soon as I read the title and saw Gabi run after the airship I was already saying ‚Äúno no no‚Äù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PunjabiPakistani_,"I‚Äôm soooo confused about zeke. Is he in Marley‚Äôs side or Eldia?

What the hell. Last several years he‚Äôs been the big bad villain and now?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,internallylinked,"So, when does Part 1 of Season 4 end? Will it be broken down like 10 + 6? I thought today‚Äôs episode might be the last but I see next one is being released next week. Anyone know"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joseph31091,"damn, there goes my favorite normal human character. i was spoiled by this one but still gave me chills. they should just throw those kids."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,McBurger,"great episode but I have nowhere else to ask this, so I'll ask here.  Why is the sub shut down?  literally so many great memes & some incredible artwork and there's no comments on any of it.  every post is being locked?  is there a spoiler brigade afoot?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,i_am_really_hungry,Did we learn the name of the fake beard woman? I‚Äôm convincing myself that it‚Äôs actually Annie
i_am_really_hungry,LlamaLegacy,Jean called her Yelena
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Badalight,"I don't think that people realize that by cheering Eren on, they are basically rooting against the wishes of all of the other characters they know and love. Mikasa, Armin, Levi, Hange, Jean, Connie, Sasha. None of them wanted this. Even if you are anti-Marley, you still have to choose a side between Eren or the other characters. Sorry, you can't have your cake and eat it too."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,clever--name,The ending hit extra hard this week
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,doomsday0099,I think a lot has been spoiled by Sasha's death :(
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,marijnaua,"Sasha‚Äôs last word being meat made me laugh at first but fuck the tears came right after. Erens reaction to it was spot on. 

How the hell is this going to end is my question at this point!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hamstirly,WHAT THE FUCK
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPass,"Really thought eren would pick up the Jaw and Armored powers as well. Honestly not sure why he didn‚Äôt, he definitely had time before he had to get on the airship. I guess there‚Äôs a reason but I was looking forward to seeing him with 5 titan powers at once"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mah1122,Does anyone know why they said Eren was a hostage? I didn't understand why he was tied up and all that
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,spanner_334,Kill gabi all I'm saying
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,13lackDrag0n,Feel a bit dumb this but why is Levi angry at eren? For dragging the scouts into the war or something else? Also what were the letters eren were sending about?
13lackDrag0n,dongrizzly41,Yeah. Preety much Erin going behind d enemy lines and being a loose cannon.
13lackDrag0n,hrdp453,"I don't think it is about the war against Marley. The scouts would not have refused to that. It was about Eren going rogue and arm-twisting the scouts to follow his plan since they cannot risk losing him.

There were a lot of things that could go wrong if Eren's messages were not received or followed. Mikasa coming to save Eren, the decoy soldier leading Pieck and Galliard away, Jean and his team, Levi coming in to save Eren from the Jaw, Armin's titan at the right moment, Hange's zeppelin at the correct time. If any one of these went awry, the scouts would've lost everything."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Flabnoodles,"Damn, Gabi heard Reiner tell the potato story and really though ""I'm gonna kill her if it's the last thing I do"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kitsune-oni,"I knew it. I knew it was gonna happen, but fuck man. I didn't expect it to hurt this much."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,21Summer,"Slowest airship in the history of the universe. How a kid was able to catch up to a moving airship after is beyond me.

A show about people transforming into Titans and that‚Äôs the one part I can‚Äôt get over"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,light-warrior,Sasha's death is truly painful but i am honestly more concerned about what Eren has turned into. Levi said that Eren's eyes are just like the ones that underground criminals have. We also learn that Eren has been acting alone and betting on his friends' loyalty to him.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,date_a_languager,*holds onto my Connie a lil tighter*
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,superdolmiosauce,"And like that the anime has caught up with my knowledge of the manga, im now just as blind as everyone else is to whats gonna happen"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MBK95,"The looks between Armin, Mikasa and Eren when they were boarding the Zeppelin.

Everyone is on Eren Yeagers Wild Ride and they want off but it's too late."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rodukas,"With the aftermath of the battle, Marley will now have access to Paradis gears fro the 8 dead soldiers. They will study it and make their own 3d MG army and counter weapons..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mihir_lavande,Monke: Friendship ended with Marley. Now Eldia is my best friend.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PK_RocknRoll,"Damn, that flash back really got me TT_TT"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RobertoBigDaddy,"Pretty sure Funimation posted a spoiler on instagram about the death. They posted a cropped  picture of Sasha from an earlier season without context. I hadn't seen the episode yet but I fucking knew right away what it meant. They aren't even fucking caught up with the dub so there was not god damn reason to post it. I checked earlier and I guess they removed the post, but the damage was already done"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bored_messiah,I'm so annoyed Eren didn't eat/capture the Jaw and Armored Titans. Wouldn't have been so difficult. This really doesn't make sense.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YaboiGh0styy,Fuck you to everyone that likes to put Sasha‚Äôs death in the comment sections of videos that only briefly show or mention her.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lightsuki,"Can anyone tell me the name of the OST in the whole scene where Hange tells Eren that they have lost trust in him
Trying to find out since I heard it in season 2"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Otaku_2005,I WANT GABI‚ÄôS HEAD. NOW.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chimicu,"Question for the manga readers: at which chapter are we now in the anime? No spoilers please, just a number!"
chimicu,Irimort,Most of it is chapter 105 first few scenes from ending of 104
Irimort,JooK8,What chapter did the season start on?  Isn't there like 20 more chapters left with more to come and aren't we now halfway through the season?  Can't imagine how they're gonna fit everything in unless they plan to end with longer episodes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ridopenyo,"God damn it, even though I knew whats about to come, it still hurts... :( :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BuffalosDeigo,"Perhaps I'm just dense, but I'm confused about how, in theory, they would distribute all the titans that Eren controls. The pass down titans by having a titan eat the special titan right? Then if Eren has the attack, founder, and warhammer titan, how do they split it up now?"
BuffalosDeigo,worstluckbrian,"From what we know so far, he would have to die and not get eaten. The titans will go to random unborn Eldians."
BuffalosDeigo,JooK8,"If someone were to eat him then they'd get all his titans.  He would have to die without getting eaten (which would happen in 4 years).  I assume this is what happenedn with Ymir the founder.  She was the first titan and possessed all 9 powers, she then died 13 years later and the titans were distributed randomly with the founding titan going to who would become the royal family. 

My guess is that Eren has some plan or will devise some plan to completely remove Titans from the world."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,otheman18,I‚Äôm getting game of thrones vibes from Eran like the mother of dragons
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TobiasReimerC,"If it has been Confirmed in The Anime, does anyone know or have some guesses, If you get Extra lifetime for stealing someone elses Titan power? Like If Eren just Got another 13 years for Drinking The war hammer?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShikaTheApache,"I didn't watch episode 7 till today, so I watched 7 and 8 together. I've been left shocked and speechless after the scene where Eren used the Jaw Titan's jaw to break Lara's crystal, then I've got more shocked when Gabi shot Sasha, then the biggest shock was when I've found out that the whole thing was orchestrated by Zeke. This season have got a lot of shocking surprises and it's all started back with that epic transformation scene of Eren, and I like how it is going."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OopsRedditItAgain,I wanna know how Eren's letters got to Paradis!!!
OopsRedditItAgain,LlamaLegacy,"They didn‚Äôt have an actual mailing system to Paradis lol.

In the end of the first episode we see someone who looks like Jean in a suit in Marley. That means that the scouts were already in Marley before for whatever reason"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MMoazN,"Tbh I stopped reading the manga when sasha died, now that the anime has caught up to it I may as well continue with the story."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,downtimeredditor,"So I watched Attack on Titan long ago. And I stopped somewhere where Rob Reiss turned into a huge creature sliming his way towards a city. 

So I recently decided having heard this was the final season to watch it all and catch up. 

It got a little crazy but binged it over the weekend and got caught up. 


And I gotta say. I dunno how the fuck they are going to finish it this season. They time jumped what like 5 years into the future. Now they just attacked Marley. And we only have 8 more episodes left. 

How are they gonna close the series cause the marley revelation is intense. 

I may have to read the manga cause it feels like anime is either leaving stuff out or really summarizing a bunch of stuff. 

Also it was brilliant to make the attack in the eladian. Quarters cause in real life any major attack doesn't happen in the rich areas it's usually the really poor areas. It's why there is constant war in places like Iraq and Iran as opposed to say UAE or Saudi Arabia and such."
downtimeredditor,KaleChipz2099,If I heard correctly there‚Äôs supposed to be a season 4 pt 2
KaleChipz2099,Irimort,"I dunno, it was explicitly said anime will end the same month manga will.
That is early April. 
So best case scenario there will be a movie. Which sucks cause it means waiting like 2 or 3 years for it to come out in BD"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,creepingforresearch,So why‚Äôd they have guns drawn on Eren?
creepingforresearch,LlamaLegacy,"From the recent dialogue, they said things like ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre happy‚Äù and ‚Äúcome back home Eren‚Äù implying that this whole operation was probably part of Erens plan, not Paradis‚Äô. They didn‚Äôt want to come to Marley and attack, they had to save Eren because they didn‚Äôt want to lose the founding titan. Now that Erens off doing his own thing, they can‚Äôt trust him anymore"
creepingforresearch,JooK8,"In addition, he's likely been gone for at least a year or two, so who knows what he was up to before he actually went to Liberio.  It's implied that none of them have seen him for a long time and that they don't know what he'll do next or how he's changed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frederickdiggory,"I just realized something that I'm confused about- Eren would have had to eat his father to become the attack titan, since we know grisha got the power from the owl.. So his father is dead? He would have to have done this after the wall fell because his dad was still alive/around the day the wall fell. somebody please help me"
frederickdiggory,IBreedAlpacas,"yeah they discussed this in the first half of season 3... Grisha was given the attack titan from the Owl, then he infiltrated the walls. When the wall was first attacked, Grisha went into the church crystalized thing to eat the Coordinate. After eating the coordinate, he found Eren, injected him with the serum, and then let Eren eat him to get both titan abilities. This all happened the same day the wall fell"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Joyful_Dize,Somebody toucha my potato
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,e001mek,"Welp they killed off the main character, now we have to riot"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PrimeBilly,"On the Zeke point in the comments my theory is so even more back story - when his parents were telling him he'd be the savior of paradise they planned for him to turn them in, based on what the Owl wanted. So we'll see a flashback that this was planned hella back, just like the Owl saying Eren Mikasa Armin."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlueIvyBarter,"Twitter is on a roll with these memes XD. Have you guys seen this? If not, be prepared for this laugh üòÇ 

https://twitter.com/chrissasje/status/1356272622309437441?s=21"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kurodori_knives,was eren grieving sashs's death at the end?
kurodori_knives,JooK8,"I think he was laugh-crying for a bit remembering Sasha, then he was angry-crying after knowing she's dead."
kurodori_knives,jerrypolar,I believe so. It came off to me as reality hitting him and he finally showed some emotion because he started to think of the good ol times
jerrypolar,kurodori_knives,"Thought so. The lack of tears compared to Conny, Jean, Mikasa and Armin really stands out for me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lordnimnim,Wait why did they restrain eren
lordnimnim,jonnovision1,"From the sounds of it, Eren went rogue by getting himself captured (and has done it before?) and the only reason the scouts saved him is because they cant afford to lose the Founding Titan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ToAsTyBoI-_-,I‚Äôm halfway through and I FUCKING CALLED IT THAT GABI WAS GONNA KILL SASHA
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thehellvetica,I can't recall the lore exactly but what's preventing them from bringing sasha back maybe by giving her titan powers?(like how they did it with armin vs erwin in s3). Does the transfer have to be only when the host at the verge of death? ü§î
thehellvetica,JooK8,They have to be alive.  So unless they threw her off the ship and transformed her they'd just get everyone killed.  Assuming anyone even had any titan spinal fluid + syringe on hand.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spiced_lettuce,"Question about the colossal Titan: can they control their explosion when they transform or not because the first times Bertholt transformed in the anime there was no nuke

Also.. they took away Sasha idk if I could do this if they took away conny"
Spiced_lettuce,JooK8,"Yes, you can choose.  Bertoldt did not use his nuke power any of the times he transformed until Shiganshina.

Also, I have a feeling all of the main cast including Conny will end up getting killed one way or another.  In the end there'll probably only Eren/Armin/Mikasa or even none at all.  I could see it as being Mikasa only in the end.  She ends up losing everyone she considers family once again.  The others in the 104th are almost all gone.  Eren will be dead in 4 years and Armin will be dead in 9.  Reiner/Annie will also be dead in a year at most assuming she cares about them at all.  Something will def go wrong with Zeke, it going smoothly from here would be just too easy.  So Historia will also get dragged into it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sean_give_me_beta_no,"Levi said he would savor the ""last bite"" of revenge with zeke and such

could this be foreshadowing that levi will become the beast titan as his revenge? Since zeke doesnt have much time left and presumably survery corps can make their own titan serum now.  


Although it seems like something big is going to happen with founding titan power + royal blood so it may just be academic at this point."
Sean_give_me_beta_no,JooK8,"Idk, could be.  I sorta theorized that the reason that the Ackermans (and oriental clan) were immune to the effects of King Fritz's memory wiping power were because they were actually not of Eldian descent and the founding Titan power only worked on those connected to the coordinate, AKA other Eldians.  If that were true then Levi would not be able to transform into a Titan, however it is highly unlikely they went 100 years without breeding with an Eldian, especially considering Levi's mom worked at a brothel.  With that being said I still don't think he'd transform into a Titan unless he absolutely needed to since he is the single most effective titan killer.  If they were to need to transfer the beast titan's power, it would be more effective giving it to someone who is not as adept in human form as Levi/Mikasa."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_-Frost-Byte-_,Is it just me or do the Titans look drawn instead of cg now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,silverstyrofoam,Thanks for the heads up :(
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BanMutsang,When they say they Now we have a royal Titan are they talking about historia? And also who inherited Rod‚Äôs Titan when he died?
BanMutsang,JooK8,"Zeke has royal blood.  Historia being a royal is something they've probably hidden from Zeke which could come into play later if need be. 

Rod Reiss was a pure titan, not a titan shifter.  Here are the 9 titans and how they are passed on during the show. 

Attack Titan - Eren Kruger -> Grisha Yeager -> Eren Yeager

Female Titan - Annie Leonhart

Beast Titan - Zeke Yeager

Armored Titan - Reiner Braun

Colossal Titan - Bertoldt Hoover -> Armin Arlert

Jaw Titan - Marcel Galliard -> Ymir -> Porco Galliard

Cart Titan - Pieck Finger

War Hammer Titan - Lara Tybur -> Eren Yeager

Founding Titan - Uri Reiss -> Frita Reiss -> Grisha Yeager -> Eren Yeager"
BanMutsang,AMK2201,"He didn't say 'Royal titan'. He said we now have the Founding titan (Eren) and a titan with royal blood (Zeke has the Beast Titan and he is someone with royal blood).

As for Rod Reiss - he didn't have any of the nine titan powers. I can't remember but I think his titan was his pure titan form but it went all weird and shit. Anyway, there was no titan power to inherit as he didn't hold any of the 9 powers."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ahtkachan,Just here to say I wish Gabi has a very gruesome and violent death. Girl is annoying as fuck and not even considering anything that happened on this episode. She‚Äôs just a really tiresome character
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,antoinescotto,"Noooo not Sasha...she was the ""comic relief"" with her love of food.... Sigh"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,call_me_R3MiiX,Goes to show how far Eren has come in skill. Eren went from barely being able to carry a boulder a couple of yards to 1 tapping Reiner and killing the war hammer titan. Once he figures out how to use the abilities he‚Äôs gonna get even stronger as well
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Linguisticgummy_bear,Moment for Sasha and the commander dude (sorry I don‚Äôt remember his name) BUT WHYYYYYY DIDNT YALL PULL THE TIGGER??? Man FUCK KIDS!!! (Only when they are out for your blood. ‚ò∫Ô∏è And etc)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HeheHaha_07,Sasha I‚Äôm actually crying
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dongrizzly41,Did anyone else notice the parallel between Erin's one eye in the first few episodes and zekes one foggy glasses lens? Possible hint at them working togeather in some grand plan mabye?
dongrizzly41,TheMerryBerry,Isn‚Äôt it canon that they‚Äôre working together already based on the conversation where they were both on the zeppelin?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thedadyouneverhad,When is the full OP coming out?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,swat_xtraau,So will there not be a season 5????
swat_xtraau,Gamagosh,"hmm i wonder if ""the last season"" will be the last season??? hmmmmmmm?"
Gamagosh,swat_xtraau,No like there might be a part 2 or some shit but okay I won't ask questions
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gidrah,"Sasha: Dies
Eren: Lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bartdooster,Is it possible that Eren didn‚Äôt get the Warhammer Titans powers? And instead Porco ingested what is necessary to inherit the powers?
Bartdooster,illumantimess,Nah the way it was shot and everything with Eren consuming and reacting to the spinal fluid leaves little ambiguity
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,3JUP1T3R,Why did sasha have to die. Imagine training 4+ years just to get quick scoped by a 10 year old child soldier with family issues.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JellyBoj_16,"I expected Sasha to die as soon as Gabi gave her the 'John Wick stare' when she shot those guards...

To be fair, I'm relieved that it's out of the way so I can stop stressing about my favourite character potentially dying at every moment. Doesn't make it any less sad though.

But hey, I'm happy that she died surrounded by her friends, from a gunshot rather than being eaten or something. All I'm saying is, I expect that not every character will get a relatively tame death like that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DingoCrazy,"This last episode cements it for me that they‚Äôre going to do something big with Jean in the ending. He‚Äôs going in the complete opposite direction as the main character and has been for 4 seasons, only in S4 when Eren is turning into a dead eyed sociopath jeans still constantly reminding the audience that he‚Äôs in touch with his humanity. He has a much more prominent role this season and was the first character from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù that we saw in episode 1. Too many weird synchronicities like that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CarpenterOrdinary171,"Imagine if Reiner found out that Gabi killed Sasha...

He was talking about her previously in some dinner, he sounded like he adores his former comrade too"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,abiestraw,When I say I sobbed... I sobbed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedditDotCom_,R.I.P
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cvideek51,"Alright everyone huge theory here, and someone prolly spotted it but I bet most passed it as normal wordplay dialogue.

What if when Levi was talking to zeke on the airship, he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the kind of person who saves the best bite for last, I like the savor the taste‚Äù is legit foreshadow of Levi eating zeke instead of eren???? Or maybe eren drinks some blood but not spinal fluid so he has royal blood, but Levi takes the beast üëÄüëÄüëÄwould be a huge twist IMO"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MJohnRili,"Fuck Gabi, all my homies hate Gabi."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chimicu,"Why do some people call Eren ""Erin""? What's wrong with them?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,House-of-Spice,Meat....
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pokedyo,Will episode 9 tell us about yelena and onyankopon?i want to know who they are since I've never seen them in the previous seasons.(coming from a manga reader impersonating my old anime only self)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meat-brah,How was zeke involved with the plan? Did they talk before the end of season 3?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,idontcaretv,"To the guy who predicted Zeke being in for the long haul and still being a restorationist  


Cheers, man. You were thinking miles ahead of us"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lockstop087,Might be unpopular but I was happy about sasha
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gandeloft,Thanks Isayama on making the entire depth of Sasha span only the real of food. Extremely lacklustre. At least.. That is my opinion..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnirudhMenon94,"Man, this show reminds me a lot of The Last of Us Part 2 in the way they make you see both sides. Also, Gabi is basically like the Abby of AoT haha."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the6ixpaths,"I finally caught up to this episode - WHY, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Youve_been_Loganated,No!  Not Sasha!  NOT SASHA!!!  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOU CONNIE!!! They killed the wrong scout!!!  IT SHOULD'VE BEEN YOU CONNIE!!!!

###MANGA READERS INSTEAD HELP PROTECTING ANIME ONLIES FROM SPOILERS BY REPORTING SPOILERS IN THIS THREAD!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MapTheJap,I love the way Zeke just walks in talking shit to Levi as if he didn't get soloed in the middle of a field the last time they met
MapTheJap,verticaluzi,And got wrecked AGAIN
verticaluzi,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"‚ÄúWell, well, well, if it isn‚Äôt the consequences of my own actions.‚Äù"
MapTheJap,heartbreakhill,"Zeke: Anyone in the Survey Corps I should be cautious of?

Reiner and Berthold: Yeah, Levi will fuck you up, watch out for him

Zeke: lol okay

***Zeke and the Gang get fucked up by Levi***"
MapTheJap,bonerfleximus,"He got solod in front of all his friends too, so embarrassing."
MapTheJap,the_rootman,Dude had backup watching strictly for Levi. Nah dude this is humanity‚Äôs greatest
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the_wacky_introvert,"Just when everyone thinks they have damaged Attack Titan enough, Eren comes out like- ""ANOTHER ONE!"""
the_wacky_introvert,ca1igir1,"exactly! it makes you think how many times he‚Äôs trained on paradis. how many experiments he‚Äôs done in order to have such stamina. i wish we had filler scenes of them training, like in the cadet or of eren‚Äôs experiments, altho i understand animating those would be a b*tch"
ca1igir1,Sarazan97,An ova on that would be amazing!
ca1igir1,JooK8,"I imagine that is something that could happen later in a quick scene where they explain how Eren was so resilient in battle.  It could also be a feature of the Attack Titan, since the Attack Titan is supposed to persevere and always keep pushing forward.  Also remember that almost everything we saw from S1-S3 after the attack on Trost happened over the course of like 1 year.  Including Eren discovering that he even had titan powers.  He's obviously far more comfortable using his titan now."
ca1igir1,the_wacky_introvert,They could show like a 30 second snippet of what all happened in those 4 years with still images.. Though I do not see a situation where they would have to show that..
the_wacky_introvert,Cpt_Callisto,"The training is finally paying off, doesn't seem like the warhammer really used her abilities too much if she was that's all she had in her"
Cpt_Callisto,quinn_the_potato,She probably didn‚Äôt train as hard as the other shifters because the Tyburs never went to war like the others. She probably trained the abilities but never got to truly try them because there were no other shifters to fight.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dio-Dio-Dio,"Seeing someone as innocent as Armin, who originally just wanted to see the ocean, bear the sins of Bertholt and see the deaths of thousands of civilians is... sad? I‚Äôm happy Armin finally showed up, and his transformation was badass, but even his Titan form looks remorseful"
Dio-Dio-Dio,Darknfullofhype,"Yeah that scene left me so torn.. on one hand its sick to see armin using the colossal titan, that whole sequence was hype and i was cheering him on. But seeing the cost... oof its a big burden to bare."
Darknfullofhype,Dio-Dio-Dio,"It‚Äôs interesting how similar he is to Erwin now though, Erwin bore the weight of his own soldiers, Armin bears the weight of the civilians and Bertholdts life. I guess Armin finally abandoned something, his humanity."
Darknfullofhype,cadwellingtonsfinest,"Yeah, it's like there is NO WAY to employ the colossal titan and not get massive collateral damage, and that's I think the sad irony of armin controlling it: he's the genius precision planner, working surgically, but his titan is just a nuke and that's his fate in the story."
Dio-Dio-Dio,Busy-Ad-5167,It‚Äôs always the innocent one that gets the God of Destruction.
Dio-Dio-Dio,justaverage00,"Armin doesn't have that same ""fuck the enemy"" mentality as Eren. seeing all those dead people is definitely gonna fuck with his head as this season goes on"
Dio-Dio-Dio,MrProfPatrickPhD,"Watching him walk around in the wreckage gave me big Dr. Manhattan vibes. Armin's had such a fantastic arc, it pains me to see him like this but he's definitely the best man for the job. Anyone who'd want that power is not someone who should have it"
Dio-Dio-Dio,browniebrittle44,Yeah he just wanted to play in the sand but life had other plans...the pains of growing up ;(
Dio-Dio-Dio,Bellerinafall,"He also has the burden of living up to Erwin which is so sad. He is finally taking his own advice ""To surpass monsters, you must be willing to abandon your humanity."" To see Armin killing hundreds of people when before he hasn't even killed a Titan, he even puked when he first killed a human."
Dio-Dio-Dio,mekoomi,"I wonder if everyone else is okay with Eren's plan, even mikasa seemed sad when she said ""come back home"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MacabreMiasma,"This episode was fucking crazy. Eren is such a brutal monster now man. He always has been to some degree but this is just something else. Using Galliard‚Äôs Jaw to eat the Warhammer was fucking crazy. Kinda annoying that he didn‚Äôt just eat Galliard when he could have. Anyway it was a really good episode.
The look on Armin‚Äôs face in the boat and later when he leaves the Colossal Titan was so sad, the poor guy has such a massive kill count weighing on him now."
MacabreMiasma,Prof_Black,Scouts had such a high killstreak the last two episodes they could call in their own tactical nuke.
Prof_Black,smoking_mem_es,They did lol
MacabreMiasma,lordofthekebabs,really why didnt he just eat him there
lordofthekebabs,crimsonphoenix12,"Especially after already breaking the anime transformation rule last week, like c'mon dude"
lordofthekebabs,Chowdahhh,"I agree he probably should have just eaten him there, but given how fierce Galliard came in Eren probably wanted to be sure he was beaten down before going for eating him so Galliard wouldn't catch him off-guard at the last moment. We've seen that titan-shifters can speed up their healing by focusing on a specific body part (like Annie did in season 1 with her eye), and for all Eren knew the Jaw Titan could have a faster healing factor than the others"
lordofthekebabs,NakedBandicoot,He had to demonstrate ultimate disrespect before he killed him.
MacabreMiasma,instantclassico,I just had my jaw open for those last 10 mins. Amazing
MacabreMiasma,Bring_Me_The_Night,I think he could have used one of the claws on the arm that he brutally tossed away. It is surely more painful for poor Porco to become the tool he never wanted to be.
Bring_Me_The_Night,Neurotic_Marauder,"I thought Eren was going to use the arm he ripped off of Porco to get the War Hammer but instead he decided to use Porco himself as a makeshift nutcracker.  
 
So brutal."
Bring_Me_The_Night,chumMuppet,"because we needed a badass scene, imagine eren just hacking away at the crystal for a while trying to get to the juicy center"
Bring_Me_The_Night,lifeinthecloudz,"Well he‚Äôs called the Jaw titan for a reason, I don‚Äôt think using his arm would have worked"
Bring_Me_The_Night,DrognaDice,"Really though, he and the other warriors have had no choice but to be Marley's tools for like 100 years."
MacabreMiasma,Neurotic_Marauder,"The burden of the Colossal seems to be the realization of the mass amount of death they are able to wreak with such little effort.    
 
Only until right before his death did Bertholdt seem to be constantly guilt-ridden about how he destroyed the wall.  
  
It seems now that Armin will be in the same kind of moral predicament."
MacabreMiasma,AbaramaGolding,"I had a huge problem with Eren in the beginning seasons because I felt he was always crying...but now he is the total badass that we wanted.

Also, like you said he should've just ate Gilliard. In last weeks episode he didn't hesitate to beat up the Warhammer titan during transformation, but this week he wants to play around with Galliard? Doesn't make sense"
AbaramaGolding,OOM-32,"Idk, but maybe assimilating titan powers has a cooldown or isn't easy and instant to do. Galliard's titan hardening on his teeth might not transfer fast enough for Eren to kill the warhammer by himself, so he did the second best thing, use him as a tool."
AbaramaGolding,Reggie_156789,i never understand people who hate Eren in the earlier seasons sure he was a little annoying at times and let his emotions get the best of him but he was a kid lol what do expect him to be a mature badass right away? i think Eren truly is a great written character and has had an amazing character development.
AbaramaGolding,TerminatorReborn,"The Warhammer titan was the priority, isn't it the strongest titan on combat?? The legend says the Warhammer defeated the other titans 1v8, no way it was worth to risk not having it by eating the Jaw witch I think is the weakest titan shifter"
MacabreMiasma,shifty1032231,Eren still did nothing wrong
shifty1032231,liebs13,"RT, he‚Äôs moving forward and he‚Äôs only responding what‚Äôs been done to him first"
shifty1032231,JESquirrel,It is crazy how many fans switched sides just because we get some backstory on the actual bad guys.
shifty1032231,Kevinc62,"He absolutely did many wrong things here. Killing many, many civilians. So did Reiner/Bert/Annie. Eren himself knows he's wrong but he is fine with it and does not care and just wants to move forward. That's the whole point of the conversation with Reiner: they are the same."
MacabreMiasma,JooK8,"Yes since he wasn't playing by the rules and punched the war hammer in the face last episode during transformation, I was disappointed that he didn't just eat Porco right away when Reiner transformed.  He certainly had time to."
MacabreMiasma,brodycartwrightt,I feel so bad for Armin. I was excited to see his colossal but then realized how sad he is and he wanted to be free of this burden. I think his character is going to be an interesting case this season
MacabreMiasma,imchillinboo,yea the jaw titan was a real blue balls moment
MacabreMiasma,NyanPotato,"Remember when eren was a sweet innocent child?

Cuz I don't"
MacabreMiasma,MrMxylptlyk,"Yeah I wish that was animated a bit tighter to show that eren had no chance to get at galliard, the armored like swatted him away or something lol"
MacabreMiasma,DirtyAngelToes,"I believe Galliard was nestled inside the jaws that Eren couldn't get through, so that's more than likely why he didn't eat him right away. He needed to get Galliard out, either through harming him enough that he exited his titan body or some other method."
DirtyAngelToes,TarAldarion,He can just pull him out through the back of the neck.
MacabreMiasma,NoodlesForeverAlways,I was screaming at him to hurry up and eat Galliard before Reiner transformed. Damnit what happened to that no waiting until they‚Äôre transformed energy he had for the Warhammer Titan in the last episode?!
MacabreMiasma,Mirikado,Calm Eren is actually terrifying. He doesn‚Äôt rage and rush recklessly into battles while yelling his lungs out anymore. Dude is so cool-headed and observant now. He immediately learns the weakness of a Titan the first time he fought it. Years of being a cripple in that hospital certainly changed him.
MacabreMiasma,browniebrittle44,Eren finally has control of his emotions and Titan‚Äîall just to murder people. I like that his character growth is a descent. (Makes me kinda sad ngl)
MacabreMiasma,not_a_weeeb,"fr, eren looks so cold this season, far from what he used to be and i like it"
MacabreMiasma,-mi_h_ir-,Seeing Eren now I think if he doesn't find a way to win he'll definitely use rumbling.
MacabreMiasma,chronoboy1985,"Is there a reason why Colossal Armin looks so different compared to when he first transformed last season. Back then he looked like a giant emaciated bulimic kid. But in this episode he looked a lot more like Berthold, if a bit less boxy. Is there a precedence that as people become better at using their Titan or as they age, their Titan appearance matures/evolves? 

Or was that just MAPPAs interpretation?"
chronoboy1985,CMDR_1,"When you first see Armin turn into a titan last season, he was just transformed by the serum. After he transformed, he was fed Berthold and gained the power of the Colossal Titan - that's why he looks like the Colossal now. 

Even Eren looked like a kid when he first transformed, then he ate his father and gained the Attack Titan which is what manifests now when he transforms. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbO5LsDoOT4"
MacabreMiasma,DoktorSleepless,Not even Berhtold used his nuke powers against civilians. Armin is pure evil.
DoktorSleepless,JingleFett,"Except Armin didn't use it against civilians, he used it against the enemy fleet of battleships and some civilians died in the crossfire. Bert on the other hand used his titan to bust down the wall, for the specific purpose of killing civilians, leading to about 250,000 or so civilian deaths, more if you count all the deaths that happened as a consequence of those events.

That's also not counting the cities Bert nuked before going to Paradis, when Marley was going around conquering other nations, which we saw in the flashbacks.

And on top of that, Bertholdt/Marley was using his powers to conquer other nations, whereas Paradis is in a kill or be killed situation--they didn't ask for this, they didn't start it, but they know they have to be the ones that end it."
MacabreMiasma,S_targaryen,The worst part is that they've gained full control of their island and no one's visited there since 4 years so there are no titans. They could have lived their lives peacefully on the island. But Eren chose revenge.
S_targaryen,philosophyofuranus,"Bro, what? 
This whole season has been about Marley plotting to attack Paradis again. Did you not watch the episode where the Brass was talking about the scout ships they have been sending to Paradis? 
The only reason it wasn't a full out attack again was because Marley was fighting another war during those 4 years. But they were still very much actively fucking with Paradis. Also, Eren was definitely not alone in this. Maybe he went a bit out of the tracks but there was definitely a plan being carried out by the rest."
MacabreMiasma,alansir,That suspense builder man
MacabreMiasma,arvinkb,"I thought he was gonna make Galliard eat the Warhammer, then eat Galliard"
MacabreMiasma,chronoboy1985,"He made the same mistake they all do:

‚ÄúHey Armin! Don‚Äôt look down!‚Äù

Armin immediately looks down and sees miles of rubble, crushed and mangled bodies and one boy trapped under debris staring up at him in terror. And Armin‚Äôs heart collapsed in on itself from the unfathomable grief. 

‚ÄúHey man. I told you, but you did it anyway, didn‚Äôt ya?‚Äù"
MacabreMiasma,stormingwinter,The madlad used the Jaw Titan as a nutcracker
MacabreMiasma,Golmax,I‚Äôm kinda scared that eren will just become completely numb to killing and become the villain
Golmax,AJ_Dali,"I think his goal is similar to the Chosen Undead and Persistent Skeleton (not their real title) from Dark Souls. Aquire all the power and either use it or lock it away (depends on the ending). They mentioned that if one of the Nine dies then a child is born with the power. 

Which I think means that either Armin or Eren will have to eat each other."
MacabreMiasma,uranthus,Seems to be more powerful that Bergholt Collosal? He took out an entire harbour and most of the edge of time by just transforming.
MacabreMiasma,Redditer51,"This episode was insane. 

The biggest shock is that Eren went from a shouting overemotional idiot, to a cold, brutal, calculating genius. Eren's smart now, dude! Its like he went from shonen hero to shonen villain. He went from being Gon to being the Chimera Ant King. That part where he forced Galliard to kill War Hammer was legitimately shocking.

He essentially became the very thing he swore to destroy (even though a lot of the Marleyans deserved it. Not the innocent children though). 

As for Armin, like Eren with Reiner, now he's come to understand through experience what Bertolt had to go through."
MacabreMiasma,NOOBSDUDETO,"when you let other people especially normal civilians get in your way, you get nothing done. this is why most shonen fights are hard.

attack on titan has many themes and morales that are worth learning. not particularly this one but something like, you arent always the good guy."
MacabreMiasma,frenchfries089,"To go from being heavily guilty in Season 3 Episode 1 to being literally ok to have a More massive kill count including kids and innocent people just working and minding their business.

Even the first human kill he got was just a soldier and was guilty like I said."
MacabreMiasma,ClashGod32,"hit everything I was thinking. Eren literally punching the living hell out of everyone for 20 seconds straight was rather scary to see, like man he turned into a straight savage. Plus he‚Äôs got the long hair and beard going, just a totally different person now. But, when the titans invaded their walls, they deserve this. Armins scene was very sad to see, as someone else said in the comments, all he wanted to do was see the ocean, and now he‚Äôs in the ocean turning into a gigantic titan killing (possible) innocent lives who were just living and wanted no part of this. Overall, bad ass episode, crazy episode, can‚Äôt wait for the next one!!!"
MacabreMiasma,Jeffotato,"I wouldn't even of thought to do that, I assumed he was going to eat the jaw titan and then use the power to eat the warhammer."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mega__lul,"I love how you after Eren blocked Porco using the üêö, the camera zoomed in right on the Warhammer and you can immediately tell that she knows exactly what Eren was thinking as well."
Mega__lul,YamFor,I wonder how long it‚Äôll take for Eren to use his new warhammer powers
YamFor,sylveonstarr,"Eren is fucking OP, man. He has the power of three Titans now, right? I doubt anyone's wielded that many Titan Powers at once since Ymir herself."
Mega__lul,naebae19,The warhammer this entire episode: üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄü•∫
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mega__lul,Porco was so aggressive this episode and he ended up taking the fattest L
Mega__lul,Prof_Black,Porco never saw the Scouts in action. He underestimated them in every turn.
Prof_Black,Pancake__Prince,Yeah he‚Äôs the only one to have never seen them. I think he‚Äôs also gonna stop being such a bitch towards to Reiner since Reiner saved him at the end.
Prof_Black,WirelessShit,"Oh boy, the only thing I could think was ""YALL BEEN FEEDING THEM WITH TITANS YALL GONNA SEE THE TRUE POWER"" but at the beginning of the ep it was kinda sad to see them fall. The way eren owned porco was amazing tho."
Mega__lul,Pardusco,Even Pieck knew his recklessness would bite him in the ass.
Pardusco,TheOldNewGraig,"Actually his recklessness bit someone else in the ass. 

*Finger guns*"
Mega__lul,verticaluzi,"As much as I dislike Porco, he was looking badass this episode"
verticaluzi,Mega__lul,"Yup , he was putting in that work against Eren but like Pieck told him he‚Äôs so agitated and impatient. Why do you dislike Porco ? Personally I don‚Äôt really dislike any of the warriors anymore but I have a better ‚Äòconnection‚Äô with the people of Paradis Island so I‚Äôll root for them."
Mega__lul,PK_RocknRoll,That‚Äôs what he gets for underestimating his opponents a second time
BlTCHniqqa,lonniewalkerstan,He detonated a grenade while he was standing on top of Zeke and it didn‚Äôt show him moving away. Led me to believe it was a suicide but that doesn‚Äôt seem like Levi
massi1008,Kawaii-nani,"Just a quick correction, they don't want revenge they want freedom. The conversation between Eren and Reiner pretty much proved that."
illumantimess,SheuiPauChe,Lmaooo definitely
Neurotic_Marauder,BlazingSpaceGhost,Armin killed thousands and it was awful but he was hitting a military target (the navy) had they not destroyed the navy then Paradis would have been screwed.
Neurotic_Marauder,zeek215,Are they war crimes though? Marley declared war on them right before Eren first transformed. This is what war is.
LemonNitrate,SheuiPauChe,"Totally fair. I share your sentiment but I guess I see why they needed to do it from their perspective. Everything has to go perfectly during the attack or the same, if not worse, would happen to Paradis."
sylveonstarr,SheuiPauChe,Batman Levi doesn't sound too bad tbh
DrPikachu-PhD,SheuiPauChe,I think what makes things warcrimes is precisely that they happened during war
SourTomato1040,darkmarineblue,Grenade. Like the one that was thrown on Magath last episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrispierCupid,Eren really just turned Porco into a nutcracker
CrispierCupid,OOM-32,"Worse, a limbless nutcraker"
OOM-32,Shreddies123,Porco 'nugget' the nutcracker
CrispierCupid,Clumulus,NUTCRACKER TITAN
CrispierCupid,Dio-Dio-Dio,"That means he can use the jaw Titan on Annie too, or maybe they already found a way to get Annie out. Eren did mention Annie and how his teeth couldn‚Äôt pierce the crystal, which means they are most definitely working on or have gotten Annie out of the crystal"
Dio-Dio-Dio,Shreddies123,Looks like they can crack it with the explosives they have. If they steal some syrum as well... Historia + Female Titan + Eren = ü§îü§î
Dio-Dio-Dio,xellospm,If he would hurry up and eat porco!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mallubojack,"The episode was fucking epic. Puberty hit Armin hard. What an intro, also sad to see the regret in his eyes.

 Was expecting to see more of Levi vs Beast but I guess it's not over yet.

1) Porco. Dude was so turnt up and acting so reckless the whole episode just to get turned into a nut cracker in the end.

2) Monke titan;  dude was like ‚ÄúEren is no match for me‚Äù . Should‚Äôve kept his attention strictly on his dad Levi.

3) The Navy; they probably had so many strategies planned out to corner the people of Paradis Island. All that just to get one shot by Armin. You hate to see it."

Hdplvemealone,Meshary-G,Her scenes inside the crystal were amazing. You can see the struggle and fear in her eyes. Fucking loved this episode.

Mega__lul,blubat26,"I love how they took out Zeke. No build up like last time, the focus is on Pieck and then we see Zeke just fall. Levi with that sneak attack ending the Marley Hype Beast like theyre fodder."
blubat26,STEELCITY1989,I feel like he's in on it honestly. He got lead away and we haven't seen any of that yet. They tried to trap the others and succeeded why not trap him down there as well? He bails and makes everyone think he's dead for a reveal later.
blubat26,souaiway,THE MARLEY HYPEBEAST
blubat26,DaftMaetel15,"I'm confused though, did Levi go suicide bomber to finish Zeke, I don't remember seeing him after that scene in the episode."
blubat26,Teves3D,No villain monologue just set the nade and dip üò≠üò≠
blubat26,not_a_weeeb,why didnt zeke just put a constant hardening around his nape knowing levi was just around targeting him
blubat26,vvvvfl,"there was definitely something funny about that.   


There is no chance in hell they spent all this time developing this guy just so he dies basically off camera."
blubat26,flappydicks,Okay is it safe to say zeke is dead??
blubat26,nomindbody,IDK I was hoping for Levi to slice him up from head to toe like he almost did last time which left Zeke petrified with fear. Would have been a nice call back to that point and the skill that Levi has.
blubat26,nxckg04,"Still remember that he‚Äôs the only titan that we didn‚Äôt see for the rest of the episode. I think Zeke it still inside, just crazy injured"
blubat26,gigi_1803,But we're not sure if Zeke died. Maybe he'll return
blubat26,TribalMolasses,It looked like levi killed himself in the blast?
blubat26,Hoboryufeet,"Is he actually dead though? These titans tend to only actually die when eaten? After Reiners' consciousness shenanigans in season 3 I'm never sure whose actually dead. Loved it tho, zeke gets to throw his weight around and get called the War Chief like he's this total badass and gets slapped by a human... Well if we can still call Levi a human at this point."
blubat26,Raidomso,"Didn't Zeke go out too easily? He even KNEW Levi was coming, as he directly addresses him having little time. I think Zeke had left the Titan body already by the time Levi struck it down, to make them believe they had beaten the beast titan."
Mega__lul,ForShotgun,"> his dad Levi

which fanfic is this"
Mega__lul,NedStarkGetsExecuted,">Monke titan;  dude was like ‚ÄúEren is no match for me‚Äù . Should‚Äôve kept his attention strictly on his dad Levi.

I thought it was the opposite. He said soemthing along the lines of ""Eren is not my enemy, captian Levi is."" He was specifically out of the Eren fight so that he could kill Levi as soon as he appeared. Unfortunately for him Levi synced his attack with the explosion from the Colossal titan, hence why Levi was staring at his watch."
Mega__lul,Neurotic_Marauder,"Pieck was the MVP for Marley's side, even if she got destroyed by Sasha and the Scouts.  
 
She was the only one able to surmise Paradis' plans to a point.    

What none of them accounted for was Armin and Hange's plan.    
They also didn't account for Levi going God mode over his vendetta against Zeke and bypassing Porco and Pieck entirely with little effort."

MapleLeafsFan3,Dhahockey123,How is he able to just transform 3x in rapid succession?
Dhahockey123,Qsaaad2,Practicing for years
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FHI_iSmile,I can't believe I'm just watching a masterpiece being made right in front of my eyes. Every episode is a banger. One thing people don't talk enough about is Mappa's art style. Everyone looks so good.
FHI_iSmile,sansaofhousestark99,"Did you notice how they made Mikasa's face more feminine, like how it's supposed to be in the manga as well? They got rid of Levi's puffy cheeks. Armin looks fucking fresh, almost looks like the main character of a Hollywood shooter. The animation was literally the best so far in Season 4.

>I can't believe I'm just watching a masterpiece being made right in front of my eyes. 

Bro same. My patience is wearing out week by week. I gave a lot of shit to MAPPA for not including the amazing music and animation that AOT is known for, but what the fuck? They listened to literally all my complaints man. I couldn't be happier."
FHI_iSmile,Gameburn,"The greatest Mech anime created. 

Fleshy mechs"
FHI_iSmile,-HeisenBird-,I'm coming around on the art style for the normal scenes. The Colossal standing over the rubble looked gorgeous. The CGI also allowed for more dynamic action scenes with the titans (Especially the Jaw). But some of the more slower scenes with the titans don't look that great. Eren's titan looks awful.
-HeisenBird-,TheHotCake,"Yea Eren's titan didnt look ""awful"" IMO but there are moments when he's not moving and just looking at something or moving his eyes around or what have you and THAT'S when the whole ""slower framerate"" thing comes to mind. I really wish they would have had the time to just hand draw the titans when they're barely moving in a scene. It doesn't make sense that they have to use CGI on titans for non action scenes (other than the production team gave them absolutely no fucking time to get this season done, dammit)"
FHI_iSmile,Hadvor,"I don't care for the direction they went with how the characters look. They don't feel like the same kids that we all watched grow up. How long has it been between this season and last? A year or two? The characters have seemingly changed alot, and not in ways that could be explained with aging. 

I didn't even recognize Jean, his hair and face seem so different. Except for Reiner, I feel like they stuck with the original character design but made him older."
Hadvor,Fine-Poetry-176,"Story wise it‚Äôs been a full four years, so yes- they don‚Äôt look like the same kids anymore as they are now four years older."
Hadvor,Cybernetic343,"I can‚Äôt recognise anyone, it‚Äôs really getting on my nerves. Everyone having the same hair cut is really throwing me off. I watched the first 3 seasons dubbbed too so I can‚Äôt even go by voices right now."
FHI_iSmile,ultimateshadowarrior,"I can easily tell when they use CGI and imo it's obviously worse than hand drawn, but I understand that they do it like that to save costs or meet a deadline, so it's okay. Also it's not the worst that I've seen."
ultimateshadowarrior,TheHotCake,"My thinking exactly. The company who owns the anime rights to AoT really fucked MAPPA over by giving them such little time to get this season out. Should have been delayed until this fall, at least. Then they might've had time to at least have the main titans be hand drawn."
FHI_iSmile,ApexGallery,Where was the CGI in this episode?! The entire thing was amazingly done and I didn't notice anything CGI related whatsoever
ApexGallery,Astarion,As much shit as people give Mappa's CGI its actually pretty good. There were a lot of shots in this episode that I thought were 2D at first.
ApexGallery,DOOMFOOL,"I mean I loved this episode but you didn‚Äôt pay attention then. Beast Titan was cgi for all but maybe the shot of him falling down, jaw vs attack Titan was cgi, cart Titan was cgi, etc."
FHI_iSmile,PyroJack24,"The CGI though, I mean it's not horrible CGI but it's still off though Mappa did a good job."
PyroJack24,FHI_iSmile,"The CGI can be a bit jarring and I would 100% have preferred everything to be hand drawn, but it doesn't really bother my enjoyment at all. This is easily the best CGI I've seen in anime and it's close enough imo. Can't have everything we want i guess."
PyroJack24,xXCumLordXx,I literally can't tell what is what.
PyroJack24,tunablepizza,"yeah i thought the episode was great and I don't mind CGI titans, but the CGI scout movement seems a bit stiff, they just sort of stay in place and move forwards"
PyroJack24,Mr_Pleasant2310,"I think I've pretty much gotten used to the CGI now, so I'm not distracted by it. Would have been cool if it was all handdrawn, but it still looks good overall imo so I'm happy"
PyroJack24,DOOMFOOL,It bothered me a lot last episode but this one it was done SO much better it honestly freaked me out
FHI_iSmile,mighty__orbot,"I still can‚Äôt get used to how recognizable every individual character on this show is, even after four years, when your average anime expects you to tell everyone apart just by their hairstyles."
FHI_iSmile,vis1onary,It feels as if MAPPA spent their entire budget on Jujutsu Kaisen and left the scraps for this AOT season. The animation in jujutsu is honestly insane compared to AOT. Especially the new intro
vis1onary,TheHotCake,"It's the people who own the franchise of AoT who are to blame IMO, not MAPPA. Why would they risk ruining their reputation by botching one of the biggest anime franchises ever? To me, the core of the problem of the CGI and rushed animation is this artificial deadline that S4 had to come out when it did. Why couldn't it have come out after the manga finished? Why not wait until the Fall?"
FHI_iSmile,ronalk,"CGI looks awful in my opinion. Storywise,music,choreography, dialogs all are in next level as always. Just imagine all this fights being animated just like the Beast Titan vs Levi. Goddamn."
FHI_iSmile,Hikapoo,"> One thing people don't talk enough about is Mappa's art style

It's so much worse than WITs art style tho."
Hikapoo,Busteray,"I actually like the art style and hate the animation.

The art style change doesn't really break the show's immersion as the characters all are 4 years older now. 

And older characters like Zeke who shouldn't have changed much in 4 years because they are older, well, haven't changed much."
FHI_iSmile,Kermit_Memelord,And the chromatic abberation type effect around the frames are perfect
FHI_iSmile,MoreMegadeth,The 3D parts really worked for me this episode.
FHI_iSmile,the_rootman,Same. These to be continued happen so fast and Sunday‚Äôs are so slow :[
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tomas481516,"Reiner arc is just so depressing, the man just need a big warm hug ffs."
Tomas481516,Prof_Black,After this episode Porco can no longer grief Reiner about ptsd.
Prof_Black,dtape467,Porco is going to get ptsd every time he sees a nutcracker
Tomas481516,Shreddies123,Honestly just feel so bad for him at his point. Death would just be a mercy.
Shreddies123,PK_RocknRoll,"Isayama seems content making Reiner‚Äôs life a living hell.

Reiner: ‚Äúthe bell rang, may I be dismissed?‚Äù

Isayama: ‚Äúthe bell doesn‚Äôt dismiss you, I do‚Äù"
Shreddies123,daydreamin511,He‚Äôs at his wits end because he realizes that there isn‚Äôt a good or bad side and he realized that the cause he was fighting for ultimately caused the destruction of the the same place he was fighting for. I bet if Annie or Bert was still alive they‚Äôd share the same sentiments.
Tomas481516,instantclassico,Applaud the story for showing reiner's war on the battlefield and with himself.  It really captures that fight with depression and the call for you to finally stand up to it.
instantclassico,MarianneThornberry,"Agreed. A lot of manga readers saying Eren is the best character, just to wait and see blah blah. 

But honestly, so far seeing Reiner in these last 4 seasons and his  brutal cognitive dissonance between actually loving his comrades at Paradis which are meant to be his enemy, and him being so miserable in Marley, despite feeling obligated to serve his country and the insane amount of internal conflict. How he casually blew his and Bert's cover because he was so emotionally defeated, and even just how he recounts his experiences in Paradis to his family, describing them as ""devils"" despite having nothing inherently negative to say. And wanting to die but forcing himself to keep moving forward for the kids. 

It absolutely shatters my heart watching this dude, he's literally going through an ego death. He is by far the most compelling character imo."
Tomas481516,jojo_not10,"If you told me Riener would grow in me last year, I'd think you're crazy.. but man this season is just getting soooo good!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ademola234,That warhammer kill the most savage shit i ever seen in my life
ademola234,JonOfDoom,"Also the ""oh shit i can't do anything"" straight stare of Warhammer Girl was intense"
ademola234,quinn_the_potato,It‚Äôs up there with him going ballistic on Annie
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,imohao,Why is no one talking about Zeke? Did he die?
imohao,OOM-32,"I think he's an asset to paradis forces, considering he's a royal titan. They wouldn't want to kill him.

Only maim him and maintain him at the verge of death."
OOM-32,worstluckbrian,The Owl 2.0
imohao,DeadZeus007,Something seems off... Levi vs Zeke was set up as a rivalry... I mean.. he PROMISED Erwin he would destroy the Beast Titan... I can't imagine he would kill Zeke without some speech about how he finally fulfilled his promise...
DeadZeus007,imohao,"The fact that it happened so suddenly makes me think that it isn't over for Zeke yet, he might have something up his sleeve."
DeadZeus007,MapTheJap,Levi is pretty notoriously not a speech type of person. It's pretty likely that he'd just get it done without pretty flourishes
imohao,L1uQ,"I'm pretty sure he is still alive. We did not see him die, we did not see were the soldiers took him in episode 5, and he knew that Lewi was waiting for the right moment. Also i swear he winked at Lewi in the beginning of the episode."
L1uQ,imohao,"That's why I can't be certain that he died, they definitely have something coming regarding Zeke, I will have to rewatch for that wink, cause if he did actually wink, I'll stop thinking and just wait for the next episode lol."
imohao,anbsmxms,Probably buy I wonder why would no one eat him.
anbsmxms,imohao,"I'm thinking Levi is planning to eat him, but there might be more to come from Zeke who knows"
imohao,jebascho,"> Did he die?

""You know, it was really unclear."" - Sokka"
imohao,Bring_Me_The_Night,"I wouldn't be surprised if he still alive, merely because this series takes pleasure to confirm deaths and his wasn't confirmed."
imohao,Pardusco,I think Levi might have taken Zeke out for Eren to eat later.
Pardusco,SalamanderSylph,It does seem a little risky to put all the Titan eggs in one basket.
imohao,Crosroad,No way they‚Äôd kill off someone who is seemingly important with a random grenade to the neck and leaving like nothing.
imohao,SirSpits,"The thing is, is killing them the goal? Killing Zeke would mean the beast would go to someone random. That doesn‚Äôt seem extremely helpful. 

My guess is the explosion was a distraction to capture Zeke, and what was that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre running out of time‚Äù line. Could Zeke be working with them????"
SirSpits,dolphinflip,Yeah at first I thought the running out of time line was referring to how he‚Äôs not gonna be alive much longer because of the curse of ymir but I‚Äôm starting to think he might have been talking about there‚Äôs not much time left until hange shows up for the extraction.
SirSpits,One_Eyed_Sneasel,"You‚Äôre right, but I bet there are more eldians on paradise so there‚Äôs a higher chance paradis would get the titan form if zeke died anyway."
imohao,Cold_Leadership,Yeah he got grenaded
imohao,BurnStar4,It very much looks like he should be dead but I feel like the lack of visible corpse might mean he's still around to some degree. Time will tell!
imohao,switchblade2,I doubt it. Remember in S3 when Reiner survived his nape being cut because Zeke taught him to transfer his consciousness to the rest of his body? I think that is what happened here.
imohao,Neurotic_Marauder,"I don't think so.  It would be weird for such an important character to be killed off so nonchalantly.

 
I think he's still alive, if not just barely."
imohao,Ben800m,I think he‚Äôs alive for eren to consume
imohao,saltrxn,"The season four trailer has him fighting Levi again if you slow it down. So nah he‚Äôs not dead. Rule of thumb, if you don‚Äôt see the body, then they‚Äôre not dead."
imohao,MoreMegadeth,"So Zeke in titan form doesnt move or react facially to Pieck‚Äôs warning, and they dont show any dead body or parts afterwards. I imagine he left his body before Levi‚Äôs attack, anticipating their lost leverage?"
imohao,illumantimess,"My theory is that Zeke already switched sides and this was part of the extrication plan for him, also let him fake his death"
imohao,Ife2105,Highly doubt he did. They didn‚Äôt show his body.
imohao,musti2000,You will find out next episode what happened to zeke. I'm not gonna spoil ahha
imohao,slapthatbch,Wouldnt make sense to kill zeke... probabaly escaped or got captured.
imohao,Devoun,I think people are missing that we saw Zeke in the season 4 trailer being carried by titans in a forest while being pursued by Levi. I highly doubt Zeke is dead
imohao,StupidNSFW,I‚Äôm pretty sure they captured him whenever Levi chucked that grenade at the nape.
imohao,Chowdahhh,"I'm assuming Zeke is still alive, some of the Marlyans have to live for the show to continue (I'm not a manga reader but I peaked at the manga and there are still like 30 chapters to go)"
imohao,geraltgalvestone,"I think what happened was, Levi pulled the grenade. Took Zeke and escaped carrying him. Now he'll want to gather more intel from him."
imohao,jeramiatheaberator,DO you really think they could resist stretching his death out for 15 minutes?
imohao,Projeffboy,keep him alive so that if eren touches him he can activate the founding titan power
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I-like-winds,"that felt like 5 mins wtffffff

Porco massive L"
I-like-winds,Dio-Dio-Dio,"Porco was pretty effective at first, then Mikasa straight up chopped his legs off. Then yeah... he got used as a tool, really humiliating"
Dio-Dio-Dio,DangerZoneh,"I think the fact that Eren had to use him as a tool implies that Annie is alive, yes?"
I-like-winds,supernoodle15,Marleyan Navy biggest L
I-like-winds,MASISCH,All flame no fire
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamal3x_,"Did anyone else get a feeling of satisfaction when the Survey Corps started going crazy attacking the warriors?! I got a sense of ""that's what y'all get"" because everyone in Marley thought Zeke was unstoppable until he got wrecked and seeing Pieck get blasted to bits as well. Finally Porco letting loose because he's in grief and doesn't know what else to do. There was so much action and it was so worth it!"
iamal3x_,uranthus,Even Pieck being like 'the paradis forces won't win against us in war' even though she's met them and seen what they can do. It's a huge underestimate on her part.
uranthus,Replay1986,"She wasn't wrong, though. Paradis can win battles, sure, but only on their turf, with rules of engagement in their favor. Their citizens aren't trained that way and they don't have the numbers to just throw people into the meat grinder like Marley can.

Even in this episode, the plan was ""hit these targets and get out before their army shows up in force."""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,verticaluzi,**WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT PIECK‚ÄôS CREEPY DEMON VOICE. HOW IS SHE EVEN ABLE TO TALK?**
verticaluzi,Jubilantyou,"Omg yes, I was so thankful when it cut to Pieck talking from inside the titan"
verticaluzi,Nickthiccboi,"She talks in S3 too though, this isn‚Äôt the first time"
verticaluzi,sassyaspho,Lmao! True though! I was creeped out by her voice too
verticaluzi,fadeinthelight,"I like her demonic voice. Also it makes sense in a way, imagine if the monstrosity we know as Cart Titan had Pieck‚Äôs soft and sweet voice lmao"
verticaluzi,Bearaucracy,"Same way Beast Titan can, it probably takes some effort to learn and the other titans never bothered"
Bearaucracy,diegodeadeye,"The only titans we've seen being able to talk are those with lips. Every titan with lips can talk, with the exception of Annie's Female. I guess it's something you can learn but it depends on your specific titan's physiology"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LordSprinkleman,"Eren has crazy stamina, transforming three times in a row, damn"
LordSprinkleman,undersight,If he ate the Cart Titan he‚Äôd be unstoppable with unlimited stamina.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KaMeLRo,I was so scared that Jaw Titan gonna eat Warhammer Titan instead of Eren. lol
KaMeLRo,danmathe123,Na he was holding him a way that would have stopped the jaw from swallowing. The food fell into Eren‚Äôs mouth so it‚Äôs all good
danmathe123,superseeker102,Food
KaMeLRo,PyroJack24,Well Eren could just eat him after so it's all good.
KaMeLRo,Hampamatta,"what a big dud the war hammer titan was.

so how will the erens new power manifest?"
Hampamatta,magnus91,Think its more that WarHammer had never fought another Titan before. The paradis forces are OP vs Titans cause that's all they do. Plus WarHammer was hardly a warrior.
KaMeLRo,Neurotic_Marauder,For a second there I thought Jaw was going to eat Warhammer and then Eren was going to eat Jaw lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,L1GHTG30,"Goddamn. This episode just... I cannot express how good this episode was. Jean was cold just shooting without caring that Falco was there and he managed to completely decimate the cart Titan, mikasa with the swords just slicing off both of the jaw Titans legs was amazing. Eren is as smart as ever it almost feels like I‚Äôm watching armin and eren just isn‚Äôt rocked by anything anymore, if anything that scene with him tearing the jaw Titan apart was brutal and the way he used his head to break the crystal was kinda hard to watch (in a good way). Levi taking down the beast Titan like any other Titan is golden and armin coming in with the colossal, damn, he just blew everyone away and all whilst still looking better than ever. I just cannot wait till the next episode to see how far things are taken."
L1GHTG30,LuiTurbo,"Armin probably feels exactly like Bert did. He doesn‚Äôt want to do this. Ironically earlier this morning I got suggested the video of when they captured Eren, and Bert & the rest of the crew was riding on Reiners back. Bert said they were forced into all of it. I‚Äôm sure Armin feels the same way considering it wasn‚Äôt his choice to receive the colossal nor was it really his choice to take over for Erwin."
L1GHTG30,Kuhlayre,Let's not forget Sasha shooting a guy between the eyes. She's come a long way from offering to share her potato!
antrix_AFC,KingKRhule,"I didn't think about the ball and glove! That seems like an obvious nod to Zeke. Agreed with you on 3. It was implied he was trapped but, like his death, we never see it. Another comment also points out that 8) Eren also scratches his head like Zeke does. If this is true they've done a good job of sowing small seeds this season"
DoktorSleepless,KingKRhule,We know he can harden yet he didn't which imo also adds credence to the theory
DoktorSleepless,justapotato9,Yepp he is not even trying even though he knows how badass levi is
AbaramaGolding,BigBad-Wolf,"They had no way of knowing about the titan serum, so they had no idea that someone had eaten Bert."
Shaponja,RabidEquus,There must have been some negotiation or discussion in the 4-year interim between S3 and S4. I guess Levi could be convinced to work together with Zeke if Zeke demonstrated he was willing to betray Marley and save Paradis from conquest.
Shaponja,Cole3003,"I think Eren or Armin would probably be the one to originally negotiate and Levi gets dragged into it, and if Zeke is on their side, I'd be willing to bet that his royal blood would be a very important detail for him switching sides and Paradais accepting it."
Shaponja,One_Eyed_Sneasel,"Normally I‚Äôd agree, but its not like they are making amends and letting zeke live happily ever after. He dies from the titan curse in less than a year so he‚Äôs a goner regardless."
ShaidarHaran2,ReggieEvansTheKing,I think he‚Äôs in it for himself and just riding the chaos until he can acquire the founding titan. Kinda like little finger was in got.
ShaidarHaran2,KingKRhule,I don't know if I really agree with that. Yeah he says the baseball pun stuff but I can't remember a specific incident of him relishing in killing
JooK8,espectro11,"You're mostly wrong, Kruger tells grisha that all of that was meant to happen ever since he passed through the gates with his sister. He said he knew he was gonna do that and if he didn't all the hotels of the last titan war would repeat. A bit later he says he needs to protect armin and mikasa and grisha asks who those are and he said he didn't know whose memories they were which means the attack titan can look into future titans memories too."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,"The look on warhammer when she understood that she was about to die, forced to see her brother being eaten and then herself being eaten.

Porco is such an idiot if he hadn't attacked Eren wouldn't have known how to eat Warhammer.

I loved how the tide of the battle changed, at first it seemed like Eren and co were gonna die then suddenly Armin drops a nuke and now they have almost captured 3 more shifters. Zeke might be dead already.

It was a good episode, had fun"
-mi_h_ir-,LordSprinkleman,"The Warhammer's last few minutes must have been complete hell. She was being lugged around like a piece of candy by the guy who had just eaten her brother and couldn't do a single thing to stop him. Then she has to watch his open maw underneath her as he uses one of her own to slowly grind down her crystal... not a good way to go.

Still rooting for Eren though, he knows exactly what he's doing and doesn't act like he has the moral high ground."
LordSprinkleman,vvvvfl,this sequence made me think...is Annie conscious....has she been conscious in the crystal pod the whole time?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daniel6392,Armin is looking hot as fuck!
Daniel6392,MBFlash,Literally! He makes everything close to him EVAPORATEü§£ü§£ü§£
Daniel6392,crimsonphoenix12,Didn't think Best Boy could get any better...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jbere75,"Damn what an episode. Low chance zeke is dead imo. I think eren finally puts reiner out of his misery next episode, but we shall see. So hype that unlike some other anime (cough cough hxh) this show is getting the final season it deserves."
jbere75,it_is_whatitiz,Don't believe they killed zeke. Wild guess something to do with royal blood. Also why would levi ever use a grenade. I think he will be taken captive.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daniel6392,How the hell did Hanji get that flying thing? The only thing that comes to me mind is that they either stole it from Marley or they allied with one of Marley‚Äôs enemies.
Daniel6392,OOM-32,"The black guy piloting it seems to be a double agent at first sight, considering how they speak. I assume they just stole it."
Daniel6392,anbsmxms,Definitely stole it. They have people undercover like jean and eren. They must have someone who learned how to operate it.
Daniel6392,CrispierCupid,"Eren saw one in his flashbacks, he could have given Hange the idea"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,9HashSlingingSlasher,The animation for the Titans and just in general looked better this episode. The characters faces looked better too.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,"I wanted to see Eren fight the Warhammer for a bit longer. It felt the Warhammer was just randomly swinging things around.

I noticed that Zeke said ""you don't have time"" to Levi. Doesn't this mean that Zeke knew the plan, I mean he knew that Levi only had a limited amount of time to kill him.

Him saying Eren is not my enemy is also pretty sus"
-mi_h_ir-,Darknfullofhype,"My head cannon is that the recent holders of the Warhammer titan don't use it often, so they're not nearly as proficient as the warriors or Eren. It makes sense she'd get her ass kicked.

Edit: typo"
Darknfullofhype,BigBad-Wolf,"It's kind of like Annie vs Eren. Annie was at her second transformation, so she was probably weaker than Eren, except he used up all of his stamina for a few cool-looking attacks that didn't really do anything."
-mi_h_ir-,uhohshesintrouble,That Levi and Beast ‚Äútime‚Äù thing confused me too. Why did Levi have limited time?
uhohshesintrouble,CF0311,Because he thought Marley was about to kill them all. In his mind the Eldians were done for.
-mi_h_ir-,Former_Sea,You don‚Äôt have time is not about that. It‚Äôs about the fuel they are running out of. Each time they use their equipment they loose more fuel and as long as they don‚Äôt progress then they are wasting fuel. The moment it‚Äôs finished there will be 3 titans and the army on them. Luckily that did not happen
-mi_h_ir-,mundotaku,Eren had a lot more experience fighting than the Warhammer girl. This means he knew how to make best use of his power.
Shreddies123,instantclassico,Not alot of war stories in general actually show the perspective from both sides like this. Drives home the tragedy and needlessness of war
Shreddies123,G00dAndPl3nty,"The perspective flip on season 4 annoyed me at first, but man oh man has it paid off. It was pure genius. Any other way wouldn't have been as impactful. We get to see the other side of the war, and its heartbreaking"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,what an absolutely INSANE episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OOM-32,"I'm so sorry for the collateral damage on this episode.

Like, they fucking nuke half the city with the civils still inside.

Yeah they killed the fleet but holy shit they could have done it further on the sea.

Also did all the water just evaporate?"
OOM-32,anbsmxms,Yes that what the colosal titan does. Heat comes out of it that why it creates nuke like effect. The hot steams kills all in the vicinity.
anbsmxms,OOM-32,"But it's the coast. One would think the sea would flow back in the crater, right?"
OOM-32,LaCipe,Also I feel the detonation was MUCH stronger than any colossal appearance so far in the series.
LaCipe,Xstew26,He looked chunkier than Bertolt too but that may be me just seeing things
LaCipe,Nobodyishearingthis,Is it something the colossal titans can control? Because in season 1 when berthorld tramsforms at the wall he doesn't just blow them up.
LaCipe,blubat26,IIRC B didn‚Äôt have it for very long at all before going to Paradis. Possible it‚Äôs stronger because Armin has been training to get the biggest and baddest boom for the last several years.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,danmathe123,Sasha and Jean = A team
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,"Holy shit what an amazing episode, the part at the end where Eren ripped off the jaw titans limbs and used his mouth the crush the pod was amazing, Also holy shit they animated the Colossal Titan. Also the Armoured titan looks different? whats up with that"
PM_ME_UR_NUDES_GURL_,civeng1741,Armored titan wasn't fully healed and kinda half assed his transformation probably. There's a lot of parts with no armor
civeng1741,lonewolf0406,And he looked so depressed.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Maame_lade,I noticed this last episode but forgot to comment. Anyone else notice how Jean is the one giving commands to the soldiers? I remember in season 1 how Marco said he would be a great leader but Jean himself was hesitant to take that role for fear of being responsible for the deaths of others. It's nice to see him confidently giving orders and stepping up.
Maame_lade,theonechan,Jean seems like a very capable 2nd in command type. May not be a grand strategist but able to retain composure in chaotic situations.
verticaluzi,Pardusco,It really looked like she knew shit was about to pop off.
Xstew26,JohnDorianSalinger,"Historia.

The proportions were unnatural and the face intentional obstructed because she's in disguise"
spellingcunts,Pardusco,"I don't think so. Their faces just look too different.

This soldier is one of the most intriguing characters to me right now lol"
spellingcunts,tigergeisha,"I've thought this from the beginning, for me it's Annie. I totally thought it was a woman impersonating a guy soldier and when Pieck felt something familiar I was immediately like ""oh shit Annie"".

I guess we'll see!"
teej,SHADOWSTRIKE1,Hey u/Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri can we get a ban on this Allan guy so he stops messaging people spoilers?
teej,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"What?  I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúget‚Äù you at all.  I specifically stated ‚ÄúAllan‚Äù as the guy the mod needs to look into.

I‚Äôm echoing your message about that ‚ÄúAllan_d10‚Äù person sending spoilers, and requesting that the moderator ban them so they can‚Äôt look up usernames to message.  I think it best to specifically let moderators know so they can take action rather than just mention it in a thread."

L1uQ,LaCipe,"In any normal anime I'd expect an unforeseen comeback, but at this point I can't predict at all what's going to happen."
Bring_Me_The_Night,Plague_Knight1,"I'm guessing the attack titan's special ability is enhanced strength, shown when Eren lifts the boulder in Trost, or when Kruger breaks a steel warship on his back. If any similar size shifter can do that, then the attack titan is just a 15m but angrier"
Bring_Me_The_Night,Glori94,"I just imagined that he spent the past 4 years pushing all abilities to the limit....just transforming as often as possible, assuming it's like a muscle and can be worked out and grown stronger/better."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SexyDuckDocumentary,"Awesome episode. Really thought we were going to see more action from Zeke. Didn't think he was gonna just splash around for a bit and get insta KO-d by levi.

Also couldn't Erin use his founding titan powers to change all the Marley titan's memories so they change sides? He would just need to bring a vial of Historia's blood to activate those powers right?"
SexyDuckDocumentary,OOM-32,"Yeah, like, omg hype for a rematch, them  after a couple scout casualties bim they are all down.

I honestly don't feel the tension now. Only reiner stands. Is he enough to take on the paradis forces?

Granted I'm not considering the marleyan army surrounding the city, but to be fair, like half of it must have gotten obliterated with the fleet."
OOM-32,SexyDuckDocumentary,Maybe we'll get to see more anti titan tech? Something like a fighter airplane should be able to inflict quite a bit of damage whilst staying out of the range of thunder spears.
OOM-32,MapTheJap,"I mean, after their first fight, in the middle of a field where ODM gear should be practically useless Levi decimated him, I don't see Zeke standing a better chance in an urban environment"
SexyDuckDocumentary,Dimmadeezy,"No, it has to be a royal blooded Titan. Historia isn‚Äôt a Titan, and the only time we‚Äôve seen Eren use it is when he touches Dina Fritz‚Äôs hand, so I‚Äôm not sure touching just their blood would work anyways."
Dimmadeezy,SexyDuckDocumentary,"That makes sense. So then Erin could still use Zeke's titan to activate those powers, right? Assuming the titan doesn't have to be still alive"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ashl9898,"Great episode, I just didn‚Äôt like how Eren took his sweet ass time when eating Jaw. There was no need to just smack him around for ages, just go straight for the nape? Also throughout it all when Pieck was injured on the ground, couldn‚Äôt he have just ran over and ate her too lmao?

I‚Äôm not picky, loved the episode. Just think it was a great opportunity to take 2 more of the enemies titans away"
Ashl9898,Glori94,"There's a bit of discussion about this elsewhere in the comments but I think it's a series of reasons.

He clearly had a major reaction upon eating the war titan. Whether he simply couldn't eat another, or just needed a moment, bashing Jaw gives him time to recover/prepare to do it again without giving him a window to heal. Same for Pieck. She's probably the lowest threat and can be dealt with after Jaw.

Lastly, when Reiner transformed, to just lazily copy another comment I made:
Also, I'd imagine that you can't really take that moment to eat Galliard. If a titan just transformed, and your weak spot is your neck, AND you've already transformed 3 times with a few hardenings....you can't really stand to ignore it especially if there's going to be a bit of a delay while you absorb everything from Galliard."
Ashl9898,MBFlash,Don't you mean pieky? piecky?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gumorak,Eren was making me mad at the end. Quit playing with your food and eat him! Come on man.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lordofthekebabs,"Why didnt Eren eat Galliard there,I know he distracted by Reiner but still he could have chewed him in a second"
lordofthekebabs,tunablepizza,plot armour
tunablepizza,Dio-Dio-Dio,"Only thing stronger than Titan Crystal
#Plot Armor"
lordofthekebabs,Combat_Wombat23,The look on Eren‚Äôs face and lack of movement immediately after he eats the War Hammer makes me think it takes more than an instant to absorb the other shifter.  Maybe inheriting such an old lineage in that titan takes a toll.
Combat_Wombat23,Glori94,"Don't you get all the memories of the person, too? On top of powers. It's probably overwhelming.

Also, I'd imagine that you can't really take that moment to eat Galliard. If a titan just transformed, and your weak spot is your neck, AND you've already transformed 3 times with a few hardenings....you can't really stand to ignore it especially if there's going to be a bit of a delay while you absorb everything from Galliard."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rzslm,"I noticed that Mikasa cutting of Jaw‚Äôs legs after he rushed in too recklessly was similar to when a titan ate Eren‚Äôs legs when he was charging. Also, I feel like Reiner is what Erwin would become if they let him live. It‚Äôs especially heartbreaking to see them forcing someone who shouldn‚Äôt even be alive to milk all the usefulness they can out of him."
rzslm,megasean3000,S4E7 was for Marley as S1E5 was for Paradis. Watching their friends and loved ones getting picked off one after the other by a clearly superior threat. Watching the Colossal Titan return in the most unexpected of ways. And of course: knocking the blockhead down a few pegs.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AbaramaGolding,Zeke is defs not dead.  Wonder how they're going to twist this one
AbaramaGolding,MASISCH,"I have a theory that Zeke's been playing the long LONG game somehow, and is working with Paradis now"
MASISCH,kunallanuk,"My theory is that Zeke's been playing the long game and isn't pro paradis or pro marley, he's just trying to amass power via the founding titan and go rogue/shape his own world

I doubt he's pro paradis because of how brutal he was in Paradis, not just killing innocents but transforming Conny's family's village etc"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YvonMatterhorn,"how is the Warhammer titan be able to observe her surroundings while in her cocoon but the female titan fells into a coma for infinite time? and would the female titan just straight up die after 13 years passes or is time frozen for her?

nevertheless, I guess her bet is that when the time comes and paradise falls, the jaw titan would just crack her up. so she definitely knew the jaw titan was capable of that."
YvonMatterhorn,Shaponja,"I doubt that the Jaw Titan is literally the only thing that can open the crystal. Feels too circumstantial. They might be able to exit it themselves, but in both cases (Annie and Lara) it was better to stay inside for protection? Maybe Annie isn‚Äôt in a coma? I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs established."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ashl9898,"Also I don‚Äôt understand, how come Armins Colossal Titan completely destroyed everything in the vicinity but Bertolts at Shiganshina only left two footprints?"
Ashl9898,TrungTH,It's the shifter choice to use the nuke power or just simply transform.
TrungTH,crimsonphoenix12,"This makes the most sense, especially because Bertholdt did use his nuke abilities last season in Shiganshina."
Ashl9898,anbsmxms,Bertolt do not have water. The steam is whats causing damage.
anbsmxms,Ashl9898,"Makes sense, thanks"
Ashl9898,nefreu,Remember the walls in Paradis are made with the hardened material of colossal titans.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FeelDeAssTyson,LOL MARLEY GET FUCKED! Imagine blowing a 5 titan lead.
as122000,Darknfullofhype,"It's because at this point it's become a burden and sense of duty rather than a revenge fantasy. If he doesn't step up to the plate and let go of his humanity, Paradis can't win. He knows what has to be done, and that it includes many civilian casualties."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"so many twist and turns, i loved this episode. too much to process. a few fav moments:

&#x200B;

\- the constant reversals of 'Team Marley' having advantage - quickly followed by the scouts reversing was amazing

\- I say it every week, but I am so glad we got to know these new characters before we saw this stuff, it matters SO much more when they are at odds.

\- Loved the coordination of the scouts. Levi using the opening to take out the Beast was surreal. I will be irritated Zeke he survives this.. but I feel like he will because we may have more to learn from him? As in a final confrontation with Eren?

\- Eren using the Jaw titan as a 'tool' was both one of the most badass and simultaneously terrifying moments of the show for me.

\- I was hopeful that Reiner was going to drift off peacefully, but of course he can't.. I think we are finally getting ready to say goodbye to his character after some great development.

\- the music was really great this episode

Hdplvemealone,Bring_Me_The_Night,"To be honest, I really didn't like Porco after episode 2 (and what he said about Ymir). Now, I don't feel the character has so much antipathy and vanity, only naivete. I feel a bit sad for him."

I LOST MY SHIT WHEN I SAW ARMIN

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,celestialpaperclip,"Man what stuck with me the most was just watching the Survey Corp members go splat middair from Pieck‚Äôs crew, absolutely brutal"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joondori21,"Seriously tho people who are saying shit like ""you are asking the right questions"", ""definitely, that's gonna happen"", ""just read the manga *hint* *hint*"" should all fuck themselves.

I clicked on this shit cause it said ""ANIME ONLY"" but I should've known there's gonna be plenty of dumbasses that's gonna be trolling. I now have a pretty good inclination on what's gonna happen cause of the repeated ""hints"". This is why we can't have nice things. Fuck all of you ""predictors"", you aren't sounding smart, just annoying as hell.

Btw, if you are reading this and haven't come across those comments, I really would recommend you to get tf out of this thread for your enjoyment.

TLDR: Even though this is ""ANIME ONLY"" thread there's plenty of people not explicitly spoling but giving hints which basically does the same thing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,"Eren's VA is really nailing the 'dead inside' vibe huh. 

I love it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zackywacky123321,"My mouth... WAS OPENED THE WHOLE TIME.  I HAD TO SIT UP INSTEAD OF LAY DOWN!!!.  First of all, the colossal titan scene was amazingly brilliant, I almost cried.  Second of all, POOR PIECKE.  Third of all, I literally loved the war hammer titan, that blood literally shattered my soul.  Fourth of all, I‚Äôm so sad that piecks friends had pictures in the carts gear, truly heartbreaking.  And now armin has a huge kill count.  There‚Äôs just so much going on, truly a beautiful anime!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uhohshesintrouble,"Bruh...my takings from that episode:

\- I can't believe Eren is now the Attack, Founding and Warhammer titan...that can't be good for his body lmao. Someone needs to eat the Jaw Titan ASAP so they can eat Annie and become the Female Titan.

\- YAY, another Black character!

\- Very confused about the 'timing' thing with Zeke and Levi...what was that about?

\- Something is deffo up with Zeke, no way he is dead.

\- Did anyone watch the preview for next episdoe? >!Seeing the corps run up on Eren like that has me thinking that Eren is really straying from team Paradis.!<

\- This is seriously going to be a season that divides viewers...Survey Corps are becoming real brutal...perhaps deservedly...idk."
uhohshesintrouble,PyroJack24,Feels as though Eren is acting separately from the scouts and the scouts just have no choice but to follow him to safeguard the founder or something.
PyroJack24,uhohshesintrouble,"Yup. I‚Äôd agree. Doesn‚Äôt seem like all of them are 100% for the plan. But did you see when they walked up on him, guns blazing? Weird."
uhohshesintrouble,massi1008,"> - YAY, another Black character!

Woah, now that you mention it. This guy is kinda special, he had a weird name, Marley uniform and knows how to fly an airship. I don't think he was kidnapped, he seemed really ok with doing that. (Also HELL YEAH Hanji is back <3).

This guy and the asian woman talking to Willy before his show makes me think that there are other parties - or nations - that are aiding Paradis is fighting the Marlyans."
massi1008,cjboyonfire,Agreed. The Asian women who Udo bumped in to said she‚Äôs didn‚Äôt think eldians are that bad. I assume other nations will be choosing their alliances soon
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iasoninho,I was in awe .The introduction of Armin left me speechless.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,notarsalaanahsan,Really thought Monke titan vs Levi would be slightly more exciting this time around. Man just ended him in half the time he took last time. Poor Zeke.
notarsalaanahsan,as122000,I feel like hes not dead yet and they‚Äôll fight again properly in the near future
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ze-Bruh,"I love this anime; it really nails the humanization of both sides, pretty much as well as ATLA. I legit felt bad seeing the panzer unit die, or the fact that Eren felt like a power hungry bastard and that Armin is pretty much Bertholdt at this point. Izayama isn't afraid to switch roles and that's why I think this series is so attractive."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,anbsmxms,I dont know who to root for now. The paradis team specially eren looks brutal. The soundtracks seems to root for Reiner. I am amazed that I am feeling torn after only knowing the Marley titans for only a few episodes.
anbsmxms,OOM-32,"I... I amm not exactly rooting for Marley at this point, but I feel attached to them.

I guess it's the underdog complex.

Also for nuking a city in cold blood.

They probably already have doubled the kill count in shinganshima alone by now."
OOM-32,PyroJack24,You might forget that many more died after Shinganshina due to famine and all those stuff brought on be the loss of the 1st wall which had much of the food supply for Paradis.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-ShaiHulud-,Eren over here collecting titans like they're Pok√©mon.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LucHendriks2003,Armin really does not like what is happening
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thatsmyshore,Reiner looking like handsome squidward at the end
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shaponja,"If the body is not shown, they aren‚Äôt dead. Zeke is pretty suspicious. Some think that he is helping the Paradis people - I think it might be true, but how would that work, since he murdered Erwin and like 200 scouts while playing baseball.. 

I hoped we could finally get Attack Titan vs Beast Titan, but nevermind lol. If that happens Eren could use the Founding Titan power

Who the hell could the guy from the zeppelin be though. Pretty sure he isn‚Äôt from Paradis, but he seems loyal to them. Also he has a different uniform than the rest

It‚Äôs nitpicky but Mikasa looks really good, last episode she had a few odd-looking shots, I‚Äôm glad that wasn‚Äôt her actual look

It‚Äôs so cool how Eren can now transform instantly after leaving the titan body. Stamina 100. 

Damn Eren really took all of Porcos limbs and forced him to break the crystal! All while having that scary open-mouth face. That was so badass

Can‚Äôt wait to see how the Warhammer power will be used. Porco might get some of it too since he kinda had her body in his mouth. Idk.

WHY DIDNT HE FINISH HIS BITE ON PORCO HE COULDVE HAD THE JAW TITAN BEFORE REINER TRANSFORMED.

Still not a fan of the CGI but it‚Äôs definitely better than the last episode. Hoping it gets even better

Also the first sentence from the ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù seems like a big spoiler wtf."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Alexandre_Man,Best episode yet.
Alexandre_Man,MASISCH,"hands down yes. I've seen rumors that the best is still yet to come, so I'm mad hype to see what's next"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,remmon22,"Holy shit, that was diabolical! Everything is awesome. Though Zeke got defeated pretty easily but he didn't have screen time unlike Pieck who were seen as bloody or almost dead. Now I'm starting to think that those theories that Zeke has some kind of part into this seems feasible.

That Armin scene was spectacular, but he regret it afterwards due to the damage he caused, I wonder if he'd seen what Eren has seen, he'll be cold blooded killer too. At least it's confirmed that the soldier who trapped Pieck and Porcko is not Armin.

Poor Porcko, being used as a nutcracker, but damn I thought Eren got him good and then he made this awesome reversal move and he almost got Eren instead. And it seems Eren is expecting some kind of an upgrade later on, can't wait what's attack titan gonna be look like next time he transform.

Now I'm confused who actually planned this whole thing, probably Armin made a plan base on Eren's plan lol guess we'll find out another time.  And also, it appears that they have ally in the Marleyan army to acquire that blimp, how the heck did that happen, can't wait to find out. Lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kuhlayre,"I adore how this show displays the grey area. So often in these shows you have 'good guys' and 'bad guys'.
AOT definitely played to that trope for season 1-3 and then bam. In comes season 4.

It really shows that the good guys being good and the bad guys being bad is completely dependent on where you're standing.

I adore Sasha with my heart and soul, but to Gabi she's the devil incarnate. Armin is wonderful. A hero on multiple occasions. But to the people in the rubble he's a monster. His line about Berthold really enforced that. 
Speaking of Berthold, he was the reason Eren's mother was eaten but to his people he was a hero doing what was right. 
Gabi and Falco are precisely where Eren, Armin and Mikasa were at the beginning. Having their lives blown apart (figuratively and literally) by these evil creatures.

I just love the way the narrative unfolds so darn much. I feel bad for everyone equally and understand everyone's point of view. That so rarely happens and it's being done so well!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KnightBoi42,So that's why they call him nutcracker huh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,that1tallguy,Holy shit I was stressed that whole episode. I wonder if Reiner is actually going to fight Eren or the twist being he ‚Äúfights‚Äù him so he can finally die. Or will Eren be able to use war hammer?? Jesus that was amazing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bloody_sane,"Am i the Only one who likes Gabi's suffering.. that biatch had the audacity yo get mad when she happily killed countless people in the first episode. Suddenly when her soldier friends died she's acting mad. Okay she can be mad but dont act like it came outta no where.. she was training to GO KILL PARADISE DEVILS and when the table turns.. acting like she and her aide is only one that suffers.
And i don't see the parallel in her and Eren except for anger. she is being trained to be a killing machine.. while eren was being beaten up by bullies and suddenly his mom is dead..  with no knowledge of how and why.. but Gabi knows exactly how and why paradise devils are doing what was due to these Marley dogs"
bloody_sane,Saiyan_Deity,"Took the words out of my mouth. In the last episode she says something along the lines of ""I need to know why Udo and Sophia had to die."" Um, because y'all just declared war on them, cheered it on, and planned for their extinction for years.

And I get her situation, she's brainwashed and oppressed, but so are the other warriors, but they are way more likable. Annie at Gabbi's age knew it was all bullshit, Falco questions the whole thing, and the rest of the warriors have an attitude that comes off as ""I know this is kinda bullshit, but I'm just trying to give me and my family a better life"" which is reasonable, given their situation. Gabbi on the other hand seems to genuinely enjoy murdering other human beings and almost seems like she's in it for personal glory. 

I hate that she's compared to Eren so much. Aside from being an ambitious hot head, that's pretty much where the similarities end."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LuiTurbo,Reiner vs Eren III next episode. Will Eren be able to use the warhammars powers instantly?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,borfyborf,I thought the cgi actually looked really good this episode. I never cared too much about the cgi but I really think MAPPA is finding their footing. Last episode the cgi definitely stood out a lot but it looks much better this episode in my opinion.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Burtonpoelives,I‚Äôve been telling my husband Reiner is like a father or mother and this episode proved my point. He sees his life as useless but those kids cried for him and he got up. They tore the Marley up

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,McAbby12,I was literally saying ‚ÄúOh shit‚Äù under my breath every few seconds.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the_little_engineer,"Did anybody else noticed the parallels between Porco losing this episode and Eren's first titan fight in season 1? Overcome with emotion, Porco charges at the enemy and while jumping from rooftop to rooftop he gets his legs cut off by an enemy underneath him and  lands right at another titan ready to defeat him. Just like Eren in season 1 getting his leg bit off by a titan as he's crossing over a gap between rooftops. Just incredible story telling."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,switowski101,I understand that the main message of the series is that all of this is wrong and we‚Äôre supposed to be upset at both sides but I‚Äôm still rooting like hell for Paridis to beat Marley.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shreddies123,"Just thought of something. If they break Annie out of her crystal (why it looks like the explosives can do) could historia then eat her? And then when she is in Titan form, Eren could touch her and use the founding Titan's powers? All they would need is some syrum which presumably they would have been able to steal from Marley by now."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,"I think killing Willy was right in retrospect, he was key in making other countries unite and fight against Paradis.

All the other countries may fight Paradis even now but they would never come together with Marley government. They may even withdraw seeing the damage Paradis can do cuz they did withdraw when they were devastated by Marley Titans.

I don't think anyone would want to go up against the collosal Titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,luke-ms,Am I missing something? How does Porco recognize the Ackermans just by looking at them?
luke-ms,Kbains01,Since he ate Ymir he has her memories. Also Reiner and Zeke could‚Äôve filled him in on stuff relating to the Eldians.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LucHendriks2003,REINER REINER REINER well annoying kids make him look badass lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nenkha29,"Oh my god, it just dawned on me... i‚Äòm anime only, but this has to be it. After learning from /u/antrix_AFC that Eren had a baseball and a glove, matching Zekes hobby, this is my conclusion.

Zekes scene with Levi was so weird. He has to be the conspirator behind this attack. They just had to make it seem like Levi killed Zeke, so he can escape with the guys from Paradis.

The Owl probably told Zeke as a child what his role was. He had to turn in his parents, so Grisha would get taken to Paradis. Grisha then inherites the Attack Titan, gives it to Eren who‚Äòs mission is to free all Eldians from the oppression of Marley? On the other hand... Eren did kill many of them. Idk but

Zeke said in episode 2 of this season to Colt, who‚Äòd inherit the Beast titan after him, that Colt would get behind his secret as soon as he‚Äòs the beast titan... yeah, Zeke afterwards said his secret how he wipes his ass, but he probably had his life as a double agent in mind.

It reminds me of Itachis burden. Although Zeke probably hasn‚Äòt that kind of bond with any person from Marley.

I‚Äòm so fucking hyped rn"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NoodlesForeverAlways,"Did anybody else rewatch the episode after a recuperation break to fully absorb every detail? Here‚Äôs what I picked up on my second watch:

The cute photos that the Panzer Unit had of Pieck and the team in their little section on the Cart Titan‚Äôs armour. Little nigh inconspicuous Details like that really hammer in the loss of humanity. 

When Falco was trying to save Pi√´ck she told him to leave her and save herself. It‚Äôs kind of funny and ironic how arguably the most kind hearted and (IMO) the prettiest and most genteel warrior has the creepiest looking Titan. 

The general looks of relief and admiration the soldiers had when they saw the Beast Titan enter the battlefield. Despite being Eldian, the warriors (especially Zeke) actually commanded a fair amount of respect from the Marleyan military. 

I‚Äôm drawing a lot of parallels between Pieck and Armin. In terms of tactical planning and leadership skills. 

Was anybody else a little disappointed by the Warhammer Titan? I was incredibly disappointed initially but then after some thought I realised she probably didn‚Äôt get much training done due to the secrecy of the Warhammer Titan."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SovacoDaCobra,"I‚Äôd just like to say that I appreciate Magath as a character. At the beginning of the season I just figured he was the head asshole Marleyan who didn‚Äôt give to shits about Eldians. Over the last few episodes you slowly get the sense that he does see them as people even though it‚Äôs his duty to use them as weapons in war. Then this episode you get to see him interact with Falco and Gabi while everything is happening and we see that he really does care about these kids. I just think it‚Äôs interesting to see someone who would normally just be an adversarial side character actually be fleshed out and made somewhat likable.

Also, he has a badass name."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jheeeeeezzzzz,I kinda feel bad for the warriors tbh i don‚Äôt feel that connected but the acting is so good i feel sorry when jaw titan got used like that
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chronoboy1985,"Out of all the Marley Titan‚Äôs if Pieck gets eaten, that‚Äôs gonna hurt the most, personally. Not just because she‚Äôs a woman, but because she always seems soft-spoken, sweet, and motherly outside of battle. While everyone else is gung-ho genocidal. 

Reiner‚Äôs a close 2nd, but I kind of just want him to be put out of his misery. The poor guy is a wreck and his brain must be twisting in knots trying to come to grips with everything he‚Äôs done and that‚Äôs happening now. PTSD, Survivor‚Äôs guilt, Schizophrenia all rolled-in to one swole boy."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mc-tarheel,"It is so fascinating to me how the gentle folks seem to get the Colossal. Like, Berthold was the ""sweet heart"" of the warrior group, much the softest of them. Armin is kiiiinda the same. Not saying Armin can't be hard, but remember that Armin was the one who didn't fight back, who went for smarts over brutality multiple times.

Pieck... aw, man. Poor chick. Everyone died on her back and then she was incinerated. We saw this happen to Reiner in S3. Shit huuuuuuuurts."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ionlad,"Well, that was on a whole new level. From seeing the blood and gore inflicted on Eren and his friends in the beginning, you do kinda salut Eren to fuck them all up as gruesome as it is; in a 'fuck yeah!' kind of way."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,natedigsturdikat,My favorite episode of the season and one of the best of the whole show
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NorthernSpectre,"IMO Attack on Titan is by far the best anime right now, and I'd easily place it top 3 in terms of all shows, not just anime. I'm actually having a hard time thinking of a show that has me more hyped than this shit. God damn it's so beautifully brutal.

Also, I guess we figured out how all those ships dissapeared."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ApacheFYC,no ones mentioned how the armored titans face looks like a normal face now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,QuantuMope,"Oh my fucking god. Every single character delivered this episode.

Eren being able to transform 1927398 times without pause cause he's a boss. (idgaf if it's plot armor, we earned it)

Mikasa doing Mikasa things slicing up the Jaw titan for Eren.

Levi almost anticlimactically wrecking the Beast titan, god damn. Effectively, avenging Erwin.

Jean getting his own revenge for his mistake letting the Cart titan rescue Reiner 4 years back.

Sasha bein a human aimbot and throwin off the Panzer unit's groove.

Armin taking out the whole navy in one shot (even though he was sad about it lol)

And then finally Hange showing up like a boss lookin like a pirate. I'm not recalling if Connie did anything special this episode but I definitely could have missed it cuz the adrenaline was blinding my eyeballs. I'm going to rewatch the episode a couple dozen times to check."
QuantuMope,drank_your_water,Mikasa serving dinner for Eren was badass
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shazam635,"That episode was amazing, what shook me is that it‚Äôs soo brutal again it reminds me of the first season. Eren is way too far gone, he is actually a threat to society. Like he was straight brutal eating the war hammer using porko. Damn. Even the cgi was amazing ur on the edge of ur seat all the time, I just find it funny riener got suicidal thoughts maybe that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs be loosing soo much he just wanna die. 

That episode was golden absolutely golden, if ur opinion is other than that then I pity u"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,Reiner's titan looks so different! also I wonder if eren's ability to transform multiple times is one of the attack titan special powers or it's something any titan shifter can learn through practice.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Styler852,"This episode was really good. The only thing i missed was the ""old"" titan thunder transformation sound when armin transformed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BleedingEdge61104,Titans refuse to die man. Eren could have eaten the Jaw easily but that was inconvenient for the plot.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AReallyCuriousBarbie,BDSSHSHSSHSHSJSJDDAJ IT WAS SO GOOD AND INTENSE AND UGHHH WTF
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Positive_Magician_52,HOLYSHIT!! Paradis is just overpowered now??? That it?? They just laid it on Marley like NOBODY's business. This is like the despair arc like Trost but with Marley on the receiving end god damn they got destroyed.
Positive_Magician_52,Clumulus,They were absolutely trashing the Marley forces omg.
Positive_Magician_52,justaverage00,Marley is pretty much screwed at this point with they're hopes resting on a depressed and suicidal Reiner
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ArkhamKnight1954,#FAZE SASHA
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sassyaspho,"Can we please talk more about how BADASS Jean and Sasha were in this episode!! The adrenaline rush when Jean took out the Cart and Sasha with that deadass aim!

And Armin! Let‚Äôs just say he got out of the friend zone and went 0-100 real quick! But on a serious note, I feel so bad for him. The pain that he must feel with how much destruction his Colossal can do. He‚Äôs so kind hearted that I‚Äôm sure all of this will weigh on him. It definitely makes you feel bad for the innocent victims in Marley. But the same goes for all the innocent in Paradis when Marley attacked too. That‚Äôs the thing about war, everyone gets hurt regardless of what side they‚Äôre on. 

I can‚Äôt wait to see more Hange!

Levi and Zeke seemed suspiciously short lived. I think there‚Äôs more to Zeke than meets the eye. I‚Äôm really starting to think he‚Äôs another Owl. I started to question his role when he wasn‚Äôt escorted to the pit with Porco and Pieck. 

(Side note: it‚Äôs basically confirmed that soldier that trapped them in the pit wasn‚Äôt Armin too since he was in the boat. So that was definitely someone else undercover 100%)

And Eren is a damn savage!! It was so badass how he would just pop out and transform again whenever his Titan was done. Definitely shows how much he has been mastering his control. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was a crazy move using Porco as a Titan nutcracker and I was hyped watching it! But at the same time it felt so inhuman and monster-like to use the Jaw that way to crush the Warhammer. I think its showing how far Eren is willing to go (and probably then some) to do what he feels is just. I kinda wish he would have just taken the Jaw too while he had him but I can‚Äôt wait to see how he will use his new Warhammer powers in the next episode!

I also hope poor Reiner gets put out of his misery soon. I feel so bad for the guy!

Lastly, the next episodes title scares me..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YamFor,Is no one talking about Erens stamina? He‚Äôs become a titan like 3 times in this fight
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,honneypot,"My thoughts on this episode:

\-So much has probably happened to them during this time skip

\-Sasha and Armin look so different like the life was sucked out of them, Sasha looks so much more mature 

\-Jean seems to be the same but matured as well, when he hesitated shooting Pieck because of Falco, that reminded me of when he hesitated shooting that person as Eren was being kidnapped and Armin saved him. Pieck now got to live because he hesitated

\-It was so sad seeing Pieck's squad get shot, it's not often you get to see both sides of a war 

\-Zeke was defo acting super suspicious in this episode, "" we are running out of time Levi"" ... and Levi with the clock, mans just stood there and let himself get shot down easily by Levi... very suspicious indeed..

\-Porco was seriously underestimating the scouts... it is crazy how Marley easily won the war against that nation using the power of the titans. But, for Paradis, the only enemy they fought is Titans, all their life,  that's all they've known. So, it isn't surprising to see that they are so advanced fighting titans compared to Marley 

\-a lot of people commented on the soundtrack and how it was ""lacking"" but I personally found it fine, it was fitting and appropriate. The anime is a completely different vibe from the first 3 seasons so the soundtrack is not going to be the same."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joondori21,"ITT: people who obviously knows what happens and hinting and ""predicting"". Get out now if you don't wanna be spoiled."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShaidarHaran2,"-Eren is scary   
-Is it me or did Reiner's titan look like sexy squidward?  

-Ooh, so this was Armin's plan, and they've recruited...A black guy? They can't have built that blimp with maybe 3 years of spying, so I assume others are helping them?  

-Gonna be honest, and I shouldn't have to put a page of disclaimer text around this not to get attacked or downvoted into oblivion, but the animation with the Ackermans flying around Monke wasn't that strong, compare that to Levi v Monke last season. It is what it is, not faulting Mappa for a tight schedule. Great episode, no hate, but...I hate that I feel like I have to explain that each time! 
 
-That seemed...Way too easy for Levi vs Monke. Can't be all surely."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daisy_no,"Does anyone else feel incredibly bad for Pieck and her crew? The cart Titans gang is tight and in sync, she heard them all die on her."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dracob2099,"I can't imagine how I fucking despise Gabi, so damn annoying..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jznaveed,"I know a lot of people dislike the cgi but I feel that it makes tge Titans so much more intimidating, especially the Attack Titan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ditchedyouonce,"Eren was CRAZY. Mans used Gilliard to eat War Hammer titan. Lmao that's some next level psychopath shit. Anywho, during all this I think what we fail to realize is, Eren and everyone from paradis island did this out of necessity but people of Marley killed thousands of Eldians out of greed and pure hatered. I'll support Eren through and through. Marley wanted a war, they were ready for a war but when they sent female, jaw, armoured and colossal titan to paradis island to get the founding titan people weren't ready, they didn't even know what was going on, they were at a disadvantage. Marleyans keep calling Eldians from paradis island demons but they fail to see that THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MADE THEM THE WAY THEY ARE. They turned thousands and thousands of Eldians into a titan and send them to paradis island. Eldians from within the walls were forced to be that way. I don't think I'll ever feel remorse for Marleyans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrFaceButNotHerDads,"Did anyone notice the parallels between Porco's titan rushing into battle only to get his legs sliced by Mikasa compared to Eren in the first season rushing into battle only to get his leg chomped by a titan? It draws attention to the theme Isayama has been reinforcing time and time again that mere determination isn't going to trump strategy and tactics in war. It's even more satisfying this time around since Mikasa catches Porco in titan form by surprise, highlighting the fact that just like Titans were a terrifying beast in the first few seasons, now it's the Paradis Eldians who are picking apart the Marleyans with the same ease. 

Other parallels to draw between these two scenes is how they pay an uncomfortable amount of attention to Armin and Eren slipping inside the titan's mouth in S1 and Lara Tybur's remains falling into Eren's mouth in this most recent episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wolfgangdodge,"What a badass episode. So good. It felt like 5 minutes though y u‚Äôre doing this to us

Some thoughts

1. Eren - Porco - Lara scene was just brutal and satisfying at the same time. Am I wrong to think this way? But I just don‚Äôt love the scene, I love how Eren grew from being crybaby to a full-grown titan. He‚Äôs well-trained now, and he‚Äôs come prepared.
2. Armin‚Äôs eyes when he saw the massive count of dead bodies on his weight. They‚Äôre full of regret. Armin is still our old Armin but more badass.
3. Sasha‚Äôs scenes are always short but they‚Äôre always FIRE. Such a long-range shooter!
4. I believe in Ackerman Supremacy only. Levi and Mikasa. Oh man. No words.
5. Zeke. I gotta tell you there‚Äôs more going on with Zeke, Levi, Paradis Island. His ‚Äúdeath‚Äù was shown too quickly I‚Äôm not sure he was killed or he just disappeared. Looks to me as if he‚Äôs having an escape plan with Levi. I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just me but let‚Äôs find out. 
6. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt die. Survive til the end.‚Äù My sweet Levi.
7. The whole scout I am so happy they‚Äôve grown, they‚Äôre well-equipped, they know what they‚Äôre doing. Rooting for them always.

This whole episode is just badass I keep on repeating that but it is, no doubt. More content next week"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,warsavage32,"Anyone else think something is really off about Zeke? I‚Äôve had my suspicions since the second episode where he makes the subtle ‚Äúnot here‚Äù comment about the top brass being at that meeting of the warriors he called. Then my suspicion was peaked in the episode when that Marley soldier that sure seems to be an undercover Eldian from Paradis conveniently sent Zeke away before trapping the jaw and cart. But this week has made me sure something is up when Zeke shows up and calls out Levi only to be beaten far too easily, almost like it was planned? Idk but I think Zeke is betraying Marley somehow."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jazz-guy,"A typical day in Levi's life: waking up, yoga stretching, slapping some beast titan, getting some coffee (no sugar)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Barksie,Eren used Porco's jaw from his titan to kill Lara. What if Porco actually had some energy left and just swallowed Lara himself when Eren smashed the jaw together? That might have been a whoopsie lol
Barksie,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,I mean if Eren had even the slightest sense of urgency he could have just ate Porco real quick too.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OopsRedditItAgain,An Armoured Colossal would be something to behold#FeedArminSomeTitansToo

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cloudsinthasky,EREN ‚ÄúCATCH THEM ALL‚Äù YEAGER LMAOOO
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeepFizzle24,Lot of people talking about picking sides but I'm fully on Eren 's maniac side. I mean he saw his mom get eaten by titan because the assholes in Marley wanted the founding titan and resources from paradise. That's reason enough for me. Marley is not humane why should paradis be
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarkLordKnight5,Gabi is actually getting annoying nowüò≠ somebody has to put a bullet in her head asap
DarkLordKnight5,justaverage00,"well with the next episode being called ""assassin's bullet"" and the preview of the next episode showing her with the gun, I think she's gonna be putting the bullet in someone's head"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OkCryptographer8861,CAN WE TALK ABOUT ARMIN PLEASEEE I‚ÄôM IN LOVE WITH HIM
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EliPick,Levi is COLD BLOODED
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,beady11,Fantastic shortest 24 mins ever
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mama_lu0831,"Poor Reiner needs to just be put out of his misery. Porco should‚Äôve listened to Pieck and not been so reckless. Gabi needs an ativan, Falco needs at least 5. 
Thrilling to see Eren not be such a whine-bag and actually do something for once lol

This whole arc has been killer getting to watch animated, can‚Äôt wait for next week."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AsrielGoddard,"After the epic fanservice (the good kind) festival we had last week, this episode felt like a fcking horror movie.   
Ymir damn do I love this show."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NoodlesForeverAlways,I genuinely found it difficult to breathe throughout the entirety of this episode. My friends and I did a recorded watch party and we looked back on snippets of our facial expressions and for the majority of this episode we had our jaws gaping. Some of us were screaming: THE MAD MAN HAS DONE IT when Eren finally ate the Warhammer Titan. It was carnage
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hairab,"One thing I haven't seen discussed much is around the 12:45 mark, when Sasha shoots Carlo between the eyes, we see two photos in his gunner box. One with the Cart titan gang, and one of Pieck solo. This dude was crushing on Pieck. The other shooters also have photos in their gunner boxes. Its been like what, 7 episodes this season, that we've been introduced to the citizens and soldiers of Marley? MAPPA has done an amazing job bringing these characters to life. I went back to rewatch and when I saw Carlo's photos hanging, it again hit me that these are just people doing what they think is considered right. God damnit this show is fucking me up every Sunday. The week in between episodes is enough to get my fill of endorphins ready to be used by the time the next episode comes out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlueIvyBarter,"Eren was on X games mode. He‚Äôs fully tapped in and I LOVE it!! Zeke has also switched sides I‚Äôm assuming. Eren had a baseball earlier this season. Who loves baseball?? And throwing the rocks at everyone BUT the huge titan in his pathway? Also ‚ÄúLevi you‚Äôre running out of time‚Äù and then a convenient explosion with no body? Yeah, I still don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù but I have concluded that Zeke is now siding with Paradis for the time being. Maybe he was faking it since childhood? Or maybe a change of heart? A sudden realization? Who knows! Next week should be interesting. 

Also for anyone using Twitter, stay off of there until the manga ends or mute the names of characters as well as any variation of the show title ‚Äúaot‚Äù ‚Äúattackontitan‚Äù ‚Äúattack on titan‚Äù etc. Even if you don‚Äôt go out of your way to search something, Twitter‚Äôs ‚ÄúTopics to Follow‚Äù advert will automatically put tweets on your feed related to whatever you have tweeted about/searched in the past. I unfortunately saw a very heartbreaking spoiler :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Book_Of_Cain,"This show is just a masterpiece. That‚Äôs all I have to say. The characters are so complex, they all have dreams, regrets, loved ones, and people they would die for on both sides. I don‚Äôt want anyone to die. We only spent 5 or so episodes with Peick and I was damn near having a panic attack when she was getting attack, then I almost had another one when I thought she was going to kill Jean or Sasha. Hell I even felt bad for the no named people in Pieck‚Äôs Machine gun suit when they were freaking out that their friend got shot in the head. There are no ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù guys at this point, only survival."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JerryEarthC137,"I especially liked the similarities and symmetries between the events of Shiganshina and Liberio.  

* The Colossal Titan - used to be a symbol of fear, now it's a symbol of hope
* Eren's mother crushed under the rabble and Eren's reaction, compared to Zofia's death and Gabi's reaction, and the overall similarities between Gabi and Eren, the two ""fucked up kids"" on both sides (""I'm gonna kill them all no matter what"") 
* Eren and Mikasa turning to Hannes for help - but he lacks the power fight titans.  
Gabi and Falco turning to Reiner for help - but he lacks the will to fight Eren... (Until eventually he does)
* Even when the Cart is attacked - I'm hearing ""Carlo... Noooo..."" and I can't help but think about Marco (it might be a stretch, but who knows? Maybe it's intentional?) 

The more I look into it, the more I understand how much of a masterpiece this series REALLY IS. I'm not even sure who I'm rooting for anymore, I have to say I think Reiner's faith is even more tragic than Eren's. 

The HYPE is REAL."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Iqlas,I feel that eren will be set up to be similiar to lelouch. Doing crazy evil stuff so that the world can be at peace in the end. Maybe mikasa or levi are force to kill him in the end
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Santurso,"Reading the thread i see alot of comments that seem to really enjoy the warriors getting destroyed!

I kind of feel sorry for all of them in this awful cicle of destruction and seeing Eren this raw really makes me sad ahah,

The fight scenes are amazing  tough!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jazz-guy,"One of the things that amaze me the most from this season is that we see those resourceless, primitive flying fools from Paradis become some kind of high-tech ghost ninja-like killing machines, all due to sheer training and survival needs. And we know they made it to this point leaving behind piles and piles of dead comrades.

Also, what does Marley expect? They kept throwing titans at Paradis and now are surprised that they are titan-killing experts."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,madscientistisme,"It was shocking to see Hanji and team arrive in a plane. I was wondering how they planned it all, how they contacted other countries, how they sought their help etc.  

But, at this point, looking at how the Paradis forces have an upper hand in the battle against Marley which has plenty of war experience fighting rival countries and having a lot of titans, nothing seems impossible for them. I really hope they win this war.

But, I am much more afraid of Gabi than Zeke, because Gabi is such a strong character and she sure reminds me of younger Eren. I hate her, because I can understand her point of view but I also equally understand the wrath faced by Paradis people from Marley. 

This war isn't between good or bad. It's between grey vs evil and made me realize big picture is what counts rather than Eren's or Gabi's POV."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TooRaized,Like Mikasa told eren it‚Äôs a cruel world and like Armin said in order to overcome monsters you must become one when he was explaining Erwins character to Jean
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,broken_pieces,Brooooooo this episode üò©
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,techyme008,Question : Did Eren really ate Warhammer if it was all blood & guts?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FreshPancakesBacon,"Holy fucking shit, man. I've been busy and just sat down to watch this episode. Absolutely fucking incredible, and one my personal favorite of the entire series.

This episode is the bass drop to the 6-episode buildup, that somehow itself felt like a series of small bass drops."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,itsslimshadyyo,"ok so after this episode, we can assume the warhammer titan is dead. personally i thought it was disappointing and i wanted to see some more fights with her. :("
itsslimshadyyo,Sarazan97,"On the bright side, we will probably see eren using the combined powers of the attack titan and the warhammer titan, that's surely something!"
Sarazan97,Positive_Magician_52,"What powers does attack titan have tho? It just feels like a normal titan with intelligence tbh. The only thing mentioned in the series is that it keeps ""moving forward"". I'm an anime only so no spoilers pls."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lildeathgrips,Don‚Äôt know about the rest of you but I think those episode had the best animation/cgi so far this season!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pixelbeast07,Such a great episode. I was so happy to see all of them that I almost got tears in my eyes. Lmao. Armin's entrance was badass. And Damn Eren was playing with Galliard. Enjoyed it so much. Absolute Masterpiece. üî•üî•üî•
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kid__Winchester,"I feel like using Gilliard to eat the war hammer titan opens a huge new can of worms. We can only assume that Annie is still crystalized based off Eren's surprise at the crystal scratching, indicating that this is the first time they've seen crystal being damaged. This now means if Eren (or anyone else) manages to eat the Jaw titan, they may be able to free Annie and eat her as well. Big things to come..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MASISCH,"Another absolutely awesome episode. My biggest question, is since Eren used the Jaw Titan to crack the War Hammer ""shell"", who inherits the titan? Both Eren and the Jaw obviously got a taste. Interested to see what's next"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vadus101,so was armin that tall soldier that separated pieck and porco from zeke? or jean or somebody else? since pieck said they seemed familiar i assume it‚Äôs a main character
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daroons,"I wonder when we'll see the scene between Levi and Zeke in the season 4 trailer?

Looks to take place on Paradis island so possibly a flashback?? Did Zeke somehow find a way back to the island during the past 4 years to hatch a plan with the Islanders??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rice-Paddy-Daddy,"So, do you guys think Zeke is dead or alive? Levi set off an explosion on his nape but I‚Äôm not sure if the writers will just let him bow out like that"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hemisby,"man this episode was really amazing but when gabi and falco were calling out to Reiner, even I wanted him to make a comeback. I dont even know who i want to win this war anymore. I really just want everyone to stop fighting smh :("

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jd_grime,I was literally at the edge of my seat the whole episode üò©üòÇ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NoobyDooo,"Kinda have this theory where I think Eren's gonna swallow all the titans one by one and then commit self-oof to wipe them off the face of the planet. Since he can't kill himself (because the powers would then just go to a random Eldian child), I think he'll freeze himself like Annie did or something. Highly unlikely, still."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Whereismyhempwick,I love how Reiner just wants to go to sleep... forever. And yet the poor guy can‚Äòt die.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chipthehippie,I'm glad to see the anti-cgi community has kinda shut up after this EP. The animation and the fast paced scenes were PHENOMENAL
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lazygood4notin,I was pretty critical with the CGI/animation this season but this episode was SICK
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gamerz905,"I love the fact that Marley brought this upon themselves. For years they probed Paradis, sending in titans, fighting the 'devils' whilst being one themselves. Now the true devil (Eren) appeared and his humanity is clearly gone.

But one thing just doesn't escape my mind. How did the Owl knew about Mikasa and Armin before they were born? Is the story cyclical? I feel that this is going to be a major plotline later."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Changlini,I think I'm at the point where if there is anyone worth rooting for: It's the people who've had enough of this traumatic shit and just want it to end.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NonFatPrawn,"This episode was absurdly good, I really didn't think the War Hammer was gonna die because the animation was taking a while so I was like 'nah somethings gonna stop it in time' but no she fucking died"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrMxylptlyk,"A tribute to all the scout members who joined just to be washed away by monkes and piecks barrage.


Also I would absolutely have taken a rocket to the face to get pieck out of there at the end."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Serniebanders69,"we've been all developing with eren for the past 3 seasons, but this isn't eren anymore. i dont know whose side to be on, I feel bad for all the characters.   


on one hand I sympathize with Eren and want him to have his revenge, he lost his mom, the scouts have lost so many comrades(erwin), they've faced so much pain, but at the same time the warriors are products off the system, they've been brainwashed to do what they need to do, and at the end off the day they are genuinely good people. Eren just has to keep doing what he needs to do, there's no out off it. I just don't know who to root for at this point. 

&#x200B;

There's no coming back from realizing that this entire time your whole life has been dedicated to killing off titans, your own countrymen, people that wanted to be free, just like you. They've been exterminating themselves."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PharaohSco,"This episode was honestly hard to watch at times, but in the best way. It really makes you almost feel bad for the citizens. I kept having to remind myself that reason they are being so cold and murdering everyone is because every person there has witnessed countless friends and family brutally murdered by the titans these people made, their whole lives. You can tell that all of them are still hesitant and remorseful, but know what has to be done. It's interesting seeing Reiner wake up at the end of the episode and how his Titan has changed.   


I could be wrong, but does it seem like Reiner has a mentality that everything that has happened is his doing? The whole season has eluded to the fact that Reiner knew that something like this would happen some day.  


Sorry for the long post, but can someone tell me, did Levi kill himself along with Zeke? It just seemed like Levi's whole goal was to avenge the commander, and then took himself out with Zeke in the end."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SlappaDaBayssMon,"Stupid question: Galliard, Pock, and Porco are three names for the same person (Jaw Titan), correct?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Faust_8,"One thing that keeps on bugging me.

Season 1, the Colossal Titan can just--poof--appear right behind you, nothing really happens.

Then when Reiner and Bertholdt reveal themselves (Season 3?) the Colossal Titan appearing is a lot of steam.

Only in Season 4-5 is the Colossal Titan appearing a FUCKING NUCLEAR BOMB.

Why the inconsistency in how violent the Colossal Titan transformation is? I don't think I've noticed any other plot holes like this before so the fact that this seems to exist is bugging me.

I mean, *maybe* the user can, like, choose how violent the transformation is? But that's purely a guess and is in no way mentioned in the series."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NeoRosePolitan,"Eren really used Armin in the same way Reiner and friends used Bertholdt. Both saw the devastation and destruction of thousands of lives, knowing they'd never be able to forget it. The Collossus Titan has a grand price to pay, it seems. Maybe that's why it shed a tear when Armin first inherited it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nartlimani_2007,I honestly thought this ep was amazing. Animation was awesome (even though some scenes looked kinda wonky especially when one of the survey corps members gets past the beast titan and porco comes right after him). Titans look great. Colossal titan is in 2d instead of 3d (kind of a reverse now every titan is 3d meanwhile colossal is 2d). Character design looks awesome (since it really replicates the manga artstyle which i like). Overall great episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,samgo88,so Eren's titan can talk now ?
samgo88,Za106,"I guess so, since he now  has the War hammer Titan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GucciAddict,This was one of the most perfect and beautful episodes of anime i have ever watched. Every episode in this season has left me in chills and hard breathing. The only time an episode has left me in such a shock was mastered ultra instinct
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,samgo88,"   
gabi annoys me"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-HeisenBird-,"The CGI looked much better this episode. Jaws, Cart, Armor and Colossal looked amazing in action. Beast a little less so since he moves a lot slower. I just wish Eren looked better. His scenes look like videogame cut scenes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MatrixTitanHr,"The animation was much better this episode, the CGI blended so much batter in the animation. Story awesome as always. 10/10 episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Mikasa looked so sad when she saw how brutal Eren was in cracking the warhammer egg using the jaw Titan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gameburn,"Attack on Titan is going the way of Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. 

Perfection. Its on par with the best books I've read. 

The depiction of the brutality of war. Hammers in the bits of WW1 and 2 about brutal those wars were. 

Absolute Perfection"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,redokonogi,Damn Armin's titan is looking GOOOOOD. Eren finally gets a chance to drink something after doing three sweaty transformations
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gbot418,Since eren ate war hammer does he get extra years to live with Ymir‚Äôs curse? Been really confused on this
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PhanThief95,"Me when I saw the small boat: ‚ÄúIs Armin on it?‚Äù

Me when I saw Armin: ‚ÄúOH, THAT NAVY‚ÄôS FUCKED!!!‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,baldeagle86,"I liked how they are all standing protecting Zeke, and the second they get distracted Levi attacks. 

Also there‚Äôs no way either of them are dead. Levi used the grenade to blow open the nape, there‚Äôs probably going to be some dialogue at least before Zeke gets killed. Zeke might even be taken captive somehow to chat with Eren, who knows. Main characters never die off screen..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,turbokat123,"Well im glad to see my comment age well, yay!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,69macncheese69,"Disclaimer: I think attacking mappa staff and anything of the sort is absolutely despicable and disgusting human behavior, makes me as disappointed in the human race as people making death threats when they don't like something. Peak human retardation.

Plot, direction and music wise the episode was awesome, so far each new episode has been better than the last. That said, I could only feel sad as I watched what could have been one of the most awesome action scenes so far held back by animation. I'm sure mappa is doing the best they can with the time they were given, cutting only the necessary corners due to time constraints and during non-busy scenes the art and animation is just as good as it's always been. But during the action scenes it doesn't compare, the cgi is very noticeable and immersion breaking and the camera angles are not nearly as complex. I tried thinking of it more like an animated manga with voices instead of a full on anime but I still couldn't help feeling sad that we couldn't keep the 10/10 going on this final stretch. I feel like once again people are only thinking in complete extremes, either being full on hateful dicks or praising mappa to high heaven for a flawless adaptation even better than seasons 1-3 and nobody is being honest/fair. They are obviously very skilled and passionate and that shows, they did their best with what they were given and they deserve our respect for that. However the compromises are obvious and that's the truth of it imo. It's not bad but it doesn't hold up to the standard it's set so far which imo has been a benchmark for the industry in general. Even if we had to wait another 2 years I'd have much preferred that personally instead of a rushed adaptation. Once again people in suits who want the money and don't give a shit have messed with something people love, and mappa who are doing their best to patch up their shitty decision are taking all the backlash. I wanted to get my moderate opinion out there and off my chest."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lil_quarantine,I love how the dude who gets shot in the cart titan has pictures of his friends and faimly stuck up. This show will make you care about every character!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Neversoft4long,"Damn Piecks panzer unit getting wrecked was the only Marly deaths that I felt bad for. Those dudes seemed like chill guys and they were definitely simping for Pieck. And she cared about them which was nice to see. I also liked that we got to see more of Piecks tactical thinking. Outside of Zeke she‚Äôs the best strategist among the Warriors and we got to see that this episode, even to the point of Zeke acknowledging it. If you can‚Äôt tell I really like Pieck"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SamSparkSLD,"Saw some comments on here asking about what happened to zeke. 

I thought it was weird that Levi would just blow him up, when it seemed like Eren was aiming to get all the titan power he could. What if Zeke is a traitor and the bomb was cover up to slip him out of there. That‚Äôs why he knew about the time with Levi because he was in on the plan. 

That‚Äôs just my theory though"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ivrt2,"So thinking about it, eren shouldnt eat jaw. Have armin eat jaw. Fast and agile colossal titan would be absolutely terrifying."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pokechap,Those scouts got absolutely pulped by peick‚Äôs artillery. Also I felt so bad when the artillery people died.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Was99m,How did porco know Mikasa is an Ackerman? He called her an Ackerman before charging at her in a scene.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GeoTech84,"After seeing Armins transformation into the Colossal and basically going nuclear, it reminded me that we saw young Berthold do something similar a few episodes back. 

This has me wondering why berthold didn‚Äôt go ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù when they attacked the wall instead of just kicking one tiny hole?"
GeoTech84,kelsier69,I'm pretty sure it's because he was standing in the sea and the Colossal Titan being super hot is what caused the explosion.
kelsier69,GeoTech84,Oh that would make sense but we also saw young berthold do it on land so they seem to be able to control the size of the eruption
GeoTech84,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,"Berts goal was not to kill as many people as possible like Armins was, it was simply to create a big enough distraction so that him Annie and Reiner could sneak in unnoticed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaninenlove,I believe and really hope Zeke is'nt out just yet. Having him get one-shotted while not paying attention is not really an ending as you would expect for a character like him.
Kaninenlove,hrdp453,"You're right, it doesn't make sense. We saw he had PTSD from Levi's attack in S3. It doesn't seem right that he would be this overconfident in their next meeting."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ElijahDesu,"Nonetheless. 

I‚Äôm with eren til the end of the lineü§ù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xetr3,This episode was phenomenal. I'm still a bit salty about how they did my boy zeke with the beast titan cgi though. Every other titan looks significantly better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,saiful_458,Every time Levi was on screen you knew shit was about to go down
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PatientExplanation,Seeing the Marlians and Honorary Marlians getting rekt feels soo good. Finally some justice.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mega-cunt,I have a quick question about the last episode...is Levi fucking dead. Like did he just suicide bomb zeke and that‚Äôs it or did I miss something??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-REXIA-,Bruh anyone notice at the end Reiners Armored Titan looked different? Idk they could evolve like that..
-REXIA-,Olddude112,"Ye. It was like all messed up, probably reflected his mental state or just his physique matured over the years."
Olddude112,-REXIA-,"Op nvm I read it wrong, turns out it‚Äôs just an incomplete version of the armored titan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Einstein_Butcooler,"So hear me out, if the jaw titan cracked the crystal couldnt he just swallow the tybur lady, it would be rather easy for him to do it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rissabae,"This episode had me jumping up and down and talking to the TV. It was so good! I was really worried and told me friend things are looking bleak... but then all hell broke lose and the tables turned bc they did not come to play. Omg It was amazing. But the slow parts had me worried the episode was going to end then and there, I couldn‚Äôt relax lol 

Highlights: Armin transformed like an atomic bomb and destroyed the entire navy.

Levi and Zeke. Zeke was so arrogant he was ready for Levi but he wasn‚Äôt really ready. It was an awesome attack, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs dead."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LuisAntony2964,hype.They did the colossal titan and the nutcracker scene justice
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,overbree,"Marley and the warriors: ""woah that should be enough to stop Eren""
*giornos theme starts playing
Eren: *makes a new titan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,miapjm13,istg i rewatched this episode 3 times. Its probably one of the best episodes yet
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,miapjm13,I literally scream everytime Levi appears. There is no strong character that gets me this hyped. And the way he had zeke done in literally a second and so suddenly
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JordanIII,"Is it just me, or was Armin's explosion way bigger than Bertolt's??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnselLovesNuts,Got dm‚Äôd spoilers randomly lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bearnum,It felt good watching the Marleans and warriors perish. I‚Äôm 100% on Eren‚Äôs side on this. Fuck them up. They brought this on themselves.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frosty4019,"*Reiner went full chad
*Armin seems conflicted as a big boy
*Eren is 100% going crazy with  power 

Its all coming together guys. This show doesnt stop giving."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WBWelshthrowaway,"How did the Marleyans know that both Levi and Mikasa are Ackermanns? Levi only found out halfway through S3 he was one, and Reiner had left by then so obviously he hadn't told Marley. 

A spy? or writing error?"
WBWelshthrowaway,Kbains01,If the Marleyans and the Eldians are at war it‚Äôs likely they both have and are using spies.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,x_TDeck_x,I'm pretty sure I've become part of the problem the show is highlighting. I don't really care about Marley or what they want. I just wanna see Marley get torn the fuck up.
x_TDeck_x,Badalight,At least the irony isn't lost on you.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GRF123456789,"Like the Johnny Test meme
Zeke: Why did you resist a police officer?
Eren: Why are you guys police officers?
Armin: I blew up Malaysia"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OGFN_Jack,"Gabi is truly insufferable to the highest degree. She was gleefully killing soldiers for their freedom in the first episode yet now the nation of people her own country invaded out of the blue is coming for revenge she is all of a sudden the victim? Give me a break, Falco is a 10x more interesting character than Gabi."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tempics,I legitimately had to pause in the middle of the show to gather wtf just happened. My heart beat is going crazy rn
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Videogamer2719,How do y‚Äôall watch the episode so early? I can‚Äôt find any links with subs
Videogamer2719,Gergex,I watch on Hulu
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Coochieslayer696969,Anyone else notice that Reiners titan looks different??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,humbledeviant4,Holy fucking shit
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sekiro811,Anyone having trouble watching it on funimation?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,at this point the damages made by the shinganshina attack + trost attack do not even make 30% of what was made by this assault. so much destruction that i feel bad that things turned out this way.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DemonicLemon02,The music this episode was fucking spot on but did Levi fucking suicide bomb Zeke?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lucky_mlz,"Zeke said: ""You don't have much time, do you, Levi?"" While Levi was timing the Zepellin's arrival. Meaning Zeke knows about their plan. I knew something was up with him, i think there's more than meets the eye here folks!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,danielwilu2525,Levi wasted no time fulfilling Erwin‚Äôs promise when he had the chance
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kh0a,holy shit that episode was crazy
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAmInside,This anime is so fucking good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,beatup149,Eyo I thought Armin was the soldier who trapped pieck and the jaw titan. But this episode Armin shows up without a beard in a boat with other clothes. Who tf was that soldier then? Does anynody have any speculations or thoughts?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maruchanmaster,Man if eren somehow eats porco and Reiner he solos the rest of the verse low diff

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,drank_your_water,WHO WAS THAT TALL SOLIDER CAUSE IT CERTAINLY WASNT ARMIN
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BootySatanTheSequel,"I think this episode is one of the greatest pieces of anime I have ever seen. To me, this trumps anything we've seen in season 4 and anything we've previously seen. I can't remember the last time I was so hyped after watching a single episode of a show but wow this episode was absolutely amazing. 

Just a few thoughts:

\- We didn't directly see Zeke die like we did with Lara, so I'm willing to bet that we'll get more of him

\- Reiner seems to be fed up with everyone and everything, interesting to see how that will play out

\- It'll be cool to see how Eren utilizes the war hammer's powers

\- How long after season 3 is this season set? Do we know?

\- Porco and Pieck had it coming"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DemonicLemon02,"When Armin says ""so this is the view you saw...Bertolt"" does that mean that was the first time Armin used the collosal?"
DemonicLemon02,Clumulus,"It's been 4 years, so I doubt it. More the viewing the death and destruction from up on high."
Clumulus,DemonicLemon02,Ahhh I cant believe my small pea brain couldn't figure that out ü§£
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Danes07,"I haven't seen a comment regarding Falco and Magath. I mean that when Magath saw Falco his instinct was to make sure he's okay. I'm pretty sure I don't have to explain why that hurts me, but it really hit me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ksabski,"Damn Eren is on a quest to become some Pok√©mon trainer, collecting them all. He might be able to take on the Elite Four!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dousy_32,Do we think the woman who wished Willy good luck two episodes back will come into play? My guess is she may try to aid the Paradis escape?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,awesomecooper,"There are no winners in Wars. No one is wrong in their own perspective for the war but in the end it's the people who did.  Again that said, paradise is at a massive disadvantage in case Marley actually attack Paradise. This is the only option paradise has. You need to give up your humanity to have a tiny hope of saving your people. I'm sure paradise and Eren's end goal is peace but this has to happen."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Soccerfreakgod,WHAT DO I DO WITH SO MUCH HYPE??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,1of1000,Can we talk about how good the colossal titan looked this episode? We haven't see it look that awesome since episode 1 imo. This episode was even better than last weeks. My goodness!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xdaienkai,"Zeke is really sus this season when I think about it. Wouldn't it have been more effective to trap the three of them together in that well(?)? Why was he taken somewhere else?

There was also that wiretap scene in a previous episode when he said something and that he wouldn't want to discuss it ""in this room"". What does he have to hide from the Marleyan officers?

And that line he said. The subbed version I watched translated it as ""Eren is no match for me"" but I'm fairly sure he said something along the lines of ""„Ç®„É¨„É≥„ÅØ‰ø∫„ÅÆÁöÑ„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ"" which could also be taken to mean ""Eren is not my enemy"".... Maybe he was just saying that he was looking to defeat Levi instead, but idk it just seemed a bit off to me... especially considering everything else I've noticed so far.

Then again, what possible motive could he have for aiding the people of Paradis Island? It's very likely that I'm looking too much into it, but I guess it's just something to think about. Anyways, that was a fantastic episode!!!!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,strategistknight,I love Jean I empathize with him the most but he shouldn't have hesitated. His moment of hesitation caused the cart titan to get away. PS loved to see Porco destroyed and made a literal nutcracker XD
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,switchblade2,"Is it possible that Porco ate the War Hammer ""egg"" rather than Eren? When I watched it I wasn't super convinced that Eren ate her before porco could have"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,McFlare92,Well I was right about the lights being a beacon for evac
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Former_Sea,Okay I know it‚Äôs not right and all that but man I am having so much fun seeing mainland people getting brutally murdered and all that. I love how creative murderer Eren has become. And the nuclear bomb titan? Well that‚Äôs just the desert after the main food.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hazemak,"So like genuine question but there's no way this actually ends in 16 episodes right?
There's still so much to reveal"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,khalil_is_not_here,"Holy shit what an episode. Levi vs the Beast titan wasn't even a match, just an absolute curb stomp. If he's actually dead then holy shit but if he isn't I guess they have plans to use his royal blood somehow or they're just trying to get all the titans they can. 

The Armin and Bertholdt parallels are agonizing but it seems like him and Eren are on the same page for the most part. 

R.I.P the Warhammer titan holy shit. That scene was absolutely brutal to watch. It was so slow going that I was waiting for the fake out but damnnn they really went there and I'm so glad they did. 

This is easily my favorite episode so far, it was so packed with action."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdaptiveMadMan,"Remember Galliard giving Reinar shit for having to get saved on Paradise?  

Funny."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cacahueteuwu,"Talking about Zeke possibly being undercover, did Levi purposefully stab one of his swords in the Monke shoulder as a signal to prepare for the explosion?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Za106,I am so PROUD of Armin and Eren in this episode. They showed off HARD.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-ShaiHulud-,"Just have to make this observation about Zeke. A lot of people were theorising in past episode discussions that Zeke must have been the rat conspiring with Paradis. This episode pretty much just confirmed this: Zeke saying Eren is not his enemy, the Beast titan getting ""attacked"" while everyone is distracted without even a hint of putting up a fight, Levi ""killing"" Zeke in a very demonstrative fashion right before the eyes of Magath by throwing a bomb. I'm willing to bet money Zeke is on his way to that Zeppelin right now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GrandMasterRimJob,How FUCKING AWESOME was Pieck's titan voice?????
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chennsta,Reiner with the butt chin
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SongstressInDistress,"No one's gonna talk about Hange? The first time we see her then she proceeds talking about how Armin is like Erwin. Goddamn. Hange is leading the survey corps now, right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,woahysenia,"This episode was so bad ass I am completely speechless. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to say, or to even comprehend as to what had happen. Everyone had literally the biggest character glow up and development that they are not the same from past seasons and honestly I love it. We finally see them showing no mercy and it‚Äôs so crazy. Everyone is becoming merciless and violent and I‚Äôm so here for it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pineapple_is_Gud,"Bruh I was so happy when the other warriors joined the fight. Man, I was about to cry when they got taken out one by one. When Reiner showed up, I thought I saw Jesus."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,omohami,"100% satisfied with this episode. Glad to see Marley getting the ass whopping they deserve. Eren badass level is through the roof. 

The thing I love the most is how we‚Äôre seeing the other scouts actually be competent and threatening (mostly Sasha, Jean and Connie.) This whole time Levi and Mikasa has been outshining them, but they‚Äôre definitely putting in some work after the time skip.

Also, anyone know what Levi was keeping track of the time for? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs to be able to rendezvous with Hanji, but unsure if that‚Äôs the reason."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PettyFlacko00,Cant wait to see what they‚Äôve got on that blimp. This was easily the best episode of television I‚Äôve ever watched. Seeing eren use the jaw titan like that was pure art.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loophi,Any theory about Reiner transformation?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tinseltopia,"Where did they get a zeppelin from? Surely Paradis doesn't have the technology to create one?

Either way, fantastic episode - everything I wanted and more!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,whoopashigitt,"This season it definitely feels more like they're using the titans as mechs. They can just pop out of them and talk and stuff, and then just crawl back in now. They also are able to talk and move their human heads inside the titans now too."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Doodooltala01,"Eren had that ""I need one last fix"" look when he was using the Jaw titan to as a nutcracker

Sidenote: I'm so glad that the anime adaption wasn't a let down"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kermit_Memelord,"What bothers me about the war hammers death is the fact that while she was getting crushed, she never closed her eyes or looked away from eren. It's almost as if she was trying to say ""this isn't over"". Scary"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YamFor,That Eren Porco scene was something else. Ripped his arms off and forced him to bite down. Wild
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MayGong,"have the strongest feeling that Zeke might join the other side later. He was saying ""Levi you're running out of time"" while Levi was watching his clock. So Zeke defo knows smth and be knowingly stuck down."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoreMegadeth,"Is it possible Zeke retreated out of his titan body before Levi‚Äôs attack? Beast titan is completely still during the attack and doesn‚Äôt react to Pieck‚Äôs warning at all, even facially. Plus they never show his dead body afterwards, or parts of it. Also, it kinda looked like Levi suicide bombed for a second."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,notarsalaanahsan,I have a question. It's not related to tonight's episode. So we know that a regular titan transforms into one of the nine titans if they eat them. And that's how Eren got the Attack and Founding titan powers. But didn't Eren get eaten by the Santa titan in season 1? Shouldn't that dude have inherited those two titans from Eren? Or did Eren get out before dying? I'm sure it's a stupid question.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TraditionalRedditor,The absolute chills I got when Galliard finally realised what eren was doing had me like O:
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,moron_goron,Armin‚Äôs face before and after transforming was heartbreaking
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,max1001,"So, they can make a turret mount for the cart titan but nobody thought it would be a good idea to make some sort of neck protectors to cover the nape?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ice_Huck_Ticks,"I genuinely wanted to see what would happen if Eren actually ate Porco, or what his titan would look like."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reaperqueen95,So can eren now transform into the warhammer titan or what I'm kinda confused on how it works
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,berenicee34,"Just saw the episode and WOW, I loved every single second of it! Eren is just something else now it‚Äôs crazy"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Finnsen17,Eren has so much stamina. 3 Transformation's in such short time.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aReasson,Pieck running out of the flames was so disturbing. I love this show.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dongrizzly41,Gotta show my girl Sasha some love. Great mf shot!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dinosaurfondue,"This season of AOT has been insanely good but one of my biggest gripes with action shows is when an enemy or the heroes have a chance to obtain their goal but then just wait and do nothing.

Eren had the fucking jaw titan in his hands and could have easily taken a bite but instead just kind of stands there.... and waits.... and does nothing. It's stupid."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Paulicorn,"So what would have happened had Eren eaten the jaw titan? Would he get like stronger jaws and claws or something? When he ate the Hammer titan it didn‚Äôt look like much physically had changed. As well, if he did eat the jaw titan and got cool jaws and claws, what about if he ate the female titan? Attack titan with titties???"
Paulicorn,illumantimess,"Seems like because war hammer‚Äôs primary power is being able to make any weapon with hardening, Eren will have that power without changing his physical form. The Jaw titan also looked much different under Ymir so maybe it‚Äôll just make Eren‚Äôs bite harder"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SAvkE456,"I think Eren could've just quickly ate Galliard, ya know a quickie bite nothing too time consuming, but I'll get over it.."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ReinerBraun77,I really felt bad for Reiner at the end..It was like he just wanted to die because of all his conscience and stuff and yet he had to fight again..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kurapikachu64,Okay. Seven episodes in now and this is already my favorite season. Fuck.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Velysto,Porco got disrespected even harder than those military leaders that Eren dive bombed last episode. I didn't think they could top that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kylorambe,Man what the hell this episode was amazing. It‚Äôs crazy to me to see all the people that we‚Äôve seen in the shown and see how they‚Äôve all changed. Sasha is a badass sniper now and in season 1 she just wanted to eat her potatoes and meat lol. I loved this episode so much
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Codepool,"One thing I don't understand- why is Eren eating all Titans? Wouldn't it be better if 3 people had Titan powers instead of a single dude having 3 Titan powers (founder-attack, War hammer, jaw)?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mukino,the shots of the aftermath of the Armin bomb gave me chills.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BiNannery,"This season is looking like a really good season. The tone, the atmospheres, and the pacing are all so perfect. Every single action sequence is so well choreographed and thought out. The only real gripe I have here is the CG but well, can't really complain about it since MAPPA didn't have enough time to polish it up on the same level as Wit, but oh well."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PurgatoryGFX,I feel like the beast titan death happened to casually/quick.. maybe he‚Äôs not dead.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YetiManDude342,"This episode brings up a question for me. The power of the Titans is transferred through eating the current user of the power, more specifically that users spinal fluid. In the shot where erenn eats the Warhammer we clearly see that he's holding porco in a way to where he couldn't get any of the spinal fluid but let's say hypothetically eren ate some of the spinal fluid and porco ate some, who would get the power of the Titan, would they both get the power of the Titan, would the person who drank the most spinal fluid get the power of the Titan, would porco get the power of the Titan because eren already has the power of two Titans and porco only has the power of one Titan. A question will probably never get an answer to but I just wanted to get other people's opinions on what would happen."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EdleRitter,"Holy shit the amount of disrespect in this episode

* Zeke T-poses, gets sniped

* The entire navy and half the city just gone. 

* The entire panzer crew up in smoke

* NUTCRACKER TITAN"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZlinkyNipz,oh my god armins enterance was legit the cleanest most hype thing ive ever seen
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Roseandwolf,"Zeke: im ready to fight LEVI and show off in front of everyone.

Immediately gets fucked

Lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chillywillyG,So if Zeke can turn Eldians into pure titans by shouting how come he didn‚Äôt do that knowing the scouts were all Eldians? Am I misinterpreting one of his powers? Is he worried about the other civilians/his comrades being killed by those titans? Does it take more than just shouting? Idk but what a great episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,Can anyone explain why Armin's transformation was basically a nuke? We've seen Berthodt transform before and it never looked like that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Syncopatedteen,"It made so fu*kin happy seeing our ""devils""  take control of the battle and wreak havoc. Ik this entire attack is similar to the mission Riener and others had many years go and makes us feel how horrible the vicious cycle of hatred and revenge is but THEY'VE gone thru SOO much and I legit don't care abt Marley at this point I just need to see a huge win for eren and the others xD...which Ik won't happen that easily"
Syncopatedteen,Badalight,You're kind of missing the point though. This isn't a win for Paradis. This is a win for Eren. No one else is happy about this fight except him. Mikasa is upset. Armin is upset. None of them want to be doing this. Eren forced their hand.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ChiefSaltyPanda,This season just keeps getting better
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SuspiciousDinner420,Try Titan Juice. It'll quench ya! It's the quenchiest!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mekoomi,BEST BOY ARMIN LETS GOOOOOO
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oooshyguy,My man Eren has three titan powers now broooo what‚Äôs it about to turn out like? You think he‚Äôll be able to use the war hammer abilities? Or will there be a catch like with the founding Titan abilities? This episode was so hype. Can‚Äôt help but feel bad for the candidates but still screw Marley.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,robmeister123,What a masterpiece! I just kept saying Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh Shit!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Darth_Peverell,"Just finish that bite, Eren!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rayanator69,Does anybody remember when Eren was stuck like Reiner was? It all makes sense now; He didn't have a will to live
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,explorethesky,"I haven‚Äôt seen anyone talking about this but here‚Äôs a detail I noticed about Zeke: we saw that he can turn Eldians into pure/mindless titans somehow both in Connie‚Äôs village and in one of the early s4 episodes when they fell out of the plane. I wonder why Zeke wouldn‚Äôt use this power to transform the Paradisans attacking into Titans? I know this would cause issues for Marley somewhat, including their soldiers that were there. But it seems like he can direct them somewhat, and think about it: a mindless titan Mikasa or Levi or Sasha is much less dangerous to the Marleyans than a trained scout with ODM gear and a plan they‚Äôre unaware of. He also could have done this during the suicide run at the end of season 3, all of those soldiers would have been more useful to them as Titans than as fodder right? Maybe there is something I‚Äôm missing as I don‚Äôt read the manga and this power hasn‚Äôt been fleshed out in the anime. Anyways, this leads me to think along the lines of some of the theories I‚Äôve seen: Could Zeke be working with Paradis now? Doesn‚Äôt seem like he died when Levi demolished him from behind based on the fact that we didn‚Äôt see his physical death, and Eren had the baseball glove with his letters which seemed like a nod to Zeke. I can‚Äôt foresee him really joining with Paradis for unselfish purposes but it could make sense given what we‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôm honestly dreading the next episode, worried about what Gabi is gonna do."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,S_targaryen,Anyone else notice the parallels between Gabi and Falco & Eren and Mikasa? Things are definitely coming full circle. The victims have become the tormentors. Eren is gonna haunt these kids' nightmares- just like the paradis titans did his.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Littletom523,Ok now after seeing the blimp I am super curious how Paradis looks.. how much of that place has changed? Looks like the scouts have been very busy updating everything.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kartickjonty4,"So it seems that the tall person who caught piek and galliard earlier, was not Armin.. Who was it then? I guess someone is helping them from inside."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,epem123,Everyone talking about everyone except my girl sasha man. The shot gave me chills
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thecamned,I can't help but root for the eren and everyone but they definitely seem to be committing the same atrocities that had been committed to them
thecamned,Griever114,"The problem is, Marley forced his hand."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dorkinator3000,The fucking art style is insane. This season has been so fucking incredible I audibly go holy shit every episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Atchfam77,"Armin‚Äôs entrance was beautiful. So satisfying to see the Liberio harbor get nuked. On top of that, it‚Äôs bittersweet knowing one of the most pure-hearted characters has to bear the weight of such a massacre. It‚Äôs a necessary evil and Armin knows that, yet it‚Äôs still a moral weight he must carry. Top tier writing there, we wouldn‚Äôt have had such character development with Erwin as the Colossal Titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadZeus007,If Eren doesn't summon hammers and swords in the future i'm gonna be mad dissapointed... This is setting up PURE GREATNESS!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arad156,How could Paradis go from horses and carts to airships in 4 years?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crash18867,I dont understand how but this show gets better every episode. This season alone has made this show my favorite series of all time
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DcentLiverpoolMuslim,Porco got all of Reiner's PTSD in a single episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Basc63,I really hope Zeke isn‚Äôt actually dead. Levi has been waiting to kill him for years and to see him go out like that is underwhelming.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gigi_1803,Really want Levi to become a Titan shifter. That is if an Ackermann can. Marley is doomed in that case. But it wouldn't happen because then they wouldn't even have a chance.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Grammar---Police,"So will Eren now be able to use the Warhammer Titan‚Äôs abilities? Can he do it as the Attack Titan, or does he have to do the same crystallized egg thing? I guess we don‚Äôt really have a reference for what happens when two completely different titans are possessed by the same person."
Grammar---Police,illumantimess,I don't know if the crystallized egg thing is even necessary for the War Hammer titan? Seems like that was a strategic choice by Lara Tybur to misdirect their focus on her nape.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,slaiyfer,How do the Marleyans know that Mikasa and Levi were Ackermans just by looking at them?
slaiyfer,gigglychicken,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I think only the jaw titan pointed them out and I think he inherited the memory of Ymir. Zeke and Reiner might have shared information regarding their existence too"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hesawavemasterrr,"Pieck: it‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs fine. We got reinforcements! They‚Äôre cornered.

Armin: reverse uno ü•≤"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,venusaires,I love how Marley got a ‚ÄúColossal Titan over the walls moment‚Äù but a lot worse
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,notarsalaanahsan,The fact that Eren's only major weakness is the absence of royal blood that stops him from accessing the powers of the founding titan and that Zeke has that one trait is a link that sits right on our faces. There has to be so much more going on with Zeke. No way he gets his ass handed to him so quick knowing full well what Levi was capable of.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reader575,What makes the female titan special? What happens if Eren or a guy eats the female titan?
Reader575,taskkill-IM,Trans Titan?
Reader575,JooK8,"Idk they stated high mobility and fast on the spot hardening.  But Eren got that by drinking an XP potion.

Maybe there's more to it, but they also said it's best for the best fighter, which would be Annie."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rillamaster,"This reminds me of League of Legends.  Zeke being the ranged adc, pieck as the support, galliard as the bruiser.  All they have to do is peel for the adc but immediately everyone ditches him and the assassin just one shots the carry."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,inf3ct3dn0n4m3,I got caught up on Attack on Titan last night/this morning. I've been up all night and have work in an hour. Send help. I literally couldn't stop everything was just popping off.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,albmrbo,Anyone else seeing the massive The Last of Us Part 2 parallels?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZeroMcFly,"I don't know if anyone has mentioned it but when Gabi and Falco are screaming for Reiner, the voice acting man. It sounded like real desperation, shit turned around so quickly. Even though I never felt for the Marleyans and still don't that part got me, it was like damn we could really be obliterated at this point."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mrkhan2000,somebody else feel like Erin is turning into Khalisi from GOT season 8? I just hope this anime doesn't end like GOT.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SerjCaiyo,just watched it. i now have immense hate for gabi braun she screeches like a banshee in the end and her voice was ear piercingly annoying. i want the arrogant bitch to die
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SerjCaiyo,if gabi wasn‚Äôt a child eren would‚Äôve yeeted porco‚Äôs body towards that building
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Graize,"He's most likely still alive, but I couldn't stop laughing when Levi takes down the best titan, gives the Warrior candidates a middle finger, then blows himself up."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JooK8,If a Titan shifter is killed and isn't consumed by anyone does the Titan power just randomly manifest in one of the other Eldians?  Or am I just thinking of some other shit like Sirens in Borderlands
JooK8,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,Yeah some random Eldian baby will be born with the Titan power.
Spokane_Lone_Wolf,hrdp453,"Is it said in the show if the newborn can be in Paradis, Marley or either?"
JooK8,psychonaut4020,It goes to a new born child of Eldian descent
psychonaut4020,JooK8,"Alright thanks, so I'm not just making shit up, it was mentioned sometime. :)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IcyyFaux,"Wait so who was the person who trapped cart titan, Zeke and all during the start of the invasion? I thought it was Armin but in this episode Armin comes from the boat. 
I'm probably forgetting if they reveled the guy I'm sorry but I just can't retain everything if I'm not binging it."
IcyyFaux,Bird_of_the_North,"Jean? Honestly i don't know either, I don't know many other blonde scouts. I thought that soldier was Armin too until the boat scene."
IcyyFaux,SippingTeaInYoHood,Pieck recognised them so it's either a random survey corp or a double agent in Marley
IcyyFaux,Glimglam,Annie with a fake beard.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kelsery,"Such a fantastic episode, I think my mouth was open the entire time watching it. Definitely screamed when I saw Armin transform haha. 

One thing that‚Äôs been bugging me since last episode is why did the bearded soldier leave Pieck and Gaillard unguarded after trapping them in the pit? Seems like an obvious oversight, unless I missed something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-_-620,I hope Levi didn‚Äôt die in that explosive battle with zeke
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nahog99,"Ok, no one's talking about this so I'm assuming(hoping) I'm wrong, but it *reaaaallly* looks like Levi blew himself up while on top of the beast titan."
nahog99,chknparmstrong,He definitely didn‚Äôt at all lol
nahog99,AMK2201,He didn't blow himself up. Why on earth would he do that lol.
AMK2201,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,Next episode will expand on Levi's issues with suicidal ideation.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,espectro11,"My wife brought up a good point last night, titan power holders only have 13 years to live Eren has no more than 5 but since he ate the warhammer, does the clock reset or will he lose both founder and attack titan?"
espectro11,JooK8,"Does not reset.  Not sure if it is mentioned explicitly, but we can assume so from Grisha.  Grisha ate the founding titan and quickly passed on both powers to Eren since he knew his time was almost up.  If he got another 13 years, surely he would not have entrusted everything to his 9 year old kid that had no idea what was going on."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JambaJake,Did Levi die?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jimmienoman,"I like how everyone is talking crap about Zeke and Levi.

Zeke never said Eren wasn‚Äôt his enemy but Levi was. Zeke said Eren wasn‚Äôt his enemy but someone else comes first. Then tells Levi to ‚ÄúShow yourself, Levi‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre running out of time‚Äù

Notice he doesn‚Äôt say Levi is his enemy either. Zeke definitely is working with Paradis at the moment. Wether it‚Äôs long term or short term will be seen soon and the reasons for it (probably to make Paradis an Eldian safe haven so the rest of the world leaves them alone if I had to guess)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,boboskiwattin,"aight, so annie gonna get wrecked like sister tybur now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cdntrooper19,Levi got no chill he went up and sliced zeke right out of there then went fire in the hole on his nape and blew zeke out of there
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,that1tallguy,Can anyone explain why Erin and the scouts weren‚Äôt vaporized along the edge of the wall in a nuke like explosion in season 1? Can the colossal titan control how large there transformation explosion is? That‚Äôs one of the only things that‚Äôs bothering me after seeing Armin completely fuck shit up.
that1tallguy,JooK8,"Seems that they can.  There was no nuke-like explosion prior to Bertoldt kicking down the wall in S1 and there was also no explosion when he transformed while they were atop the wall.  The explosion in S3 was also much smaller than the one Armin just made.  Bertoldt nuked a nation in the past so we know he was capable of doing it, he just didn't."
that1tallguy,yungyord,"I think for 2 reasons. 1. Armin was in the water, and introducing a very high heated object into water can cause an explosion. And 2. They‚Äôve all been putting in mad work training, so I‚Äôm sure Armin has really learned to hone his Titans abilities"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JesseGamez,"The moment I realized that by now I had developed sympathy for Reiner, it was clear to me: I believe that all the characters in this series will die. At least it must be said that no one deserves to live. What these devils are doing is just sick. Emotionally, I have rarely been as caught up and disturbed as I was after this episode. Great!"
JesseGamez,JooK8,"It's meant to show that there really isn't a right or wrong side.  They did a great job of making the audience feel for the Warriors even though they are entirely responsible for what happened on Paradis from S1-S3.  

In S1-S3 you don't know entirely want is going on and you just think that the warriors are evil assholes getting everyone killed for no reason.  You just feel the hatred Eren has and see all the suffering the Paradisians go through.  Now, you see on the exact opposite side, people like Gabi who has no idea why the scouts are doing what they are doing and from her PoV, they just fucked up Liberio for no reason.  In war, there is no right or wrong, both sides think they are right and everyone suffers for it.  

We know for sure that many of the big players will die soon like Eren, Reiner, Zeke, Pieck etc. since they are nearing the ends of their lifespans.  Armin's got 7 or 8 years left in him, but in war anyone could die at any time.  We'll see what happens.  I literally watched this episode 3 times on Sunday because it was that awesome."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YeyVerily96,"Does the 13 year time limit restart when another titan is eaten?.. No, right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ForChristSeiko,Anyone else get the feeling that Eren didn‚Äôt actually inherit the power of the War Hammer Titan?...I mean it was literally in the mouth of the Jaw Titan...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lmanop,"I've binged watched season 2 3 and 4 in 3 days.

Boy what a rolercoaster of emotions.

&#x200B;

During season 3 I was thinking, why won't they just nuke the titans or the enemies. 

How ironic."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dsayre1986,Man I hate that I got caught up. These episodes seem like they go by in 5 minutes and now I‚Äôm gonna have to wait for the next one...how have you all been doing this? The suspense is killing me!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,phramos07,"People are saying Levi vs Zeke was too fast. Well, let us remember that Zeke was absolutely in disadvantageous terrain. In their first encounter (S3) Zeke had the upper hand because of the open field, thus it took some thinking for Levi to approach Zeke without being noticed. This time around, however, Zeke was surrounded by buildings. GG."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,orb_outrider,It's 5 days old so I guess no one will know I'm gay for Armin.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lulumarques,"They are doing such an incredible job making us invested in the new characters in this short time, I'm not even rooting for Paradis anymore."
lulumarques,sassyaspho,They did do a great job at that but no way in hell did I spend 3 seasons with the Scouts to root for other team. Not saying I don‚Äôt feel bad for those in Marley. But let‚Äôs not forget who the main characters are here
lulumarques,Darknfullofhype,"Are you really not rooting for Paradis? I understand they're doing some despicable shit, but Marley was about to declare all out war and begin the next phase of genocide. All roads were leading to war, they just decided to strike first (which isn't even an accurate description given Marley already killed 25% of all humanity on Paradis with the attack of Shiganshina)"
lulumarques,masterstealth11,"I honestly agree with you. We are definitely in the minority here, but I feel like I‚Äôm on team Marley Titans. I mean, of course I don‚Äôt like what Marley is doing, but the Paradis Eldians are doing some serious war crimes and killing of innocents who aren‚Äôt involved at all"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,soozyYT,I feel gabis going to play some important role later.
soozyYT,aheze,I hope not
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Plague_Knight1,"This episode works really well because of the shift from Eren to Reiner as the protagonist. For 3 seasons now, we've seen what Marley did to Paradis, but in this arc, we see that Paradis is fully prepared to match their cruelty. 

With the roles of protagonist and antagonist switched between Eren and Reiner, the viewer is left uncertain about who to root for. 

This gives a sort of neutral ground to us as viewers, where the story doesn't force us to see one side as heroic and the other as villainous as it usually does, and we can appreciate the fight in full, from both viewpoints."
Plague_Knight1,masterstealth11,"I completely agree with you. It actually sort of makes me sad to see so many people saying ‚Äúfuck Marley, burn them all,‚Äù because Marley is like 95% innocent people, 5% evil oppressive masterminds. Just like any evil government. So it‚Äôs sad to see innocent people die"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Osmosis_Jones_,"Of all the episodes of season 4 so far, this one was the easiest to masturbate to"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,samreeennverymean,Cam we talk about Armin's glowup though? He finally looks and sounds male
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shinpachix,"I am not going to lie i feel for the warriors to the point that i want them to win or at least survive.

Eren and friends are brutes real ‚Äúdevils‚Äù"
Shinpachix,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,"Yeah unpopular opinion I'm rooting for the Warriors.

I like their characters better for one and personally I do not trust Eren at all at this point. He is becoming too unstoppable for his own good and all this talk about destroying his enemies, the fact he has no remorse for killing innocent Eldians (his own people ffs), and that (from whats been hinted) his own friends are nervous about him makes me think hes headed down a dark path of revenge.

So even though Marley are evil I don't feel their evil is unstoppable like Eren so I want them to put him in check if that makes sense."
Shinpachix,TDEthemafiaofthewest,"Idk, bc just a few episodes ago, all those warriors didn‚Äôt mind committing genocide and destroying an entire island of people. Propaganda or not there‚Äôs not really any good guys in this story."
TDEthemafiaofthewest,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,"Tbf even though what they did was obviously evil Annie, Reiner, and Bert were literally just brainwashed kids who were forced to attack the island under the threat of death (based off of Reiner's comments that they would be killed if they went back empty handed). They also obviously felt intense guilt over what they did.

Compare that to Eren who is now like 20 (still young but definitely in better shape to determine right from wrong compared to 12 year olds) has seen what war does to kids and just decides anyway to blow up a whole apartment building full of his own people and go on a mass killing spree. 

I mean I see why Eren feels he has to strike first to defend himself and all but the way he is going about it is so reckless and wrong I think its becoming increasingly obvious (especially based of Mikasa's comments) hes going down a very dark path. Which is why I am rooting for the warriors to stop him before he becomes simply too powerful."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,espectro11,"Hold up guys..... You guys have probably seen the theory or think that Zeke may not be dead ( since we didn't really see him die). A comment mentions how Zeke may be a traitor and how Eren gets a baseball glove. You may say, why are you just repeating what other posts say? Well I've got another theory that may be supported by those other theories.

What is it? Well if Zeke really isn't dead and it's working with the scouts he may also get eaten by Eren, how?!, Well think back to the baseball glove scene, it has nothing to do with Zeke, the beast titan is best known for its throwing abilities so Eren having a baseball and a glove means he's trying to get better at throwing and in case he does eat Zeke he won't have to learn how to throw in case the time comes where he needs to use the beat titan. 

Why would Zeke want to get eaten? He has a year left is he is really betraying Marley he has to get eaten by someone from paradis and why not by his own brother?  its perfect foreshadowing!



HUGE EDIT!!!: it all makes perfect sense!!! What if by eating Zeke, Eren is able to use the FOUNDING titan!!! Since Zeke has royal blood and Eren eats him he technically has royal blood ""flowing"" through him!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Treshle,"I know part of what this season is trying to show is how our heroes are now the monsters and that revenge is bad, blah blah but is anyone actually rooting for Marley/the Eldians?? The show is trying it's darndest to make us care about some of them but I honestly just want them all to get eaten. The kids, the soldiers, don't care. Get digested ye cunts. That's what you get for being nazis and instigating this shit ü§£"
Treshle,iFluvio,"Yeah rewatch S1, especially the 57th exposition, knowing that it's all Marley's doing. 

And the burning hatred for Marley comes back. 

I like all the titan shifters. But seeing Armin nuke Liberio, seeing Zeke, Pieck and Porco get their shit kicked in was phenomenal."
Treshle,Treshle,I guess two people are Marley sympathizers
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,massi1008,"Reiners new look is neat. Even though he want's to die, he still developed some advancements to his titan (if that is how it works, idk)."
massi1008,Former_Sea,People are saying it‚Äôs his titan transforming partially. So it‚Äôs not a random power up luckily
Former_Sea,aheze,Yeah it definitely is. His face has so much less armor on it. Not surprising with his depression tho
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,derpatron13,We not gonna talk about Reiner and his new titan form
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tanookiben,"The preview for the next episode starts with something about how >!the Armored Titan falls!<, doesn't that spoil the next episode?

Does that mean >!Reiner will lose against Eren (if not also get eaten)!<?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,classroom_dumbass,"I love how this whole season humanized the ""villains"" and dehumanized the ""heroes"" of the whole thing. Like, you know that Marley had it coming but you can't help but feel just a bit of sadness for them and just a bit of spite for the ""good"" side"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,about30hours,"People are talking about ""Screw the Marleyans. They get what they deserve"" but most of the deaths aren't Marleyans. The whole battle is taking place in the Eldian Internment Zone. The Navy grunts are mostly Eldians and from conquered territories outside Marley. 

Great episode though. The weight on Armin was really heavy. I don't think Zeke is dead (this show never passed up an opportunity to show someone dying violently).

Still, Willy's plan seems to be going well. The world outside Marley will likely start to demonize Paridis Island and they have much more advanced weapons than Marley."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,masterstealth11,"Downvote me, ignore me, whatever, but I just want to put my opinion in the history book.

I am not rooting for Eren‚Äôs side. Yes, we got 3 seasons of Eren and the gang fighting titans and struggling to survive. And I loved it. They were innocent people facing an almost impossible threat and trying their best to survive.

But now they‚Äôre just committing the same evil onto more innocent people. Yes, the Marleyan government is evil. But are MARLIANS evil? Just like Eren and the gang before they found the basement, Marlians only have the information they‚Äôve been given. They genuinely thought Paradis was full of evil people. Willy‚Äôs story was a revelation for them. They are just normal people put in a situation where they didn‚Äôt have a choice to pick sides, just like Paradis Eldians.

So what makes it ok for Eren and the gang to murder hundreds of them? Nothing. If anything, it‚Äôs worse, because they have more information than the everyday Marlian. They knew that the Marlian government was evil, but that Marlians didn‚Äôt really know what was going on.

So, I just can‚Äôt root for Eren. He is not a ‚Äúgood‚Äù guy anymore. If anything, he‚Äôs ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù"
masterstealth11,joalesup,"At the same time, if the warriors from Paradis Island did nothing, they would be slaughtered. Marley caused this to happen by attacking them in the first place. They could either wait to be murdered or fight for their freedom in a war Marley started."
joalesup,Badalight,"If that were the case, Eren should have attacked before all of the world leaders gathered. He created an enemy out of the entire world rather than just having Marley as an enemy. 

Also, the argument of ""they started it first"" doesn't even make sense because Eldia was the country that slaughtered Marleyans. The only reason Marley exists as a country right now is because King Fritz and the Tybur family betrayed Eldia."
masterstealth11,Zazzaro703,"If they don‚Äôt do anything though they will be slaughtered. Marlians want the founding titan AND the resources underneath Paradis city. Eren didn‚Äôt attack until war was declared. War is ugly and has casualties, that‚Äôs just the way it goes. They attacked when they knew all the titans would be there and would have the best chance to eliminate as many of them as they could as well as their military. They wiped out their leaders and their navy."
Zazzaro703,Badalight,"I think you missed some information. Eren was not ""waiting until war was declared."" He could care less about that. His plan was to kill a bunch of world leaders and turn the world into his enemy. If you are a fan of Paradis, you should disagree with Eren's plan. Why? Because now the entire world is against Paradis when it was only Marley before. Sure, Tybur's story might have gotten them a few ally nations, but Tybur himself said it would be a tough sell because Marley has too many enemies and has been in too many wars.

Eren turned a big problem into a massive one. If Eren's plan was simply to beat Marley or get revenge on them, he would have attacked them at literally any other point before the world leaders gathered."
masterstealth11,kelsier69,"The entire rest of the world was about to gang up on his island, he said himself he didn't have a choice since he's trying to defend his people."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,darkmarineblue,"Man, a lot of people in this community sure like to defend the killing of civilians..."
darkmarineblue,illumantimess,Kinda backing up some of the points this show is making about how anger stemming from war crimes can lead to support for senseless violence against civilians. A cruel cycle
illumantimess,Twindo,"This. I was horrified and disgusted with what Marley did to eldians of the island and of Marley itself. The violence, killing, death, it was all very sad. I can‚Äôt feel terrible for the innocent islanders dying while feeling joyful that the innocent Marleylans are dying in the same way. It just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Violence truly is cyclical."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,capedcrusader97,"99% sure Zeke isn't dead, but has instead betrayed Marley and is working with the Paradesian forces. We know there are Eldians within Marley who've been working with the Paradesians, and I'm pretty sure they've been dropping hints that at least one of the Warriors is a traitor to Marley. We haven't seen what happened to Zeke after he was lured away, which implies to me that he wasn't lured away at all - he was meeting up with other Paradesian forces. As far as I remember, we didn't actually see him kill anyone the whole episode - he threw some rocks, but nobody actually died. He didn't even really try to fight Eren. I'm pretty sure Levi didn't kill him, he was extracting him to get him on the zeppelin. Threw down that bomb to create smoke cover so the Marleyan forces wouldn't know what's going on - I think they want the Marleyans to think Zeke is dead."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GroundbreakingSort32,"For everyone discussing if zeke is actually on paradis side.. it has now become clear that armin was not the bearded soldier that led pieck and Porco to the trap door room. And also zeke was MIA when the attack started, he just casually strolls over once the fighting had been going on. Where was this goon? Could it be that he disguised himself and tried to protect porco and pieck while also taking them out of the battle because he knew what was about to go down? Also he would probably be one of the only ones who was aware of that trap door room clearly built for titans. There‚Äôs no way eren and the gang could have built that or discovered it.

That‚Äôs my vote! It was zeke who led them away and shaved his beard + lowered his helmet  and disguised his voice so they wouldn‚Äôt recognize him."
GroundbreakingSort32,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,"No that doesn't work because they literally ran into Zeke on the way to the trap. The mysterious soldier told Zeke that the command wanted to speak to him or something like that, that was what drew him away."
Spokane_Lone_Wolf,GroundbreakingSort32,Oh damn maybe I need to rewatch I thought I was onto something lol. So where was zeke when the attack began?
GroundbreakingSort32,JooK8,"Zeke was literally walking with them and the bearded Soldier.  For whatever reason Zeke was told to go to the front gate, while Pieck and Porco were lead into the trap."
JooK8,GroundbreakingSort32,Yet I‚Äôm a dumb dumb
GroundbreakingSort32,hrdp453,"You're forgetting that the bearded soldier also told Zeke to go the other way alone. They both were in the same shot, they're obviously 2 different people."
hrdp453,GroundbreakingSort32,Hey man I‚Äôm already wallowing in my stupidity see the above comments
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RelicHunter2000,Why doesn‚Äôt Zeke just turn all the scouts into titans and control them? Why doesn‚Äôt he just convert Levi into a Titan ?
RelicHunter2000,Samuraiworld,Titans need eldians plus spinal fluid. Zeke can‚Äôt conjure them out of nothing. He just has dosed up people in the past and can exercise some control.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bookinreview,"I made a post regarding my review on episode 7 of aot season 4 but this subreddit is not allowing me to write a post and saying that flair is wrong.
Please someone help me and if you want to help, please check out the review here. I really don't like this type of spam but this subreddit left me with no option
https://youtu.be/2tkuIVi_Zqk"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VishVarm,Uhh did Levi die with Zeke?
VishVarm,jbere75,Don‚Äôt think so. He was standing on top of zekes fallen body. Guessing zeke is just knocked out and not actually dead tho
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ali-BB,"Please someone reply
Am I just dumb or did Levi blow himself up?
Like idk I just saw it like that
He‚Äôs probably my fav or 2nd fav character in the series and him dying would be another huge blow to me lol
Just watched the first 3 seasons and episode 1-6 in the last 3 days
All these deaths destroyed me lol"
Ali-BB,as122000,"It looked like he did, but it‚Äôs Levi, so he probably used his gear to zip line outta there last second after setting off the grenade"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vanillafox69,Wait did Levi blow himself up?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrHikigaya,Quick question. Who are we supposed to root for?
DrHikigaya,Treshle,My thoughts exactly. Find my comment for more thoughts üòÇ
DrHikigaya,masterstealth11,Completely agree with you. It‚Äôs really hard because the people we have been supporting for 3 seasons are doing the same evil things that were done to them
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,turbokat123,"r/unpopularopinion

Im really starting to miss the previous animation style now üò≠
The camera movements and fight scenes used to look more glorious and intense. 

I could feel some of the scenes that were in this episode that would have literally made me jump out of my seat but they weren't animated with those kind of movements and pans while at some point the movements lacked the detail of micro movements with Maneuver gear."
turbokat123,Urgfsfav_redditor,Stfu thinking this is an unpopular opinion lol. Animation is literally the main gripe people have with this season. Guess what tho? You‚Äôll survive.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reh_interlude6713,"I just love how i am coming here after every episode to see how people reacted when it all went down live.  
this brings me to its funny how they think that scouts and island people cant win a real war against them and moments later 10 of them just took out the whole city. i wish these people could see how they literally breathe in killing the titans. from the moment they were born, this is their life. they were not able to sit peacefully bc shit is always going down somewhere."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,spuhgetee,Did anyone else notice the ‚Äúblood particles‚Äù of the War Hammer titan in the blood of the Jaw titan as well?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lv4_squirtle,"Do not care one bit about Gabbi. What a pointless character to add to already huge cast.

Edit: somebody pm'd me spoilers, guess they were butt hurt about this comment. News flash, I've read the manga. :)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HKMachine,"So many damn questions. How did Levi get up to the Beast's neck? Is Zeke dead? Did Levi ackbar? Did Eren absorb the War Hammer? Did the Jaw? Or is it just lost to another? Will Gabi ever fire? 

Sasha's hunting skills on point. Add ODM gear and you get a Widowmaker. 

The whole cast on both sides was great. A couple Reverses but only one typical episodic cliffhanger at the end."
HKMachine,Treshle,"Rule 1: if we don't absolutely, definitely see them die, they are _not_ dead."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DerpyInsight,Anyone else appreciate how Pieck's guns straight up make people explode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StaleToasts,I'm one of the ones who kinda found last episodes CGI to be jarring but damn this episode was GORGEOUS!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Disorder79,"Honestly, the next episode preview has me worried with Gabi on the airship that Hange and Armin are on. And the next episode is called ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Bullet‚Äù makes me think that we are gonna lose someone next episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,darkdude103,This episode made me feel so many feelings
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wishyfishy,"I think the first few episodes of this season were meant to make me feel sympathetic towards Marley and the Eldians and think that there is no right and wrong in war, and that there are innocents on both sides, but I honestly don‚Äôt feel that way. I feel next to zero sympathy for Marley and the brainwashed Eldians that fight for them. I know Gabi is meant to be an Eldian callback to young, vengeful Eren, but I honestly just hate her for how naive she is. Hope Eren crushes them all."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrLumpkin420,Now that eren has eaten the war hammer does that mean he has the power of two titans?
MrLumpkin420,jarhead839,"Three. Attack, war hammer, and founding."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,afcc1313,So Eren did really eat Warhammer Titan? We don't actually see her enter the mouth so I'm scared they will pull a twist
afcc1313,BrianDawkins,He only needs to eat the spinal fluid.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Practicalaviationcat,"Man I've watched the scene of Pieck and the Panzer squad getting destroyed so many times. I don't even even hate those characters or anything, but seeing the scouts wreck them is just so satisfying."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bananana1994,"I can‚Äôt believe how fast this episode finished! I liked the action, kinda hated the cgi but really appreciated that they didn‚Äôt animate the colossal titan with it. The part where Eren used jaw titan to chew on the warhammer, I wish they could have added some facial expression on Tybur‚Äôs face. She seems like ‚Äúyeah, whatever, I guess I‚Äôll die‚Äù"
bananana1994,shady_bananas,Don't think she could physically make any besides her eyeball movement
shady_bananas,bananana1994,"I‚Äôm pretty sure she can move the eyes. I mean, i didn‚Äôt expect her to scream or anything, just a bit of terror in her eyes. But what you‚Äôre saying is also a good point"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ErrdYavorsky,"This may be too early to say because I haven‚Äôt seen the pay off yet, but Gabi‚Äôs character is just dog shit awful. In an otherwise perfect show where characters are written phenomenally you have this girl whose presence so far has no place. I get that this is becoming a big anti-war piece, and she is probably going to exemplify how war just creates a cycle of tragedy which pushes people to be evil, but for now she‚Äôs just a girl with plot armor that is going to either kill someone important or inherit one of the Titans. As a viewer, you watch her scenes and just think oh man, is this going to be when she kills someone. On top of that, it has never been a question of if she is actually in danger. 

Anyway good episode CANT wait to see what Reiner is about to do"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mega__lul,I just realized the website I‚Äôm watching s4 on that  releases the episodes earlier has shit quality smh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,throwthatstuffaway07,wait cant the little kids eat those other injured marley titans? I feel like they should have done that
throwthatstuffaway07,LlamaLegacy,they haven't been properly chosen as successors plus they have to be a pure titan to eat them
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ninjaish_official,Do you guys think levi died when he blew up zeke?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,onlyforshadyshit,JC how do you guys rate this one? Felt meh to me but then again Im numb after watching my team get bodied in the NFC championship...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WirelessShit,"Am I the only person who can't believe Zeke is dead, the way warhammer died so fast was boring too, sasha (I believe) was amazing. He only problem I'm having is that I can't recognize the characters with the new design."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,remmon22,"Oops sorry about that, I was half asleep when I replied."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,abhortor,How was Eren able to transform while being underground/ indoors without sunlight?
abhortor,Twindo,Titan shifters don‚Äôt need sunlight to function at their best like pure Titans
abhortor,iFluvio,"It's not about the size of space, it's about whether the titan can force it's way out. 

Eren only had a building holding him, so.pushing out would be easy.

But the hole that Pieck and Porco were trapped in was far too deep and it's hard rock on all sides. Would make it impossible for their titans to push outward."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sapstic,istg the monke titan didnt do shit why was he just standing there and not doing his baseball shenanigans lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,keykeydoyouloveme,Porco definitely got some War Hammer Titan power now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ogreknee,"Making me cheer for the ""bad guys"" feel bad for the eldians and want paradis to fall wtf...lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,momu1990,"I hate to say it but I'm disappointed by the animation quality for the fight sequences. WIT animation is definitely better for fast paced action sequences, especially those very refined MMA (creator is a big MMA fan) fight sequences between Eren vs Reiner and Eren vs Annie in the previous seasons. 

I just felt like all the fast paced action in this episode was very blurry and not as crisp. Beggars can't be choosers I guess, but man would it have been a dream if WIT stayed for the final season :("
momu1990,espectro11,"Fair point but you gotta realize MAPPA had 10 months to make this anime, WIT had 3 or more years to hand draw the whole season. The animation is very freaking good if you think about how long they had"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Derionn,"I'm scared that porco might have eaten the warhammer titan instead of eren. He used his jaw after all, and I don't know if blood counts as the body."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,blackshark99,"There was an over reliance of Cgi in this episode. And it looked bad,especially when eren killed the warhammer titan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shaft_king,Porco ate Warhammer? Holy shit!
shaft_king,That1asianboy420,"No,eren did"
That1asianboy420,shaft_king,We'll see next week.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CipherZer0,I think the pacing in this episode was terrible. Just when something was about to go down they'd change the scene and show some irrelevant shit. Also I remember this fight being a lot more detailed and bigger in the manga.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HarryDJ4,Aww man... this weeks episode looked much worse than last weeks in my opinion. Some of those music choices where incredible bad that Armin transformation.... a lot of scenes lacked so much impact. Or after Pieck got blasted and ran over the roofs loocked really bad. I hope future episodes will look better but i beginn to doubt that....
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Guinness6969,"Awesome ep but I wish they expanded more on Zeke cuz Levi took him out like an absolute badass although they didn‚Äôt show him dead so who knows. But I rlly wanna see how Zeke interacts w Eren when he finds out they‚Äôre half brothers. We never know how Zeke handled basically killing his parents by snitching on them, so maybe he feels guilt? Or it could be the opposite and if he still hates his dad he could use that hate against eren. Also, does eren know the Beast titan is Zeke already? He knows who Zeke is but idk if the knows that he is the beast titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"ok.. so I have a theory I mentioned on last week's podcast (link in profile) that i THINK is reinforced by this episode. Preface: i'm an anime only watcher, and I'm guessing other people have thought of this already too, but:

I think Eren's goal is to eat ALL of the titans (he now has 3: founding, attack + war hammer) so that he can control all 9.. But not for military superiority, but so that he can eliminate titan control and hand down the curse of the titans in order to remove their existence from the earth for the benefit of humanity. he was inches from taking Galliard in this episode, too.

Of course, him not going for Beast or Cart (and Beast seemingly being killed) this episode might poke holes in this... and maybe there are more holes I'm not thinking of cause I'm still buzzing from this episode... but i don't know. seems like it might fit.

Thoughts?

(the podcast mentioned above is an AoT weekly episode discussion, pls feel free to check it out)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JGuilherme02,Whats up with the preview for next episode? Why are they ganging up on Eren?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aj12wedf,Can we talk about Reiners new Armour Titan? Has it been upgraded or downgraded? Plus is he gonna win against Eren? I think this rounds gonna be different when compared to the rest..
aj12wedf,Clumulus,"Looks like more of a downgrade. It's said multiple times in the ep and previously that Reiner basically have no will to live. There's also less armor covering him, looks like an incomplete transformation."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SPI-vot,Just amazing.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Drangonef,"I thought this would be an even fight but damn marley didn't stand a chance against my boys.
Great episode I love everything, I don't get why mappa is getting so much hate."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Maame_lade,"I was really expecting some sort of sibling interaction between Eren and Zeke like

""Yo, we got the same dad""
""Yeah I know right, mega cool""

 I can't believe that nobody's gonna find out Zeke has royal blood or his connection to Eren through his memories. Now that he's dead, I dont think anyone's care enough to find out so that's kinda a shame but I trust Isayama's plot-making skills so imma just wait patiently üßéüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hampamatta,so the colossal titan got a buff? that nuke was hella lot bigger than bertholdt's nuke in Shiganshina District.
Hampamatta,taskkill-IM,"I just assumed because of the warships, the mixture of high temp with mass amount of oil and gunpowder just made it on a nuclear level...

Either that or Bertholdt was just holding back all this time.... Armin is just badass."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mundotaku,"Me last Sunday: LOL, Porko got owned badly, probably they will save his ass next episode. I cannot get worse for him.

[Eren this Sunday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKcZL8q1eBw)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Digis7,"Shoutout to the animation, was really good this time around, no iffy moments like some in the last episode. Even that one scene with Eren holding Galiard's head, his head movement is a bit weird, but it fit nicely adding up the creepiness of seeing a demon using you as a nutcracker."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,skyrule,Wait does this mean Eren can now use the War Hammer titan's powers too???
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Strict_Reputation_27,"1. How did the Beast Titan just fall from one slash from Levi?

2. How did Pieck survive that fight when the Panzer Unit was being bombarded with thunder spears? She should of died in the explosion from the looks of it.

3. How did Mikasa just slice off the Jaw Titan‚Äôs legs like it was nothing?

4. Eren didn‚Äôt hesitate to eat the Warhammer Titan so I don‚Äôt understand why Eren didn‚Äôt just eat Galliard there. He had more than enough time to consume him before Reiner would of attacked him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Retarded4yearold,I rly hope to hear youseebiggirl or Vogel im kafig at least once this season
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Owl_Szn,Is Zeke definitely done?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DoktorSleepless,What if the Jaw Titan also drank some of that spinal fluid?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,adamkorhan123,What was up with Reiners titan face changing?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ANINETEEN,Marley literally facing their own devils. Can't win against the monsters literally engineeried and dedicated to destroying you
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wulfgar830,"Did levi just Suicide bomb? Why didn't Erin use the war titians power right away. Its so hard not to look this up but thats the fun waiting for the next epsoide to come out. It would be cool if the Manga fans, could post side stories thats going on in the last epsoides. Or like more information that they didn't explain thoroughly. Like when Annie was following Kenny. More info like that."
Wulfgar830,LlamaLegacy,"> Why didn't Erin use the war titians power right away

i'm guessing because he didn't know how or he didn't want to risk it 

> Like when Annie was following Kenny. More info like that.
The anime unfortunately skipped the explanation for why she was following him: she wanted to follow one of the guards because she thought it might lead her to the king of the walls"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Axiser,"Armin is shorter than hange in the aircraft scene and as i said before i think the tall soldier is a female because she had eyelashes, i think the tall soldier is the blonde in odm gear because they focus on her in many scenes"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrBlqckBird242,Eren made galliard his bitch. He stripped that fool of all his limb and went *here goes the nut cracker*
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DanteVSTheWorld,"*I'm from Paradis and I say KILL 'EM ALL*

Fuck 'em, hope Zeeke is dead too for acting so cocky last season, killing those scouts, now look at him, little bitch got rekt twice now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sheamurp,"Omg this episode was absolutely crazy, another amazing episode and my god another episode that felt like 2 minutes. That entrance from Armin was insane and seeing Hange as well was so damn good. Levi, Mikasa, and Eren all kicking ass and now it seems Eren will have the Warhammer Titans ability hopefully. Holy crap I can‚Äôt wait for next week again Attack on Titan has me saying this every week Wow."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Goulartinhow,"If the soldier who took Pieck and Porco to the well on EP5 wasn't Armin, who was he? Is he related to Zeke?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ben800m,Lmao eren is going to be so op after eating those 2 and i also think that big monke boy is alive and he‚Äôll consume him too to become god
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainSmeg,This is the best show i‚Äôve ever watched. I‚Äôve never watched anything where I‚Äôm hyped and on the edge of my seat every week.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirSpits,"I‚Äôm not a manga reader so if I‚Äôm correct about what I‚Äôm about to say and you know I‚Äôm correct don‚Äôt tell me, but I think Zeke is a double agent. 

1. He mentioned to Levi about running out of time like he knew about the escape plan. 
2. He wasn‚Äôt locked away in the hole with P&P
3. Eren had a baseball and glove a few episodes ago which is an obvious connection to Zeke"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,K-E-E-F,Why is reiner a lightskin now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Former_Sea,"So, I want to ask what was Eren doing past years? Dude transformed to titan not once but 3 times in a short time. He must have been hitting the gym very hard I assume."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PNDLivewire,"Damn, Armin got a bigger kill count in 10 seconds than everybody else combined, Eren included got in the whole fight so far.

Also, seeing Porco get messed up was strangely cathartic for some reason."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BboyonReddit,"This episode was a ride. How did the survey corps get the airship? If they had airship technology they would've used it earlier. Did they independently develop it or steal one? Or was their an insider who helped them? Some people brought up zeke potentially being a restorationist, but maybe Erens letters had a plan?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,1kSuns,"Holy shit.... I mean, what else can you say?

The art direction is just incredible."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Burrito119,"I think the thing that stuck out to me the most about this episode was Reiner's transformation at the end. Considering his state before hand, it seemed to me as if he had transformed his own body into the Armored Titan rather than creating the body around himself. He certainly seems to have a death wish so I wonder if he's committing suicide by Titan here"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,turtlintime,"So can eren ever transfer the individual titan powers to other people now without dying or will it forever be like 3 titan powers in one if you kill him?

I still genuinely don't know which side to root for"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ImSquizzy,I really hope they explain why eren has become such a heartless monster now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,unixverese,armin hot
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Atreya95,Didn't the Armored Titan look different in the end?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,spyke333,"I still don't know whether I want the Reiner, Gabi and the gang to die or not. Why do manga creators always have to play with humanity and toy with our emotions like this? Why couldn't the Titans just be monsters Eren had to kill and not child soldiers living in internment camps trying to fight their way to freedom? 
That being said, I wouldn't want it any other way."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IITomTheBombII,God damn Eren was taking his time to eat Porco
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BasedRomo,Why couldn‚Äôt armin just nuke everyone during the play!? That would‚Äôve been so much simpler than Erens surprise attack.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IVIabil,Ackermans are too strong
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sarazan97,"One of the things that seemed inconsistent is the comparison between Porco's jaw titan form and ymir's. Armin gets the colossal titan appearence, even if his first titan form before eating berthold wasn't special. Ymir though maintains the same titan form before and after eating Porco's brother, she looks the same"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rumed01,"Ok but why did Eren take sooo long to smash galliard's face in just to decide to bit the nape just as Reiner was transforming... Seemed like Eren was messing around, was kinda annoying"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bdoya66,Bro this episode was Sick. Fucking armin‚Äôs colossal titan was epic. Eren Violated the fuck out of porco
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,senato27,"I honesly need to know if somebody died, cause like porco didn‚Äôt pieck didn‚Äôt and we don‚Äôt see zeke dead so idk anymore, what do u guys think?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AJbeast01,"Who the fuck is supposed to be the antagonist now... cause all the Marleyan Titans appear defeatable. We have seen 8 out of the 9 Titans now, and the female titan isn‚Äôt of any significance imo. Obviously there‚Äôs the ‚ÄúPok√©mon collecting‚Äù theme of Eren potentially uniting the Titans, but who is the ultimate enemy? Is it going to be like Naruto where Madara / Kaguya comes out of history to become the world ending antagonist?"
AJbeast01,LlamaLegacy,"there is no ""ultimate enemy"". both sides are fighting each other to the death because that's who they think their enemies are. For Marley, Eren is the ultmate enemy but for Paradis, the whole world is their enemy"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,alpha-123,The warhammer died im not happy :(
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justaverage00,does anyone else think the Warhammer titan wasn't actually eaten. It looks like Eren just swallowed her in the same way the mindless titan swallowed eren in season 1
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OldBirth,"I'm guessing Eren has 'infinite transformations' because he has multiple Titans 'in him?' Seems like the most OP Titan Power there is. 

Levi vs Zeke was hella anticlimactic. I literally said out loud 'it's happening!' at the cold open then Zeke just...dies. It was weird. I keep imagining an alternate scenario where Zeke gets misdirected by Armin and Levi slices him up on some empty street while he's still in human form. I thought Titans getting killed not eaten was gonna be a thing but oh well. 

AWESOME episode besides. I love this fucking season so much! So far this is the best final season of any show since Breaking Bad."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mishamaro,"I get all the Zeke is a Double agent rationale but like..... Nofucking way Levi could swallow what happened when they took back Shingashina, when Beast Titan massacred EVERYONE and Erwin. I honestly can't buy that Levi could declare truce with Zeke. Like..... They're gonna have to explain that MASSIVELY away for me to accept that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,creator200711,one thing i don't get hows does the titan stacking work does eren have the combind power of war hammer attack and founder or only 1
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ghostwolf1234,I got to the party a bit late but from some of the comments under this episode we crashed the crunchyroll servers
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dillydilly3500,Does anybody know why Reiners Titan form looked so different than it normally does at the end ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flaming_james,"Did Levi just kill himself to take out the Zeke? I replayed the moment a bunch of times and he looks caught off guard when he sees Gabi and Falco, Gabi screams, and the explosion happens and we never see Levi leave and there's no ODM sound..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,samirx96,"Out of all titan shifters, Reiner will def give Eren a fight. Can‚Äôt wait for next week"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bobosquishythe1,"Is it just me or did the build up of the war hammers appearance and hype of the fight sort of just end very abruptly with eren saying ""Ok no more play fighting"" and then just inherited it. Gat dayum"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,metronobody,"Who else cheered when Levi took down the beast titan? My brother and I, both in our 20‚Äôs, were out of our seats whooping and hollering. I loved seeing Hange show up in the blimp, I really hope we get a chance to slow down and catch up with the team from paradis (hopefully we don‚Äôt lose anyone before that). Also any guesses about the origins of the pilot of the blimp?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dontdodispls,why did zeke say Levi was running out of time?
dontdodispls,max1001,"Because they planned for this.  They had the naval ships coming to surround the city as well as the troops that were training the in mountain.  Remember, this was supposed to be a trap for Eren and the corps."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jgasparino44,Yo wait hold up Zeke ain't dead I thought he was but I just remembered Zeke is royal blood and Eren needs royal blood to fully activate the founding titan. Was levi just watching the clock waiting for the ship so that he could get away with Zeke before they realize?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Scompy,"Since Eren ate another Titan, does that mean his lifespan was extended again? Hmm"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rawandmayi,This anime seriously not a matter of evil and hero good or bad both sides are fighting for what they think is true and both are fighting to the death honestly this show is just amazingly a masterpiece
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ferraaa,When it cut to the ending I couldn‚Äôt believe it was over. I had to check that this was a full 20 minute episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AzusaWorshipper,Animation was super improved here. I mentally prepared myself for episode 6 level animations but Mappa slaps me cross the face
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Two_Watermelons,This has to be one of the most brutal episodes we've had in a long time
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mctravie,"Wouldn‚Äôt some of the blood of war hammer get swallowed by Jaws too, will he get a power up too?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VagabondRommel,"The part where Eren uses the jaw titan to kill the war hammer titan cracked me up because whenever it showed Eren's titan with it's mouth open I kept imagining him saying, ""say ahh"" to the jaw titan. A ridiculous image, and a pretty good episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yessirbuddymanguybro,"If Eren just uses the Jaw's body to break the crystal, wouldn't the amount of force on the crystal be equal to Eren's strength? It's not like the Jaw is using his superior jaw strength to bite into the crystal. He's just being forced by Eren's hands. It's like using a nutcracker."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pineapple_is_Gud,"No cap when Reiner showed up at the end, I damn near cried."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meanteenbirder,"Just curious, couldn‚Äôt Eren have screwed up the angle that the crystal was broken and Porco could‚Äôve gotten the Warhammer Titian?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThunderBow98,"Ok can someone just refresh me on this one detail: 

Why does Marley choose to attack Paradis and launch the warrior operation to take the Founding Titan? As far as they‚Äôre concerned, the king will unleash the wall titans if Paradis is attacked, it‚Äôs basically mutually assured destruction."
ThunderBow98,Changlini,"They specifically said they got intel that Eren took the founding titan away from the king, during the war declaration, so it's safe to presume that...

&#x200B;

Well: The most important thing about all of this is that the War Declaration is a last gasp attempt for Marley and the Je-er--Devils to get the world on their side to tackle a singular threat while also giving the nation time to tech-up into better military technology in order to avoid annihilation from the pissed off nations they keep oppressing with Titans.

But yeah: Marley knew what was going on in Paradise island, thanks to the children soldiers they sent."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eatyourmomdotcom,There‚Äôs no way zeke dies from that bomb but like how tf does he survive it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,samgo88,I want good Eren not brutal Eren :(
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Busy-Ad-5167,Armin still seems to bear the guilt of being alive instead of Erwin. Hangs asked if Erwins ghost possessed him. Is Armin trying to make up for what happened 4 years ago?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MapleButterBear,Hold up how was armins 6'7 ass shorter than Hange in the blimp scene?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,peytonieus,did levi really blow up with the beast titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jbauer777,"I know they gotta hype it with constant cliffhangers and reversals but does anyone else just want the ultra cathartic version where the scouts just swoop in and wreck everyone. Slowest chomp in the world from our boy Eren this week and I'm guessing Zeke survives somehow.

Probably not the best storytelling to go that route but if any show earns it, it's probably AoT; we get shit on for 3 seasons and then come in and wreck shop. You could still have all the conflict around perspective and genocide v genocide. I struggle seeing all these fake kills and uno reversal cards."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dombruhhh,Cart Titan talking is so fucking cursed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Za106,"Armin, Eren, and Levi all carried this entire episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Za106,"But quick question, since Eren ate the Way hammer Titan, would his life span increase back to 13 years, or will it stay the same?"
Za106,ClickingHCT,Stays the same
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kyotobasedgod,How de we know porco didn‚Äôt drink some of the war hammer blood too?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,onlytherac00n,HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT REINERS NEW TITAN. That thing looks like he just got a massive power boost and I'm so excited to see if there are any new abilities with it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hazaops," Jaw titan exists

 Eren: N U T C R A C K E R"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Exuhgen,"Man every episode is turned up to 11. I hope AoT inspires a lot of people in the industry. It‚Äôs so refreshing to have a climax of a story have an actual resolution, and have plot points and past actions matter. It makes it all feel so much more impactful."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hananahbanana27,"This episode was so good. I‚Äôm loving this season so far. What happened to Levi? He didn‚Äôt die, right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Crawford1492,"At this point, what chapter are we in the manga?"
Crawford1492,ClickingHCT,almost to the end of chapter 104
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Havefede1,Can someone please explain to me what chapter of the manga was shown in this episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cloud_Atla,"Now I‚Äôm curious. Does Eren now have the war hammer Titans power? Did he get enough blood to even transfer it? Did some blood spill into Porcos mouth? Will the war hammer power be like they said if an eldian just dies with the power, will it just go to another randomly born eldian? I‚Äôm so confused"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iammeandyouisyou,Eren was cold in ep man
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"Hooolllllyyyy shiiiiittt dude.  What a freaking action-packed episode.  Like wow.  No one can be disappointed in this episode.  Every character was going all out.

However, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in Zeke... like he threw two rocks, and then was easily cut down.  Seemed pretty lame for the main antagonist up till this season.  I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs not done though... that would be too lame."
aReasson,Griever114,You forgot failing and bring back Ymir to be summarily executed because he is a piece of shit.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ImmuneToBleach,"Question: do you guys think we'll see Annie again? It wouldn't be like the show to just leave that as a plot hole, but as far as we know she's just back home on Paradis Island.

Also, is Eren even able to eat the Female? I mean, it's called the Female for a reason so maybe it has to be wielded by a female character (Mikasa?)"
ImmuneToBleach,illumantimess,The fact they‚Äôve had Annie mentioned so many times send a clear signal they‚Äôll bring her back. It did feel like she was memoryholed last season
ImmuneToBleach,aReasson,I think they‚Äôll convince Annie to help them. She just wants to go home and she‚Äôs tired of everyone‚Äôs shit.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,puneeth_69,Why is no one taking about the weird armoured titan transformation?
puneeth_69,aReasson,People are thinking that it‚Äôs a weaker transformation. His depression or condition is preventing him from forming the entire armor. The preview also says that the Armored Titan is deafened so it makes sense.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Hahahah I told y‚Äôall. I knew they had help from the inside. Now I‚Äôm 100% sure that tall mysterious soldier from last episode was a Marleyan traitor.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,All I‚Äôm thinking now is that Eren will use the warhammer powers to get a new form in order to fight Reiner‚Äôs upgrade. Their battle is going to be legendary I‚Äôm so EXCITED!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rufio27,"Am I supposed to feel bad for Falco and Gabi, Gallird and Pieck? They were literally planning a genocide"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SourTomato1040,"Wtf even is the beast titans powers, is it just monke throw rock"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,So is the jaw Titan the most physically strongest Titan or is it‚Äôs claws and head made up of a material that‚Äôs just as hard as the warhammer crystal?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Golmax,"I don‚Äôt know how I feel about This season so far.   

  I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of huge time skips in anime and this is one I feel iffy about. The hole point was for Eren and the others to get ready and train but I hope they didn‚Äôt change to much for example Eren, the main character and the ‚Äúhero‚Äù we have been rooting for now seems num and kinda like a villain which I think would be a terrible outcome.  I just hope that eren still has emotions and a personality and that the people of paradis are still the good guys.  The first three seasons were absolutely amazing, I just hope this one is even better"
Golmax,Badalight,"Eren is definitely feeling like a ""villain"" but what I love about his character is that his personality really hasn't changed. This has been foreshadowed since the beginning of the series. Remember back in one of the very first episodes how he brutally murdered the house intruders to save Mikasa? Mikasa made an off-handed comment back then that Eren's actions were not the actions of a normal child. He's always had anger issues - he just finds new places to direct them. At that time it was the house intruders. Then it was titans. Now it's Marley. He's always fought against people trying to take away his freedom.

But yes, his recent actions certainly are not morally just."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nanokye19,"This episode is crazy! Never expected Eren to get to that level of ruthlessness....
This is the culmination of racism; pure monstrosity. I guess I kind of ish understand why Eren has to do this but still it‚Äôs a lot. Seems like a lot of internal conflict is happening too with Jean, Armin & Mikasa so I feel like eventually they won‚Äôt be able to take this anymore or might back away from this type of thing. However they do support Eren and have his back so maybe they‚Äôll continue"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dongrizzly41,I havent read any manga but zeke turned eldians into titans in s4ep1when they were dropping from the plane. He also has been shown to be able to control titans in S2 and S3.
dongrizzly41,cgoodies5,I was assuming they were ejected before they hit the ground. Also he is a titan with royal blood so he is able to control pure Titans I believe
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cjjrock2,So are we all glossing over the fact that levi took a grenade to the face.........fuck happened to him???
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SenpaiBoomEd,Is it just me or Armored Titan got a new form?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,souaiway,can someone PLEASE tell me why Reiner is spiky at the end??? what the hell??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rody2k6,Hey guys after this episode where can we pick it up from in the mang√°?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Impractical1,"So now that eren ate the war hammer titan does that mean he gets the powers of the war hammer as well? If so that would be pretty bad ass, especially if he end ups eating multiple titans in the future."
Impractical1,kelsier69,"He should, that's what happened when his dad ate the Founding titan as the attack titan, both powers were in him and later Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Devoun,I think people are missing that we saw a few frames of Zeke in the season 4 trailer being carried by titans in a forest while being pursued by Levi. I highly doubt Zeke is dead since that scene hasn't popped up
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,browniebrittle44,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to make it with just one episode a week! I‚Äôm losing it!


Best show ever!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,boomstickah,"Levi was watching the time, he definitely had something going on with Zeke"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ToAsTyBoI-_-,Reiner looks like handsome squidward
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zaffro13,"I find it frustrating how the Titans are so hard to take down and yet when the Paradisans pull it off they fail to finish. Could have wiped out the armor and beast titan back in S3. And now they look like they may have let Cart, Jaw and Armor escape. 

Jaw was particularly frustrating because Eren just stops to turn around and look at Reiner instead of finishing the guy.

I hope Levi did kill Beast although a lot of the double agent theories seem likely. The only thing I‚Äôm going to need a really good explanation on is how any of the Scouts is willing to work with him after he wiped most of them out. Personally I hope that Levi did just end him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shIvAM_D12,the fight scenes were improved drastically
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Devoun,"Now that Eren has inherited the Warhammer titan, will he get their memories too?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,romanNood1es,Watching Eren drink the War Hammer Titan was oddly satisfying.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mordred_XIII,"Dude, this episode was just so fucking awesome. Even if I knew what was going to happen with Armin & The Collosal Titan, that scene when he transformed was amazing. I gotta be honest, though, I completely forgot what happened to the War Hammer Titan and was pleasantly surprised at that nut cracker scene (lol). And that last scene with Reiner appearing is just... Icing on top of an already amazing cake."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,boomstickah,"The brief cutaway scene while Gabi and Falco were yelling was to emphasize that Pieck died, right?"
boomstickah,cgoodies5,"I had the same thought, but I think in this case as in the case with zeke, unless they explicitly show someone dying of someone literally says they‚Äôre dead, probably best to assume they‚Äôre still alive"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Apocalypstick77,HOLY SHIT THAT WAS AMAZING
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meanteenbirder,Anyone else surprised that they didn‚Äôt make the Colossal Titan CG? I‚Äôm assuming this was because it was only visible up close for a short time.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoosySucker69,Eren - The Collector Titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bumchester,What's the caliber on those machine guns?!  The survey corp bodies were vaporized when they got hit! The marleyans warriors are really not used to loses when they lost that one machine gunner and then everything went to hell.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,i_am_da_1_who_knocks,Did Zeke die? Pls no manga spoilers. Am anime only
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vendaaiccultist,"This episode was phenomenal. I had minor beef with the last one, but this just redeems itself and blows it out of the park. Well fucking done."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chryowza,"So dope to see Eren cool, calm and composed. He doesn‚Äôt show any of that self doubt he‚Äôd been having previous sessions. Every misstep or hurdle that comes his way or literally through him, he assesses and responds. Don‚Äôt even get me started on how quickly he figured out what dat mouth do"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,likewhateveralready,"This episode was so good (I mean duh, this whole season has been amazing). Seeing Eren like this was so crazy and so cool. I feel like he has the same fiery rage but with more strategy and planning. Like he's able to hold off just long enough to go BIG CRAZY! I'm so excited to see what they have in store for us in the last season. We're truly eating."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sahil2921,"Armin saying same shit like Erwin omg!
and commander hange holy shit!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seahawksfan488,Why does Reiner look like that did he like evolve or something
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,akshaboi,"I honestly don't think Zeke got devoured with such ease.. I think he may have left his Titan shell.   
And damn. All of them being so worried about Levi beating the shit out of Beast Titan again really made me crack up.   
It's just so bizarre how Zeke says Eren Jaegar is no match for me but is worried about Levi kicking his ass"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zen1706,Any idea why the attack titan‚Äôs eyes are white now? Back then it was green
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UltimateDailga12,"Up until now, do we know/is it said if Reiner is the only one that can transfer his consciousness somewhere else in his body?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,War. War never changes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rayanator69,"This episode was brilliant. This is what we wanted for our scouts, right? -__- I felt sad watching the Warriors die like that. The Hammer Titan... I don't know if I'm even on a side anymore."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OldManJulian,Why is the black guy on the airship with the survey corps I thought he was with the tyburs and fucking died when eren transformed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,S_targaryen,"Armin really became Erwin Smith, huh?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ComicJester19,why did Reiner‚Äôs Titan look like that at the end?
ComicJester19,LlamaLegacy,Probably just tired/depressed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tyman2323,"Quick question, why did Zeke say Levi was rn unit out of time."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,albmrbo,So I finally caught up with the show. Can I just jump into where we are on the manga? Or do I have to read it from the start because the story diverges?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xyzwbtn,so like did levi suicide bombed the beast titan or did he odm away
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ChiCeti4,Eren is going full OP
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SpectralHaunter,did eren just transform 3 times? Wasn't he barely able to do only one before? Has he triggered some power with the royal blood he got from Willy or something?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seva2,how tf is reiner who transformed into this half ass armored titan and is tired and wants to die gonna beat eren who literally just ate the warhammer titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PurpleLightningart,I was surprised to see a black dude from paradis? The guy in the blimp with hange. I thought everyone in the walls were all white
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAMMIIRO,I wonder when the Eldians will finally all unite...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThePinoyShinobi,Doesn‚Äôt Porco get some residual spinal fluid from that nutcracker scene and are we 100% sure Zeke is dead or is it just implied?
ThePinoyShinobi,DeepFriedCabbage,"Eren was holding Porco by the neck, to stop him from swallowing. He was crushing his neck pretty much. Brutal"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,visual_overflow,"Armin used transform, it was super effective.

What an episode. This season is absolutely amazing and we aren't even half way through it yet! It truely is the glimmer of joy in these hard times."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,goForIt07,"Shouldn't Porco/Jaw Titan have inherited the War Hammer Titan before Eren? I mean, the blood did get in to Jaw Titan's mouth first and likely swallowed some before Eren"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,One_Ad5407,Did Levi die? I'm only wondering bcuz it looked like he blew himself up at the end there
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,miragewe,"is nobody gonna talk about how hot eren, mikados, armin- LITERALLY EVERYONE HAD SUCH A GLOW-UP!! I mean, excluding levi bc he never needed one"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justapotato9,"Too much awesomeness in one episode, I am living for eren‚Äôs yummy juice scene and our blonde boi is so OP he creates a fkin lava crater :‚Äô)

Does that mean the prev blonde guy who traps pieck and porco was annie? She sounds similar to him 

I wanna know what will happen to zeke since battle is too short he‚Äôs def not dead

Hope reiner‚Äôs battle ends asap since poor guy needs a break"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arthurb09,Can beast titan be eaten?  or we won't see that..   and what about the cart titan ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OneWingedAngelfan,"Season 1-3: Guys we need open up that basement!

Season 4: We need to open up the biggest can of whoop-ass the world has ever seen!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pritihelvete,HOW DID THEY MAKE ARMIN SO FUCKING HOT WTF?!?!?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gigi_1803,I really feel bad for Reiner. He was just a child who was filled with poison against the people in Paradis island and he didn't know any better and before he realised he was neck deep in his own shit. There was no going back for him. I truly believe he's innocent and has a good heart.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ticklish_Mango,"Do you guys think since Eren ate the War Hammer Titan, does he get another 13 years added to his lifespan? Along with getting the War Hammer‚Äôs abilities?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gigi_1803,Where does Eren Kruger mentioning Mikasa and Armin fit in? Eren definitely saw some future memories
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnimeFan36656,Beautiful episode and the colossal looked awesome
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BobbyWain,"I‚Äôm guessing from the guy flying the blimp that the Paridisians have been building alliances with Marley‚Äôs enemies, which may come in clutch when they attempt to retreat from Marley"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tacosbanos_inuranos,Why did levi hesitate when zeke says that hes out of time? Is levi dying?
tacosbanos_inuranos,tpat7270,"Just a guess, but i think Zeke is on Paradis' side. It seemed like Levi was timing his attack on Zeke with Armins transformation, but Zekes comment suggested that he knew the attack + transformation was coming.

idk how or when Zeke switched sides. But its strange how in an earlier episode, Zeke was coincidentally led away from the group before Pieck and Porco were trapped, plus Zekes  'you're out of time' comment. Plus the fact that Zeke is the only one with royal blood in Marley which Eren needs to use his founding titan power, making it toooo obvious that Zeke has some bigger role here"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SheuiPauChe,"Haven't read the manga so this is all speculation. That pilot of the airship was the first time we're seeing someone black on the side of the Islanders. Excluding the possibility that Isayama just forgot to write any in prior to S4, I'm guessing the Islanders got other countries to help them during the 4 years since they found out about the outside world"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,niko1611,Did the warhammer get eaten? I just saw blood dropping down
niko1611,taskkill-IM,"Yeah, basically crushed Warhammer titan and all you need is the spinal fluid to obtain the titan.... that's why it zoomed onto Erens eyes and they slightly changed.

Not sure how long the transition takes though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nerdy_Gem,Them turtlenecks on the new uniforms tho
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_darkwingduck_,"Getting real last of us 2 vibes with this story. Massive other side motives and context paralleled against the protagonists we‚Äôve known and loved longer.

The moral? Violence begets more violence, and in the realm of right versus wrong there‚Äôs nothing but shades of grey."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jheeeeeezzzzz,what chapter should i read now after watching ep7 (in moving onto the manga)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mighty__orbot,All I want for Christmas is a Jaw Titan Nutcracker.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bongowasd,"Dude I was so happy to see the Warhammer go down. Everyone else is just going to weasel their way out of this. Jesus, this whole season, despite the atrocities being committed has me feeling so vindicated and that's what's amazing about it. You can feel like they need to break the cycle etc. there is no good guy but god damn I love some karmatic justice. What was with Gabi at the end? Looks like she's with the Eren's crew, maybe monke titan is there too and talks her down or whatever. I still think he's trying to break the cycle and is actually with Erens group. Or maybe she goes back with them, or they explain that everything you've seen today is what Reiner did to us etc. So many scenarios, shits so amazing, I really hope we see whatever Eren saw when he ate the Warhammer too. Gad dang I gotta wait a whole week now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sandshaker,"This show is just fucking with my heart man... I'm pulling for eren...just give them a win they've been through so much shit. I understand marley has their own problems...but I been following eren this whole time, I want to see them happy."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skitz_Official,"Levi took zeke out way too fast, somethings up with that"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LennyChill,"I wanted to wait till the first half is completely out after the first episode.
Now I regret not being patient.
I'm an anime only with slightly manga spoilers and went completely nuts the last 3 episodes... and than episode 7 ended.
Damn you impatiens"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,abde71,"I really liked how they did levi vs zeke 2, or didn't do it. Because another fight the second time around wouldn't be nearly as epic so a short and sweet scene where levi just jumps him felt nice."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WMF1231,Oh YEAH BABBY!!! OUR MAIN HEROIN IS BACK TO SAVE THE DAY!! can't wait for the next episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Crosroad,So Annie is probably still alive if Eren couldnt break that Titan gem. Also we saw the war hammer user eyes moved while in the gem so they‚Äôre still conscious in that state
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DapperDaveW,"Anime only here, but I have a question about Zeke.  We know he can somehow turn Eldians into pure titans.  So couldn't he just use that power at any time to turns all the Scouts into pure titans (where they'd actually be less dangerous)?  Of course we don't know exactly how this power works yet so maybe the Eldians have to be willing."
DapperDaveW,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,Zeke can only turn Eldians that have been specifically injected with his Titan serum into Titans.
Spokane_Lone_Wolf,DapperDaveW,How would he have gotten that serum into all the Paradis village people he Titanized in season 2?
DapperDaveW,UnreflectiveEmployee,We didn‚Äôt see him do it live in Paradis and the ones in that attack on the fort looked fucked up or somehow pre-titaned or something.
DapperDaveW,JooK8,"Yeah there seems to be another step necessary for him to do it.  I don't think the condition would be that they have to be willing since I highly doubt Connie's village were willing participants.  

All the Eldians in the airship were also restrained and looked fucked up in some way, though they could have just been scared shitless.  I'm sure it'll be explained soon enough as I doubt Zeke is dead."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,apollothewallflower,"Anyone knows how Eren can transform into the Attack Titan multiple times? About three times now in one setting. Can he do it merely because of his perseverance and he had practice or is there something special about his titan that makes him able to do this? 

Anyway, this episode is so badass! Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,heartbreakhill,**NUTCRACKER TITAN BOOOOOIIIIIIIIII**
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Razor-kun,Hahaha so glad my prediction about Galliard becoming the Can Opener Titan came trueüòÇ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JOELISAW3SOME,I was wondering how many people Armin kills when he turns into the colossal titan compared to Bertholdt.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BringMeAHigherLunch,"Everyone complaining about the lack of epic music in episode 3:

Episode 4: *h e l l o  t h e r e*"
BringMeAHigherLunch,hrdp453,Internet Explorer has joined the chat.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BigBoiJamethan,did levi fly away before the grenade detonated or did he suicide bomb????
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,smokeysabo,"wait, how did the ODM missile miss Pieck?"
smokeysabo,SippingTeaInYoHood,I'm pretty sure it was the steam. like bertholts ability
SippingTeaInYoHood,smokeysabo,"riiight, I thought the dialogue was weird after he says "" was it the steam or..."". after rewatching it definitely looks like smoke. does the second dialogue then refer to his doubt on himself or perhaps Pieck being affected by something else? kinda seems unnecessary to have the ""it can't be my aim"" dialogue."
smokeysabo,JooK8,Jean hesitated because he is not a bad person and Falco begged him not to.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yomnot,Can anyone tell me the numbers of the manga chapters that were covered in episode 7?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ginestra7,Did Levi blew himself up? What the heck happened there? What was that thing about timing from Zeke? Was he referring to the airship plane? If so how did he know? SO MANY QUESTIONS
Ginestra7,JooK8,"Levi didn't blow himself up, there's no reason for him to, and you can see him alive and well in the preview for EP8.  

There are many things Zeke can be referring to, it all depends whether you believe Zeke is a double-agent or not.  

If you do, then Zeke would know about the incoming nuke from Armin and the blimp that follows to pick them up.  That is their only escape route, so they are running out of time to accomplish what they came to do.  

Or if he is truly loyal to Marley then he knows that 30,000 soldiers from the fleet and many other infantry soldiers are closing in on Liberio.  With no knowledge that they are about to get nuked, Levi + scouts would have limited time to accomplish what they came to do before they'd get screwed by the Marley army. 

OR he could be referring to the fact that he knows Levi really wants to kill him.  There is less than a year left before Zeke has reached 13 years as beast titan and he will either get eaten by Colt or die and the power transferred randomly to an Eldian.  In this regard, Levi would be running out of time to have their rematch and be the one to personally kill him."
JooK8,Ginestra7," I like your last theory but I think it's something more imminent since Levi is holding a watch.
And yes, of course I know he didn't *actually* blew himself up  but that scene it's pretty weird."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maklenovic,Which chapter is episode 7?
maklenovic,Spokane_Lone_Wolf,"The last half of Chapter 102, all of Chapter 103, and most of Chapter 104."
Spokane_Lone_Wolf,maklenovic,thank you :)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fullmoonpie,Did Levi blow himself up with that grenade???
fullmoonpie,JooK8,No.  That would be awfully dumb of him to kill himself after he just took down the Beast Titan with almost no effort and no injury.  You can see him alive in the preview for next episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Speech500,I've never shouted 'YES' before to a TV show but I did when Eren ate the other titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oppsedopse,I don't know how they did it introducing new characters without boring me maybe it was because of the cliff hangers at the end of ever ep or i just liked to see how Reiner was doing after what he did and also tell me if i am wrong why does it fell like the anime is just getting started even tho it's the final season.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,silverstyrofoam,"Erin is committing horrific acts of violence, but I think it's justified and necessary. Erin is taking the role of devil to save his people. What do you guys think?"
silverstyrofoam,NaughtyDreadz,I think Erin is pretty sexy. She's got a great ass!
NaughtyDreadz,silverstyrofoam,"I'm not gay, but he is very attractive this season."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nivvy,"So does Erin get the Warhammer power now too? Also the armour Titan looks quite different now, more spiky....?"
nivvy,BrianDawkins,Yes Eren will get it‚Äôs new powers.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zarysium,"Feel free to spoil me, currently watching season 2 and regarding connie's family. Were they gone for good? Isn't it possible to save them by Levi's technique and removing the human form from their necks?"
Zarysium,BrianDawkins,No connies family is gone for good. They can‚Äôt turn back. Only way to ‚Äúsave‚Äù them is if they eat the spine fluid of a person who has a titan with powers.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OldNeb,"So is Bernhardt going to snap out of it and, with his unique perspective, become a key player in turning the mainland Eldians against Marley?

Nah he‚Äôll probably follow the trope and just crack and go berserk on Eren..."
OldNeb,Doctor_God,Who?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arebee20,"What was up with both Zeke and Levi holding pocket watches and Zeke was saying come on Levi times almost up before he got one shotted?

Is there a possibility that Zeke was secretly in contact with Paradis and is now on their side and they had Levi grenade him to fake his death or something? Idk"
arebee20,BrianDawkins,I thought Levi was waiting for Hange and her squad. And I took Zeke saying that because his teammates will run out of gas to move around leaving him out numbered
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BrianDawkins,That one girl Titan got fucked up
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThroGM,Best episode so far! But I feel like it is just an intro to Aerin vs Raynor.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dormozilla,"What did Zeke mean when he said ""you're running out of time"" to Levi??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,geriatricgary,"Okay so, does ANYBODY have any ideas as to who the tall bearded solider is that led Pieck and Pock into the hole in episode 5? I keep racking my brain trying to figure it out but nobody comes to mind. The best explanation I‚Äôve come up with so far is that we‚Äôre supposed to think it‚Äôs Armin as a sort of fake-out. But there‚Äôs really no point to that if they‚Äôre going to reveal him in the next episode anyway. And Pieck being suspicious of him and thinking she‚Äôs seen him before, it definitely seems like we should know this guy."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zact619,"Anyone still thinking Zeke is a double agent, I still can‚Äôt help but think he‚Äôs good. Especially with certain things he‚Äôs said, like on the roof before the general came up, and he was talking about his secrets, when he said Eren is not his enemy, I feel like he was sending a message almost, and using Levi as the Decoy, and the slashing is to almost Evacuate him from it all, I have no idea, just my theory. Just seems strange."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,coedgirl,I‚Äôm also upset *very little bit* that Eren didn‚Äôt just eat the jaw titan right then and there even though Reiner transformed but I am hoping it‚Äôs explained or the next episode opens up Eren just eating him anyway in front of Reiner lol.  This is the only thing so far to upset me in the show since picking Armin over Erwin but that was a way bigger deal than this.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yausuo,"The fact that Levi sticks with the blades and scout cloak makes him that much more of a badass. It‚Äôs crazy to think that we as fans can just see a flash of green and we know its him. All his action moments are breathtaking to watch. Levi truly is humanity‚Äôs greatest soldier

Edit: spelling"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shankshardy007,"What a counterattack by humanity against the titans. 
Damn..after years of being hunted...finally Eren and company have become the hunters. 
I have never felt soo satisfied watching AoT ever. Its always where humanity had to suffer soo much loss to take one step forward...and here you see them giving back tenfold...woow what a story. 
The titans should know how it feels to be attacked and destroyed in your own backyard. And the team did it... hopefully everyone goes out from there safely. Seriously fingers crossed...cause AoT tends to always twist the shit at the end."
shankshardy007,Raknel,"But the colossal titan just nuked half a city, it's titans killing humans all over again. If anything this was a loss for humanity."
Raknel,shankshardy007,"But had they not done that, wouldnt the same people send warriors to paradis ro destroy the city...??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnirudhMenon94,"Man, the story of this season reminds me a lot of The Last of Us Part 2 ( in a great way. I loved that game )"
TheDankestPassions,AutoModerator,"# Make sure to flair posts correctly so you don't spoil the story for others.

### REMEMBER TO BE CIVIL.


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/attackontitan) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
TheTrueFishbunjin,sockermomm,I was the exact same. Went the whole show waiting for this to be part of some big twist
TheTrueFishbunjin,Sex_Explorer,I think it was just there to point at the fact that titans' flesh is plants-based.
TheDankestPassions,0liverLemon,Hanges gender was meant to be ambiguous. The creator told the translators for the manga to avoid gendered terms for them.
TheDankestPassions,Gaesus,"In the dub, shortly before he reveals that he's the armored titan, Reiner is talking with Armin and Eren  and says ""Remember when I got grabbed by Annie"" as opposed to saying ""Remember when I got grabbed by the female titan"" in the sub. At that point in the story, Reiner technically wasn't supposed to know the identity of the female titan (from the scouts' POV) but nobody bats an eye when he name drops Annie.

All this to say, while some mistakes may get fixed, other mistakes can also be made"
TheDankestPassions,DOOMFOOL,"No. Zero chance it was intentional. We literally know that shifters can control their transformations to accomplish their goal when transforming, and this is obviously what that is meant to convey."
TheDankestPassions,Sinesjoe,Why did this get downvoted to hell???
TheDankestPassions,AtmoranSupremecist,Hange is a woman and it‚Äôs pretty clear
TheDankestPassions,erdal94,"Bruh, why are you getting downvoted?"
TheDankestPassions,GanondorfDownAir,Reddit hivemind at its finest
TheDankestPassions,GoatLord8,Dub cope
TheDankestPassions,ninjapants24601,Why is this so downvoted?
TheDankestPassions,VColyness,"What is everyone talking about? If you look in prior shots, the flowers ARE there, but he says the flowers are only inside the Titan. That‚Äôs because Eren wanted to protect what was inside the circumference of the Titan."
VColyness,Psychological-Air205,Yeah. People don‚Äôt pay attention to the show they watch.
Psychological-Air205,VColyness,"Ikr

Anyways, do you think Eren actually ate his mother‚Äôs eyes with the founding Titan? In season 3 episode 11, Keith Sadies says ‚Äúthose eyes are your mothers‚Äù, so maybe when he punched Dina, he used the power of the founding Titan to switch eyes with his mom!

/s"
Psychological-Air205,sketchy_marcus,How am I supposed to watch this show while I‚Äôm reading these comments at the same time tho.
VColyness,Lilog371,OP just gonna ignore this comment?
TheDankestPassions,kenspik,"No, the flowers were already there it‚Äôs a mistranslation, armins just surprised that he could even protect the flowers inside of him"
kenspik,TheDankestPassions,"I prefer the Japanese voice actors, but I do consider the Dub to be the more ""official"" version, as it's the most up to date version that had the most time to fix any way it wanted to communicate the story compared to the earlier-released subtitled version."
TheDankestPassions,TokugawaShigeShige,"I find it hard to believe that Isayama or anyone from the Japanese anime staff would contact the foreign language scriptwriters with patch notes for their dubs. It's a lot more likely that it's just a bad translation.

The Japanese script should really be seen as the ""official"" one, since it largely uses dialogue copy-pasted from the original creator.  Idk if this particular line of dialogue was in the manga though."
TheDankestPassions,Regirex,"the dub is not the most ""official version"". the most official version is the manga in Japanese, then the original anime in Japanese. it's never the dub, unless we're talking about Ghost Stories. they don't communicate and correct in the dub after the original already came out. that's just incorrect in so many ways"
TheDankestPassions,kenspik,"What??? That‚Äôs just wrong

You do realize the main production team in Japan doesn‚Äôt affiliate with the dub teams in foreign countries right? Mistranslations are frequent"
TheDankestPassions,HamsterFromAbove_079,"That's not how that works. You have obviously never done anything with translations. Translations are notoriously difficult because languages aren't 1 for 1. If it was 1 for 1 it would be a code, not a different language. If you translate anything more than a couple words long you are almost guaranteed to have different translators provide different translations.

Translations are so very frequently riddled with errors. They don't ""have the most time to fix"" things. They have the chance to fuck it up.

The translation of anything is NEVER the ""official"" version. The only thing that could ever be the official version is something that is written and checked by the original author in a language they understand and are extremely fluent in. 

I cannot stress this enough. Translations are filled with errors. I don't know where you got the perception that you can trust the translations more than the originals. Because the reality is the exact opposite.

Shows NEVER ""fix"" things in a translation. They don't change story points intentionally for translations. They don't intentionally change what people say based on which language of release. Any changes are a result of translation errors."
TheDankestPassions,skullmonster602,lol ‚Äúthe official version‚Äù
TheDankestPassions,PM-ME-YOUR-1ST-BORN,Hate to break it to ya but the dub absolutely makes mistakes. Do you remember the dialogue in Warrior? Reiner - who is not supposed to know that the scouts have discovered Annie's identity - mentions the female titan by Annie's name. At that point his character was had not yet found out that information as he had been put in isolation with some others before the Stohess mission... but the dub crew confused the timeline and thus the dialogue got messed up.
TheDankestPassions,Nice_Active8187,That‚Äôs quite a slap in the face to the original creators of the work. Like calling a print of an artwork the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù version compared to the artist‚Äôs original
TheDankestPassions,TheCrowWhisperer3004,"Actually it‚Äôs the dub that ends up with more mistakes. This is because they have to modify the sentences and words in the dub to make it match with the timing. In this process, a lot of information can be lost or incorrectly portrayed. The subs can go for a simpler more direct translation without having to worry as much about the fancy wordplay to fit the sentences in, which often makes them more accurate."
TheDankestPassions,M_raenow,The show shows the titan powers grow trees on multiple occasions especially with the founder
TheDankestPassions,InfluentialInvestor,Farmer Titan
InfluentialInvestor,Consistent_Address_3,Kashimo was fighting Titans the whole time fr
Consistent_Address_3,ZipperMan555,damn nothing is safe from Jjk is it? üíÄüòÇ
InfluentialInvestor,Sotarnicus,ANR real
TheDankestPassions,TheUglyBarnaclee,OP really can‚Äôt just accept that it‚Äôs just a translation error
TheUglyBarnaclee,RedHotRevolvers,This sub has really made me realize how this show was so many peoples' first anime.
RedHotRevolvers,TheUglyBarnaclee,"Fr, like considering any dub the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù translation even over the manga is just clownish"
TheDankestPassions,IWishIWasGreenBruh,"That is interesting, but I think the original post is simply a translational error. The symbolism is in that Eren‚Äôs titan made a protective rib cage around his friends and the flower, representative of his mindset and newfound role/power."
TheDankestPassions,Bulky_Secretary_6603,Iron Bamboo is also what thier blades used to be made from if I'm not mistaken
TheDankestPassions,lieconamee,I do I was just thinking about it actually. They never expanded on it
lieconamee,TheDankestPassions,"It probably explains bamboo iron, the titan forest that Zeke describes as a ""unique place in the world,"" and the abnormally large trees that appear to exist above the source of all living matter."
TheDankestPassions,The_Dark_Sapphire1,"That's clever

Edit: Could iceburst stone be titan steam condensed into a solid? I mean, it's unique to their island, just like the bamboo and giant trees. Would have a sort of irony to it as well."
TheDankestPassions,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"That's a nice connection, but that seems much more like the domain of the (royal) Founding Titan, or the ""titan science"" that came up with the Ackerman clan"
TheDankestPassions,Regirex,"it's a translation error. it meant to say something along the lines of ""the flowers are untouched"", showing the finesse and subconscious control that one can have over titan powers. Eren only blocked the cannonball; he didn't touch the surrounding environment"
TheDankestPassions,One_Subject3157,"Also, there was a escene of titan vomit, a cristalized soldier cause it ate too much.

Whats the point to show that?"
One_Subject3157,Exylatron,I think that was just meant to show how the titans are a biological mystery
One_Subject3157,Dinkulshlops,"I believe it was to show that titans dont need to eat humans, they eat them bcuz for whatever reason they just decide to. They dont need them to live or anything"
Dinkulshlops,occupiedbrain69,No the actual reason what they've told is that Titans eat human not for food but thinking that every human maybe one of those nine and so eating humans will turn the mindless Titans back into humans. it's a biological need but not for food but for survival.
One_Subject3157,TheDankestPassions,"Just to show that they don't eat humans for food, raising the question as to why they eat people. And they didn't look crystalized. Just covered in vomit and maybe a bit melted from heat."
One_Subject3157,hoitytoity-12,"It was to show that the titans did not *need* to eat humans to survive. I'd be one thing if they needes humans to get nutrition from to live (circle of life), but the fact they just sick their stomach up when it's full and continue eating live humans shows they eat humans just because they can, which makes them more terrifying and difficult for Paradis locals to understand. Titans will never stop eating just because they had their fill for the day. To humans the titans are just a near unstoppable force of death with no rhyme or reason."
One_Subject3157,Julian-Hoffer,Way back in 2013 I read that eventually everyone in those will become titans and that‚Äôs why they burned them but apparently that was just made up
Julian-Hoffer,HamsterFromAbove_079,"The basement chapter was published in September of 2016. Anything written in 2013 was just a crackpot fan theory. Nobody but Isayama knew anything about the truth of Titans in 2013.

In 2013 we were still riding the waves of The Walking Dead Season 3 where they just revealed that everyone was already infected with the zombie virus. That concept overran pop culture for a little bit. It got thrown around as a theory for Attack on Titan despite it never having any real support in canon."
One_Subject3157,shinobi_4739,"in manga version, it was just corpses mixed up with fresh and already decayed ones covered with vomit. Anime version 'censored' it like it was covered with crystal or candy-like substance."
TheDankestPassions,OmegaBoi420,The power of the Founder is a pathway to many abilities some would consider to be unnatural
TheDankestPassions,Hon3ynuts,The implication is that he protected the plants not that they grew just then.
Hon3ynuts,TheDankestPassions,But Armin says that they weren't there before.
TheDankestPassions,rebillihp,"He only says that in the dub, in the sub he does not say that. It was just an error"
TheDankestPassions,LightThatIgnitesAll,"Here is what we know:

The purple flowers are known as bellflowers (Hananira).

- The purple flowers appear in both WIT and MAPPA's adaptation. We can even see purple petals when Eren enters paths and recalls the episode 1 memory reanimated by MAPPA.
- The purple flowers are used in promoting merchandise for Mikasa.
- Purple flowers (Saintpaulias in this case) appear in Muv-Luv (the series that inspired Isayama to make AOT). Muv-Luv mentions in floriography Saintpaulias mean "" a delicate love.""
- Yuki Kaji mentioned bellflowers (Hananira) symbolise ""a sad farewell and enduring love"".
- The flowers appear only in scenes where Mikasa and Eren are present. In this scene Eren defends Mikasa by transforming.
- Kaji then mentions the date the flowers were founded..... which was February 10th. The same date as Mikasa's birthday.

[You can watch Kaji's interview on it here.](https://x.com/melodikasa/status/1403703030487392256?s=20)

(You can copy and paste this response whenever anyone asks about it. Seems a common question.)"
LightThatIgnitesAll,randomizer_in_end,"Can't believe it means that much, talk about details"
TheDankestPassions,Redragon9,OP going through mental gymnastics because he doesnt want to accept that it‚Äôs an error
TheDankestPassions,yuriscousinligma,"Armin doesn't notice that the flowers magically appear. He notices that the interior space of the skeleton was protected from the heat of Eren's transformation. In the following shot, you'll notice that the floor on which the flowers are on are still gray stone, but beyond the skeleton, the ground is black and singed."
TheDankestPassions,blukwolf,"I never took it as titans growing flowers, but more in the sense that, even if Eren is being accused of being a threat to humanity and then the soldiers proceed to threaten them (Armin, Eren and Mikasa) with the cannons, Eren takes the gamble to protect them and then Armin notices the flowers survived the transformation, thus protecting them.

It felt symbolic, to show that the titan's powers could be used in a good way as well"
TheDankestPassions,grinberB,Lmao this dub mistranslation had me thinking until the very last episode that they would discover a special life creating or resurrection power
TheDankestPassions,Janostar213,Bruh what? He basically said Eren's titan protected the flowers from blowing up. They were already there lol.
TheDankestPassions,Arcaneus_Umbra,Cannot believe this has 1k likes

knds71,kenspik,Lol wtf
knds71,TheDankestPassions,"The lyrics to the final ending do say ""time has brought me gentle days, just like the flowers I sent to you."" Probably just means the flowers she brought to his grave, but it could also have a double meaning there."

TheDankestPassions,1KingCam,Someone missed some very important parts of the ending lol
TheDankestPassions,Anal-Logical,"Not only plants, I believe animals too. It appears to me that Eren himself was turned into a crow along with all the scouts. My only clue for this is the crow that replaced Mikasa's scarf at the very end. It got the be Eren somehow"

TheDankestPassions,Anal-Logical,"MY bad for the bird, but I still think my theory holds"
Anal-Logical,NueWorld4All,You‚Äôre partly right. His transformations turn other people into animals like Jean into a horse
TheDankestPassions,Logical-Patience-397,"I used to think the presence of titans enhanced the growth of all plants‚Äîthus why Paradis had a ‚Äògiant forest‚Äô and every shot was filled with vibrant flowers. The physical manifestation of ‚Äúthis world is cruel, but also very beautiful.‚Äù"

taopooh,Fish_Fucker69,Her daughters were forced to eat her dead body. This shit is messed up.
Fish_Fucker69,B3ansb3ansb3ans,Probably took them a couple of days to do so(I am assuming because they were 3 kids eating like 40-50kgs of meat and bones) . The meat must have been rotten and full of bugs by then.
Fish_Fucker69,W0lfsb4ne74,"Not to mention being raped at like 11 consistently in order to have multiple children by a man in his 30s or 40s easily, and then consistently being used as a weapon to kill other tribes at King Fritz's command."
Fish_Fucker69,KaMeLRo,"And daughters didn't even need to, right?  Because being Ymir's daughter are already titans."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reborno,Hearbraking to see Armin grasping at straws hoping for the best. But then Eren tells everyone that he's about to kill the rest of the world LOL.

Reborno,Forsaken-Currency404,"Armin figured Eren was going to kill everyone outside as soon as he noticed other walls being broken as well.

He just sometimes loves going around in circles asking questions prompting the other guy to answer it themselves."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cydia-Gamer,It felt so good when Ymir made that angry face

Cydia-Gamer,Randomness-66,"What was interesting was how we don‚Äôt see her eyes or her expression much before that moment, she just accepts her fate. Even when she‚Äôs stabbed, it‚Äôs a possibility she could heal herself, but doesn‚Äôt try and no one helps her. We know she‚Äôs a consort at most, as we see Fritz get married."
Randomness-66,jediwizard7,"They deliberately covered her eyes in shadow (and those of all the other characters in the flashbacks).

Randomness-66,CaktusJacklynn,"It was the not seeing her eyes that did it for me. A person thrown into a tough situation with no identity outside of being the Founding Titan whose powers were exploited by a king.

Cydia-Gamer,I_TittyFuck_Doves,"Actually tho. I don‚Äôt know about about the manga so I had no idea she was a slave, just thought she was some girl who made a deal with the devil. Good god I love this show

I_TittyFuck_Doves,TheOTB,"And I feel that false belief of Ymir just showcases one of the major themes of this brilliant saga‚Äîstereotyping, prejudices and biases are some of the worst human tendencies. Because we often get people wrong when we blindly adhere to them."
I_TittyFuck_Doves,humxnprinter,Damn that edit tho
I_TittyFuck_Doves,PopsFickle,"Yes! Your gender norm comment got me thinking.. 

How this ‚Äúladylike‚Äù ideal Ymir was juxtaposed with mega- masculine violent rage Eren in this episode. 

I see commentary on more broad ideals of masculinity and femininity (more in a yin/yang way than literal gender) through Ymir‚Äôs and Erens relationship/ connection. 

Ymir just wanted to ‚Äúhelp and be loved by people‚Äù, leading her to self sacrifice her body and soul to be used and abused by others, submissive, ‚Äúlady-like‚Äù, a good slave, child bearer.

Zeke tells her to be this good girl again, and end it. End her people, sacrifice again.

The constant abuse this ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù manifestation Ymir felt, led to the creation and eventual meeting with the ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù manifestation Eren, created to protect by attack and violence not self sacrifice. 

Eren then says she can stand up for herself, make her OWN decision. Which she then finally does. How unladylike. 

And that decision was basically violent deaths for the whole world. Very aggressively dominant. 

The flower with the blood splatter comes to mind."

Cheese_Boi_69,spacecadet0226,This. Turns out the Rumbling is ofc Eren‚Äôs plan but also the first expression of Ymir‚Äôs free will after eons in the Path as a slave to the Fritz blood line. Wild.
Cheese_Boi_69,Kangermu,"Yeah, already forgot but Zeke said he'd already been there for years in the microseconds that have passed. She's been doing this for an incomprehensible amount of time"
Cheese_Boi_69,Dilsosos,"So everytime a shifter transforms, she‚Äôs the one doing it?

Edit: Building the titan bodies I mean."
Cheese_Boi_69,Rexamidalion,Actually 2000 years
Cheese_Boi_69,holloheaded,"it's not that time is slower there, it's that the realm of the coordinate is outside of time.  that's the whole reason the paths work like they do.  it's the same reason the attack titan can see future memories.  every instance of time is accessible at any moment via the coordinate, similar how you can pick out any frame in a movie or jump in wherever you want.  the difference being that instead of existing in a ""frames per second"" fashion, time has literally infinite divisions and can't be divided into basic instances because those instances could be infinitely divided and so on and so forth.  

the way the titan building works is ymir sees in one instance that a shifter is going to transform, so she builds their titan and then sends it to them through paths into that moment in time, but since that instance is basically just a ""frame"" (again ""frame"" is a generalization of the idea of an instance of time) of time it seems like an instant to the shifter who exists within the dimensions of time.

just to hypothesize on the nature of the realm of the coordinate a bit more there are a couple of ways that things can take place there without a flow of time.

one is that there is a localized, linear passage of time in the realm of the coordinate because if there were no passage at all then nothing could take place and everything would be frozen in one instance making movement impossible and preventing pretty much anything from existing there unless it was placed by an even more extradimensional being/force.

another way is that whatever exists in the realm of the coordinate \*appears\* to have a physical makeup but is actually composed of something that can function without the flow of time to allow it to persevere.  in my opinion this isn't the case in attack on titan because the titans are very much physical creations.  obviously there's room for infinite theoretical exceptions like the titans being just ""blueprints"" that are then manifested into a physical form once they arrive in the physical world but that applies to any theory.

my opinion is that this is the way it works in aot: in a fictional world like this one you can say that a person, place or thing exists in adherence to our universes laws of physics while still outside of time and just allow them to move through and affect their environment freely while while doing so.  in reality that is impossible, but fiction comes along with concessions and at a certain point no one cares.

in any of those cases however, ymir has been in the realm of the coordinate a finite amount of time.  an unimaginably long time, but a finite one.  however, depending upon how things play out she could very well end up there for eternity."
Original-Ad4399,DarthDookieMan,"Well, yeah, pretty much. She is a slave after all.

It is well represented in her titan form as well. Skeletal, as in no sense of self, despite its power."
Original-Ad4399,Koolco,"Not brainwashed but more ‚Äúignorant‚Äù. I mean she was a random uneducated girl in some human dark ages level time. Couldn‚Äôt speak, And was treated like well, a slave. Its like she was never even introduced to the idea of free will. Besides, once she obtained the founder she wasn‚Äôt being literally tortured, willing to bet that makes it a lot easier to just do what you‚Äôre told."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GutsyEddy,"Ymir lived a horrible life as a slave and then was used as a scapegoat when it benefited the other slaves. She never did wrong yet was constantly used by others. 

King Fritz was a disgusting power hungry man, forcing his own daughters to eat their dead mother who had died for him and instructing future generations to carry out the same ritual. The current circumstances are because of him. 

Even though Eren is going to destroy the rest of the world, at the very least, I‚Äôm glad that Ymir got to make her own decision for once."
GutsyEddy,Sponge56,What do you think would happen if the girls never ate their mom? Would the the creatures power that touched ymir just die with her?
Sponge56,GutsyEddy,That‚Äôs literally what I was thinking. Ymir would‚Äôve died along with the power. But by the daughters eating their mother that‚Äôs when the power probably became a part of them (you are what you eat) and Fritz probably noticed that the spinal fluid was where the power resides.

shitsfuckedupalot,Beginning_Ball9475,"That wasn't Hange, that was Pieck. Remember that Pieck was wearing the Scouts uniform to blend in originally in order to get close to Eren so that Porco Jaw Titan could attempt to steal the Founding Titan. Hange always has her hair tied back, while Pieck usually has her hair out. It was tied up when she was handcuffed to Gabi but then came loose again when she became Cart Titan. It makes more sense for Pieck to be right there than Hange, since she's on the scene. Plus if you look closely, you can see the titan lines on her face. Hange doesn't have a titan, only titan-shifters like Pieck have the titan lines on her face in human form"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"The coordinate seems like a allegory to the tree of life except only for eldians. 

Season 3 episode 21 8:20

>Eren Kruger says people believe Ymir touched the source of all life to get her powers 


Season 4 episode 15 10:05 

>The previous beast Titan says that the founder Ymir touched an unknown something and that‚Äôs how she got the power of the Titans. 



There‚Äôs some small details in this episode about the coordinate that was shown visually. I think Ymir is the trunk and the branches are her children. When the kings daughters(Maria, Rose, and Sina) are made to eat her body the coordinate flashes and we see 3 large [branches](https://i.imgur.com/GiXkIBY.jpg) appear. 

The king then tells them to [multiply ](https://i.imgur.com/0WobgHG.jpg)

And when those children die he wants them to eat their spines as well and again we see the branches of the [coordinate](https://i.imgur.com/WA9K9Ss.jpg) has grown. It seems to only be growing when the power of the Titan is inherited though."
Johnny20022002,matthieuC,"I'm confused about the whole thing.  
How did we end up with 9 thinking titans? No morew no less.  
Why is Ymir connected to the eldians, she was not kindnapped into the tribe.  
The only people related to her by blood would be her descendants, so the people of royal blood.  
Or if all the people we call eldian today are her descendants what the hell is the royal line?  
Something similar to today's royalty's based on legal inheritance?"
matthieuC,obbelusk,"I'm just thinking out loud here. 

Maybe new thinking titans could only be created by very close ascendants to Ymir. Or maybe they stopped eating their moms after the next generation."
matthieuC,JonKovacs,">Why is Ymir connected to the eldians, she was not kidnapped into the tribe.

Because the King of the Eldian people, after she has conquered his foes for him, said, ""You have done well for me, my slave. I shall award you with my seed,"" which connects her to the Eldian bloodline by bearing his children.

>How did we end up with 9 thinking titans? No morew no less.

I'm not sure. If I had to guess it's because each of the three had two kids, totaling nine, and that was when they started eating each other? Maybe? I don't know."
matthieuC,ToastyTheDragon,"It makes more sense when you consider the scale of time. For example in the real world, [every person alive in Europe 1000-2000 years ago is the ancestor of every person of European descent alive today](https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/all-europeans-are-related-if-you-go-back-just-1-6C9826523).  Basicaly if you're white: Pick a random person who was alive in Europe 1500 years ago. Very likely that that person is one of your ancestors.  

The same thing can happen here. After 2000 years of breeding, every Eldian in the modern AoT world has genes that originally came from Ymir.  Just sorta got mixed around through the milennia.

>Or if all the people we call eldian today are her descendants what the hell is the royal line?
Something similar to today's royalty's based on legal inheritance?

My guess? A fuck load of incest.  Maybe because they're closely connected to that snake/spine thing, they don't get defects like you would with real inbreeding. I don't know though lol"
matthieuC,jediwizard7,"I also wonder about how ""pure"" titans started. Ymir's children weren't titans when they ate her, and we've never seen that otherwise but for all we know maybe it still works, its just not the conventional way... because it's probably a lot harder to convince someone to eat their parents while still conscious.

My guess is the dumb titans were originally created when the ""power of ymir"" was stretched thin, and after being split into 9 it couldn't be split into more, resulting in only the person who consumed the most spinal fluid inheriting the main power and other people who consumed some of the fluid only becoming dumb titans."

Only thing I have in defence of there not being a movie is that the show has cut scenes that appear in the manga, so with rearranging and some cut parts there may be enough to fit in.

NotFreakzz,jediwizard7,"Yeah I think his confident and authoritative voice fits better than some abstract demonic voice. It lets us know that while he's a monster, he's also still human. He's been this way since the day he was born‚Ñ¢"

onceARMY,triggerhappy66,Best moments in cinematic history for me if I can be so bold
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Adhu2000,Attack titan is that part of ymir which always yearned for freedom
Adhu2000,jediwizard7,"Whoah that's an interesting idea, that different parts of her personality were inherited by different titans. And the rebellious part, that was the most repressed, just waited all this time for the moment it knew (through future vision) it would finally be able to break free."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HumpondaPump,"-this episode gives me a whole new image of the painting of her giving the ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù the apple. I always thought the monster was the a founding Titan and Yimr apple was a peace offering of humanity... but now I think the monster is the king... and the apple was the power Ymir offered to him.


Also For years She had to do whatever her ‚Ä¢king‚Ä¢ commanded until Eren For once gave her the option to do what she wanted to and that build up anger led to her giving him the power. That angry ymir face....

Human/Marleian/zeke wanted to controlled and ordered her for 2000 yrs... took a true Eldian to set her free

Erens headless eye shift... that‚Äôs all

Also the fact she was eyeless until given free will..... what writing...

Can‚Äôt wait to see how 3 turned into 9..."
HumpondaPump,reheapify,"Just to show you how both sides (Restorationists and Marley) got the story half right and half wrong. Ancient Elian‚Äôs did build the bridges, but they also destroyed other nations as well. Ymir was not offered by the devil, nor a god, she is just a slave."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,"opening theme these past few episodes: ""RUMBLING, RUMBLING! IT'S COMING!""

me when the rumbling actually came: :0"
amazingaida26,boni127,"""HOLY SHIT HE ACTUALLY DID IT, NO WAYYYYYY!!!"""
amazingaida26,SiBea13,"The greatest strength of AoT is that you can realistically predict nearly every plot twist but the execution and suspense leading up to it still blows you away. As soon as you realise in like the first episode that ""oh, it's about war"" you can figure out ""okay so the Titans must be humans because if the theme is war then humans have to be the bad guys"".

Then you think ""titans are mindless animals though so there has to be someone or something controlling them"" and as soon as you're told that the Founding Titan can change memories then you can figure out ""oh, it's all a lie and there's humans outside the wall"". Even if you ignore the fact that Reiner keeps on going on about his war chief and HQ and Grisha was found outside the walls you can figure it out.

Even if season 4 didn't straight up tell you that the full scale Rumbling was gonna happen you can tell that it would simply because of how Eren has been portrayed. Since day 1 he's used words like ""exterminate"" and has been thinking of nothing but murder since then. It was obvious that it would come to this and it's still fantastic."

GutsyEddy,realkin1112,"Well I think that Frieda's titan is small and weak, remember that it takes time and training to get used to your titan and I think this was Freida's 1st ever transformation after getting the founding"
realkin1112,demoncyborgg,The vow renouncing war probably had something to do with it.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jandcando,"As soon as Ymir's daughters ate her remains, you can see there are now three branches of the tree and that it multiplies the more the blood spreads. That makes sense, but I'm still confused on how that distilled into nine distinct titans with unique powers. And where the pure titans fit into this. Maybe that's the next part of this backstory, or have I missed something?"
jandcando,Slushin21,Well pure titans are just people injected with titan serum that Marley used to keep the people on the island in side the walls.

PoohBearing,RajinKajin,"We did see hange, no Levi that I saw though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tkv_is_pro,"1. Damn, they really cut back to showing Grisha's slaughter of the entire family (save Rod Reiss) in detail, just to pad out the episode length eh.  
What a brutal scene nonetheless  


  
2. I guess Eren isn't omniscient with regard to the future.  
Much prefer it this way tbh; an overpowered protagonist is no fun.  
On a side note, he really is batshit crazy with his willpower, breaking his hands free of the chains like that.  


  
3. And there it is, the title card that illustrates just how meticulous the author of this story has planned everything out since DAY ONE.  A story almost a decade in the making (anime release time) (Season 1, EP1 (2013) title - ""To You, 2,000 Years From Now""; Season 4P2, EP5 (2022) title - ""From You, 2,000 Years Ago"")  
For the manga, I'd assume it's about the same length of time.  
Just insane levels of story boarding/ planning.  


  
4. (Wall) Maria, Rose, and Sina ‚Ä¶ oh my, there really is no wasted detail in this story  


  
5. Well now we know Eren's real plan and ... jesus christ Eren, batshit crazy doesn't begin to describe what you are.  
  


6. A while ago, I had a thought that Attack On Titan is the origin story of a villain, and this episode kind of validates me I feel.  
  


7. On a side note, this is what Game of Thrones tried and HORRENDOUSLY FAILED at doing with Daenerys Targaryen (yes I am still INCREDIBLY salty at just how bad that show ended).  
Let's hope Attack on Titan sticks the landing.  


  
8. Poor Armin too; he sounded so happy and optimistic that Eren was finally on 'their side'."
tkv_is_pro,illumantimess,On 7- it‚Äôs especially galling since AOT has effectively rapidly shifted Eren in the final season in a way that makes Dany‚Äôs total 180 even more unforgivable. The reveal in this episode that Eren saw the future when he kissed Historia‚Äôs hand also really helped explain the drastic change in his character too. So many ways they could have better laid the groundwork for Dany‚Äôs turn!!
illumantimess,tkv_is_pro,"I will forever be bitter at D&D for butchering GoT like that;
Such wasted potential, Daenerys could've been a villain for the ages"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Key_Barber_4161,So is zeke dead now? Erens head transformed while zeke was holding him so will he be crushed/disintegrated? Or do you think his body is on giant erens back like a prisoner while his mind floats about in the blue space with ymir?
Key_Barber_4161,Mudjumper,It almost looked like eren absorbed him when he shifted. Maybe his body is making up the legs and pelvis of eren‚Äôs founding titan?
Mudjumper,SwiftDookie,"So that's what they were fighting over? Loser gets to be the asshole, taint, and shlong?"
Key_Barber_4161,AudaciousXII,Also felt like part of the spike was heading towards Zeke‚Äôs way. Will be interesting if zeke is just alive but he probably has no more energy to use beast again and wonder if he can still control the titans within his fluid

On the other hand this episode was the most beautiful one yet. Everything was 10000/10"
kingofkingx,Twindo,"Remember the villain rarely wins in stories like this. If we think of Eren as a hero, his actions are justified and it makes us angry that people are trying to stop him, if we think of him as a villain we are repulsed by his actions. It‚Äôs all perspective. He is the same as Reiner, both have done and will commit atrocious acts to protect their loved ones. Ultimately it comes down to wherever is more powerful. The show tricks is into thinking Eren has some moral high ground over Marley and the rest of the world but he doesn‚Äôt. Everyone is just trying to keep their loved ones safe."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"Man Ymir‚Äôs backstory is so heartbreak. She‚Äôs basically been a slave her entire life, then instead of being allowed to die she‚Äôs forced to carry on for probably hundred of thousand if not millions of years in the paths dimension making titans and carrying out the will of the royal family. Her own descendant even treating her like a slave. 

Probably the reason she gave eren the true power and form of the founding Titan, as he‚Äôs the only person who treated her like a human. Maybe now Ymirs finally at rest."
Couch-Dogo,WillSchultz,"It was absolutely beautiful how they mixed Fritz saying ‚ÄúTitans will rain until everything will end‚Äù and Eren saying ‚ÄúI will end it all‚Äù.
Really showed that Ymir only wants to finally get peace (in a much more impactful way than the manga did)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BonjourMaBelle,"What crazy symbolism all around! The branching coordinate, an explanation for the importance of shifter spines, Ymir‚Äôs eyes, Eren literally breaking his chains‚Ä¶

Wondering now though about how our understanding of titan origins have been influenced by that sketch of Ymir offering an apple to the devilish looking God of Titans. 

If this ep‚Äôs flashbacks are true (and it seems they are) then the true story (as some other commenter astutely pointed out) comes instead from the ‚Äúhallucigenia‚Äù looking ‚Äòthing‚Äô gifting titan powers to Ymir ‚Äî apropos nothing ‚Äî to save her life. 

Which, cool, but that black and white still frame towards the end of the episode‚Ä¶ that was Eren, right? Glowing green eyes, crazy attack titan hair, murderous intent?

What if the apple we‚Äôve seen Ymir gifting up until now was actually the power of the founding titan? And the devilish looking creature was Eren? We‚Äôve seen Eren influence the last two attack titans on his own until now, but with the full power of the founder, how long might he be able to pull strings?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,av1922004,Eren and Zeke both have extreme contrasting ideologies. Eren wants to kill everyone outside the walls while Zeke everyone inside.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShadowDome,The Way Historia looked she must have either known this would happen or she saw a memory of the future aswell when Eren kissed her hand
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,doggler88,I think Rod Reiss's weird enormous slug titan was a bastard version of what Eren became because he didn't have the founding titan

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,venkrish,"1. How did Eren manage to convince Ymir with just 2 sentences? WTF happened there?

2. How did Ymir become a slave to the king even though she could've crushed him at any instant?

3. How did Ymir's children get powers by eating the spinal fluid? When Rod Reiss tried that he turned into abnormal. How tf did the titan split into 9 titans?

I have more questions than answers from this episode."
venkrish,lgn3000,"on 2. there is a good kids story, ""The chained Elephant"", that describes exactly this situation:

>The circus elephant was chained to a stake since long, but very small. I remember I closed my eyes and thought about the little elephant newborn attached to the stake. I imagined him pushing and pulling the stake, day 
after day, trying to loosen up ‚Ä¶ I could almost see him fall asleep every night exhausted by the effort, thinking back to try the next morning. Everything was useless: the stake was too strong for a newborn animal, even in the case of a elephant. Until one day, the saddest day of his short life, the little elephant has accepted that he could not free himself and surrendered to their fate. I understood then why the huge and mighty elephant I saw in the circus is left chained stay: he was convinced that never could free itself of its stake. The poor animal had recorded failure in your memory like an elephant and never, ever, had come to test the strength."
lgn3000,taopooh,Learned helplessness.
lgn3000,venkrish,so Ymir was a slave for very long before being hunted and getting powers? that would make sense.
lgn3000,ParticularOccupied34,"Basically, Isayama is showing how freedom is more than just a state of the body but also of the mind."
venkrish,AceAbdullah12,"My speculations:

1. As eren indicated, it must have been ymir herself who took him there, She has free will deep inside but its her symbolism of slavery to always obey the royal blood and all this time she has been dying inside to finally find someone who (isnt of royal blood) wouldnt order her instead ask her what she wants or tell her that she isnt a slave, Eren told her to be free and that hes finally there for her, thus maybe it convinced her easily as she was waiting for this all along anyways.

2. Ymir was a person who's described in this episode as someone who's always willing to help and do good for others even going so far as risking her own life for it.
In the first line of the opening, its probably indicating this characteristic of her. (All i ever wanted to do was the right thing) So, even though she was abused, she forgave them and helped them nevertheless cuz thats just the person she is.

3. This is a question i have myself.
But still what i think is that, they probably didnt just eat the ""fluid"" as she was shown dissected, so maybe they literally, and i really feel gross while saying this, fed her to those children.
As to how it divided into 9 different titans, i'v no clue. You tell me"
AceAbdullah12,Pecuthegreat,">Ymir was a person who's described in this episode as someone who's always willing to help and do good for others even going so far as risking her own life for it.

I think a half agree to this.

Yes, she was probably a nice person that wanted to help others, probably why she didn't protest the blame of the Pig being laid on her but I disagree she forgave the King or was primarily driven by her urge to help others when she continued to follow the King around. This to me seems to be a combination of timidity, being a pushover and learned helplessness that she may have justified in her mind with being nice and helping others but it is primarily her still thinking herself a slave even after being practically free."
AceAbdullah12,Aggravating_Sea_140,I agree with this. They also give eren deja vu in the first episode which is from ymir. It was ymir who wanted him there
venkrish,MeltyGearSolid,"The point was that everyone was treating her as ""someone who enables them to get what they want"". Eren was the first one who reached paths and told her ""you know what? you don't have to do what you're told"". As a result, she gave him what he wants not because he satisfied some arbitrary condition (royal blood) but because she wanted to."
venkrish,HanLeas,"2. Will be explained down the line  
3. The fluid that Rod Reiss drank was not a founding titan's spinal fluid, it was just the one that turns you into a pure titan. The daughters of Ymir were drinking the founding fluid directly out of Ymir's body.

Regarding the first point, I guess you still have to wait until you finish the anime so you can connect the dots better."
venkrish,AOT_manga_is_WTF,"Ymir was never, ever in her life, told that she is free.
Eren, almost being the essence of freedom, broke her bindings with only these words.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,illumantimess,"One of my favorite parts of Attack on Titan is how it explores how history is manipulated to further the interests of those in power and how there‚Äôs no real pure villains or heroes in civilization conflicts. Thought it did a great job here by showing that both the Marleyan and Restorationist versions of history had some selective grounding in truth: Yes, Ymir helped build roads and bridges with her Titan powers, but she was also used as a tool of destruction to conquer and terrorize societies."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chibaku_Tensei_,"It‚Äôs crazy cause here Eren is being the ‚Äúvillian‚Äù but in the perspective of even Ymir, he‚Äôs her rescuer. Someone for her to relieve her anger through. Zeke saw her as the power she is, Eren saw her as the person she‚Äôs always been"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,festival-papi,"These episodes man, they just keep outdoing each other. I never thought we'd actually see a play-by-play of Grisha slaughtering the Fritz/Reiss but damn, it was brutal especially when Eren immediately taunted Zeke.

Glad we saw how everything started with Ymir, that poor girl, she didn't deserve any of that but the fact that she obeyed for so long is still strange to me. During her life she was essentially a Goddess of War but still chose to obey King Fritz? Also, cool that Isayama had hints of his future plans with naming the Walls after Ymir's daughters. Seeing Eren's Founding Titan and the beginning of the Rumbling was so worth it, we've waited so long

Now a few thoughts: Is there any significance to Eren's Founding Titan having the form really similar to a hallucigenia? Do Titan shifter's die after thirteen years because Ymir wanted it that way or because she died thirteen years after getting her power? How are regular Titans made if Ymir's power was passed on from generation to generation through cannibalism? Since Eren can fully use the Founder's power and now control every Subject of Ymir, can anyone stop him?"
festival-papi,Yasimear,"Well Mikasa is only half Eldian (Levi if he's still alive might be half eldian too) so who knows if Eren can fully control her. Plus there are still Marlian's on Paradis so they could potentially stop him.

But he's looking pretty fucking godlike right now. So it's an uphill battle.

Who woulda guessed that almost 10 years later I'd be half hoping someone could stop him..."
Yasimear,Pecuthegreat,I don't think half Eldian exists. If Ymir is your ancestor you are Eldian but Mikasa is also an Ackermann which I don't know exactly how those are affected.
festival-papi,Flaffyc,"""Is there any significance to Eren's Founding Titan having the form really similar to a hallucigenia?""  
\- it looks cool  
\- it looks alien  
\- it's hallucigenia baybee lets gooooo"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,freehand59,"Oh shoot. I just realized that Ymir physically can't speak. It wasn't just that one guy that had his tongue cut out, but all of the slaves. This is why they pointed to her when she was blamed for the pig running away and why she bowed to show guilt.

This leads to her truly feeling as if she doesn't have a will of her own or any sort of agency. She is merely a shell and a tool for the king. This continues even in death where she spent eons building titans as that was the king's wish. It wasn't until Eren asked her what she wanted that she realized she could even desire something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daskrip,"My biggest question from over 8 years ago, **""why do the Titans exist?""**, has finally been answered. And the more I think about the answer, the more satisfied I get.

At first I considered that maybe they're just a part of the universe and a random element written in to cause lots of drama. But I slowly came to realize just how calculative Isayama is, and thought that maybe there really is an explanation for why Titans coexist with humans. But to give a satisfying origin story for something so intricately developed over so long seemed impossible. And yet, I LOVE how it got explained. 

A parasitic disease is just so fitting. Sure, there are a few logical leaps to take, but *way* fewer than I thought was possible. Parasites do change the biology of organisms, and they could spread to other organisms. 

Why 9 Titans? It's a biological limiter. Biology is a perfect way to restrict a function to a certain numerical limit, as we see this in real life all the time with animals' bodies, such as cats having no more than 10 nipples.

Why 13 years? That's how long the parasite lived in Ymir's body. It remembered that length of time, and programmed it into every subsequent host.

I'm even satisfied with why Subjects of Ymir were under the control of the royal family all these years. The parasite memorized Ymir's psychological state wherein she's subservient to the royal family, and so all subsequent hosts inherited the same trait. It's not completely realistic, but still, THIS IS SUCH A GREAT WAY TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. A parasite just makes sense. Wow."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Krys_Lunar,"Eren has gone and changed a lot through the years. I watched the first 3 seasons. I was rooting for Eren the first 3 seasons. I just‚Ä¶can‚Äôt find myself getting behind this genocidal(and not just of one ethnicity) plan of his. I know a lot of people have been resolutely on his side, and I‚Äôm curious to see how much of the fandom Eren will have justifying this mass genocide."
Krys_Lunar,isthatabingo,"Listen, I‚Äôm not one for genocide‚Ä¶ but realistically speaking‚Ä¶ what other options does he have to protect Eldians? They‚Äôve used the *threat* of the rumbling for ~~2,000~~ ~100 years, and apparently that wasn‚Äôt enough to subdue their enemies, which are now comprised of the entire global community. If the threat didn‚Äôt work, seems they have to follow through‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really know what else they could do."
isthatabingo,Krys_Lunar,"I don‚Äôt have a concrete solution either, but I feel like killing off the vast majority of humanity is‚Ä¶one of the worse ones. The only pro I can see is that it‚Äôs the quickest, for as much of a ‚Äúpro‚Äù as you want to count it.

Even if he does succeed, does he think everyone left will just be ‚ÄúWhooo!!! We survived because Eren murdered everyone else, YEAH!!!‚Äù We‚Äôve already see internal conflict happening, and I doubt everyone off the island dying will be the coming of peace; if anything, it will just make things worse(based on reactions, probably already is making things worse)."
Krys_Lunar,Aggravating_Sea_140,"Tbh this episode made me feel so nostalgic. Eren was finally talking like he used to before unlike his chad behaviour in the whole of s4. Him yelling, shouting, going off about freedom to Ymir. I also think him becoming a villain is? kind of unnecesary?"
Aggravating_Sea_140,Krys_Lunar,"It was a throwback seeing him more expressive again.

There‚Äôs something compelling about Eren‚Äôs transition to a more villainous role that traditional ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù protagonists don‚Äôt have. Eren‚Äôs change - and the many different opinions on it - is one of the reasons I‚Äôve enjoyed this season as much as I have."
Aggravating_Sea_140,ShaidarHaran2,">  I also think him becoming a villain is? kind of unnecesary?

We'll see how it goes, but it's also been earned and right in front of us most of the time. He talked about killing everyone to be free back in...Season 1? And several times since then. Season 3 ended with him pointing across the sea and asking if he killed everyone would they be free.  
 
This was Isayama's game of chicken with us this whole time. How long were we willing to stick to him? How close did we come to genocide? Are some of us still with him even now?  
 
Needless to say, just 10000x better done than the GoT last season flip, this was foreshadowed through the series but we mainly thought he was the protagonist despite it."
Krys_Lunar,GenericCancer99,irl I would never root for mass genocide but in this to see our protagonist do what he says to do will be epic to watch.
GenericCancer99,Krys_Lunar,Fair enough. Plenty of things people find reprehensible in real life are also viewed as entertainment in fiction. I‚Äôve honestly been curious as to how that works out in our psychology.
Krys_Lunar,Changes11-11,"What does it matter,

Just want to live his life with the people around him he cares for and wants them to be safe, the people who he'd known for his whole life.

Why would he care for those outside of Paradis? Those who see them and treat them as Devils anyway.

Once they're dead there's no threat anymore, no titans to worry about, they can finally live freely"
Changes11-11,Krys_Lunar,"Might matter to me, if I was one of those people about to get crushed. Attack on Titan hasn‚Äôt painted everyone besides Eldians as ‚Äúirredeemable, destructive monsters‚Äù, but other humans with their own logic and emotions.

Also, not sure I heard anything about titans disappearing. If anything, most of the people left alive would be Eldian; the very people who can transform into them."
Krys_Lunar,thewend,"Look, I'm not the one to root for genocide... But I like movies/media where the villains win. Eren is the villain in this case? Oh absolutely. Am I rooting for him? Hell yeah"
Krys_Lunar,jtoohey12,I don‚Äôt need to justify it to want to see Eren win. It‚Äôs fascinating to see how his character developed and manipulated events and if it means I watch a show where the ending is that the world is essentially destroyed so be it. It‚Äôs going to be so satisfying if his grand scheme works
jtoohey12,Krys_Lunar,"Some people just want to watch the world burn, can‚Äôt argue with that."
Krys_Lunar,Fake_the_jaB,"I don‚Äôt think many people justify it. But at the end of the day it‚Äôs an Anime, so watching Eren destroy the world would be much more entertaining than watching Him backtrack. I think we can separate justifying mass genocide with preferring a crazy ending with something I‚Äôve never seen before."
Fake_the_jaB,Krys_Lunar,"I‚Äôve seen takes like that, people just wanting to see destruction happen in a fictional universe. But I‚Äôve also seen plenty of people say that Eren *is* justified in doing this; or at the very least that it‚Äôs the only way, so it can‚Äôt be helped.

I don‚Äôt want to see Eren backtrack myself, but I also don‚Äôt want him to achieve his goal."
Krys_Lunar,Amplesamples,"‚ÄòEren, save Paradis Island!‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..


No, not like that."
Krys_Lunar,AzrealNibbs12,"Eren is 100% evil at this point, but I still root for him. Kind of similar to how I was rooting for Light in Death Note. Even if they‚Äôre bad, I still want them to succeed"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NuclearChickenzz,"if all modern eldians stemmed from ymir‚Äôs children, how is there a ‚Äòroyal‚Äô and ‚Äònon-royal‚Äô bloodline?"
NuclearChickenzz,Carsondianapolis,"I don't think it ever gets ACTUALLY explained, but I think it's realistic that only one of her daughters would have inherited the founding titan since there can only be one. Most likely whoever is a direct descendant of that daughter is the royal blood line."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Carazy123,"In case y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt know/think about this:

In Norse mythology, the World Tree, Yggdrasil, has roots that go into the three major divisions of the universe: (basically) hell, the land of the giants, and heaven. The tree spreads into and connects the Nine Realms/Worlds.

Sound familiar?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Costa_Rican_GOD,"Each episode gets better and better and takes my mind on an even bigger roller coaster ride. Love or hate Eren, he just wants to protect his people. Maybe."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zbearbear,Oh baby it's finally here. And that score? Amazing. The animation? Breath taking. Them boys are finally walking.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AungmyintmyatHane,"Everyone asks ""Where is Ymir""

but nobody asks ""How is Ymir""..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Moakmeister,"Dang in any other show/movie/book, Ymir gaining the Titan power would have resulted in her escaping or freeing her people and improving her life, but instead it multiplied her suffering exponentially because she used it for her subjugators‚Äô whims, and after death she didn‚Äôt go to the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù afterlife, whatever that may be in AOT‚Äôs universe, but rather into a never-ending purgatory where she is compelled to laboriously, excruciatingly, sculpt huge beings from clay one bucket of water at a time for all eternity. Not even because she‚Äôs under mind control, but because being a slave was all she ever knew and she didn‚Äôt even think to disobey. 

Becoming a Titan was ENTIRELY a bad thing for her."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The73atman86,I would like to tell you guys a story about how dumb I am. I almost gave up on aot because I thought the ova episodes were just flashback episodes of the final season. I kept asking myself why the fuck am I watching these recruits again. I didnt realize I was in the wrong season until I checked the shows page on Crunchyroll. I blame Crunchyroll for going to a different season after watching a new episode

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheChrisLambert,"For those of us who watch on HULU, HULU kind of screwed with us. The info card was missing info that Crunchyroll included.

Here‚Äôs Crunchyroll:

According to legend, the Founder Ymir obtained the Power of the Titans when coming into contact,with something."" For generations, her blood and power were passed down by the Eldians. H√∂wever, the identity of that something which began it all remains, unknown. It may have been some fype of pathogehic parasite, a god who pitied the Founder Ymir and gave her power, or something else entirely."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SixStarStunna,So is Eren the giant Titan? And he is able to transform into that now because he now has the founding Titan power? Can someone please clarify for me lol

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bing603,The fact that Ymir makes the Titans makes so much sense to the first question I had about the anime. WHERE ARE THE DING DONGS.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SovacoDaCobra,It occurred to me that turning Titan inheritors into titans to pass down the Titan powers is actually a mercy because then they don‚Äôt have to experience cannibalism like Ymir‚Äôs daughters did.

Spoopsifer,SophJ94,"Ymir sent her messages in form of future memories asking Eren to come to ‚Äúrescue‚Äù her. That‚Äôs why he woke up crying. ‚ÄúTo You‚Äùmeans from Ymir to Eren.

But being a Timid person myself, it might not have taken much more than someone telling her that she's free and to stand up for herself like Eren did now to let her break out of it, at least long enough to Crush Fritz but it would seem for years of her slave life she never had anybody like that and she just continued to do the previous paragraph forever and whens someone finally came after what would have seen like an eternity to her to tell her that, of course she responded to Eren.

This kinda sounds like the plot of some Ecchi Romance.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gregfess,"If Eren just tore down all the walls and the wall titans started marching, I‚Äôd assume that many Eldians just died simply by being trampled on by the titans on their way to Marley :,("

lordNihilius,Pecuthegreat,cuz they like having two eyes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ModieOfTheEast,"The backstory of Ymir fit the theme of the narrative. But it also left me a bit confused and considering that we are now going into the final part of the story with Eren as the clear anti hero, I doubt we'll get real answers to it.

So, what I am puzzled about is the whole 9 titan shifter thing. Ymir never split her powers, so did that happen by ""accident""? Basically her first three daughter inherited a third of her ability? And then their daughters/sons inherited more that it became 9 in the end? But if they still ate each other everytime someone died why did it stop at 9 and not split even further down every time? Especially since it works in the way, that if someone of those 9 dies, someone completely different inherits the power (I guess it's the next born then, but they don't have to be directly related to the one that died as far as I understood it). 

Furthermore, the original Eldian people were not able to transform into Titans, only the descendants of Ymir did. But all of them were supposed to always eat their dead family members. So why is there even a difference between royal family and non royal family? Everyone is a descendant of Ymir after all? And it's not like there was potential inbreeding to keep the blood pure. I mean, Ymir's daughters were already not pure-blood anymore and they were only daughters, so the next descendant would be even less pure of blood. Did the original Ymir family split at some point and one half just stopped eating each other so the ""royal family"" was the one that ""kept the tradition alive""? But I guess in the end, this wasn't necessary either as Zeke was just royal blood (and he was half and half as well, so it doesn't seem like there needs to be pure blood to begin with to be considered royal). So when did a split happen and what was that split?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DogsAreFuckingCute,"Can someone explain why Eren saw the memories of the future in the moment he touched Historias hand?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Julonix," Not enough people are talking about that bug/parasite thing that gave Ymir the Titan powers. Wtf is that thing? If it‚Äôs a bug then how does it have so much power? Or maybe it‚Äôs an alien or something. I assume they‚Äôll explain.

Also the design of Erens new form is gross man. Isayama did great with it cause just looking at that thing scares me lol. It‚Äôs literally huge and has all those weird legs and spine and shit, just makes me shiver looking at it. Hard to think that it‚Äôs actually Eren"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IntuitiveBinks,"If Ymir has to build a titan from sand every time someone transforms, and has built every titan that‚Äôs ever existed after her, then it would make sense that Eren‚Äôs head sprouted that weird organism when he transformed because Ymir has never built a Founding titan, she was built by that organism.

Also, it looks like Ymir reverts back to her smaller childhood self in that realm. I think that‚Äôs because deep down she really was just a little girl when all of this started.

Just a very high theory"

lordNihilius,superdolmiosauce,Titans and the walls

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spoopsifer,the way eren tore his hands to break out of his chains was surprisingly one of the only scenes that has really made me squeamish
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kc0698,Man the people in AOT's world really like genocide huh?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mv3tt,So every eldians of the present time is a direct descendant of the union between king Fritz and Ymir?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deadpool-pikachu,"I‚Äôm kind of curious how they figured out it was the spinal fluid that contained the power. After all, he forced the kids to eat ALL of her. 

I‚Äôm also curious as to how there ended up being so many titan shifters if they all came from one."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Syphorce,This is the greatest anime I‚Äôve ever seen. They didn‚Äôt miss a detail. I wonder how long it took for this story to be written.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mean-Review10,Notice how Ymir died a slave and passed that on to the rest of her subjects Eren was the first one who yearned for true freedom regardless of what it takes
Mean-Review10,slurpycow112,"I think the Attack Titan has always yearned to rebel. The story (as we‚Äôre aware of it so far) started with Owl, who passed it to Grisha, then to Eren. They all had a part to play in rebelling against the Royal bloodline."
slurpycow112,Mean-Review10,I think all of them were influenced by Eren. The owl references Armin and Mikasa which is a sign that Eren has influenced his memories in some way. The rebel that Ymir needed was always Eren not the Attack titan in itself.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TriPod_DotA,Was it explained as to why spinal fluid is the way the titans are passed down? Still seems like a weird detail that could be prevalent somewhere
TriPod_DotA,illumantimess,The thing that attached to Ymir looked like a spine
illumantimess,TriPod_DotA,"That‚Äôs true. King fritz specifically called out spinal fluid when making the girls eat Ymir, so I didn‚Äôt know if it had to do with that or some other weird thing"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZiggyPalffyLA,Does Pyxis showing up in his human form during Eren‚Äôs PA announcement mean that the Eldians who drank Zeke‚Äôs juice were cured?
ZiggyPalffyLA,AMK2201,i didn't see him. I think you mean Shadis?
AMK2201,ZiggyPalffyLA,"Hmm maybe. Even if he wasn‚Äôt there, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense for Eren to also use his power to return them to normal?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AMK2201,"Although I've read the manga, the part with Ymir making the titans reminded me of this thing Muhammad Ali once said (I think it's from another source, but I just remember him saying it).

He said to imagine eternity in Hell as being as if you're in a long, endless desert. And you pick up a single grain of sand, then after a 1000 years you drop it, and pick up another grain, and the cycle repeats. 

You'd be in such a shit situation because first of all, there's A LOT of individual sand grains, and second of all, there's no way you could pick up every piece of sand because who knows if the one you pick up is one you've had picked up 1000s of times before."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zexyrr,"At the end of S4 Part 1 (I think), we see Eren tell Mikasa that he's always hated her because its in her Ackermann blood to follow orders (I may not remember this part perfectly). In the scene, he seems extremely sincere but we have seen recently that Eren will stop at NOTHING to protect those he cares for.

&#x200B;

What do we make of this scene? Why would he do this? Did he mean it?"
zexyrr,faded-noises,"I think Eren wanted to push away his friends because he knew they would oppose killing off nearly the entire population. Without anyone to stop him, it would make it easier for him to do what he believes is unfortunately necessary. He still cares and loves his friends."
zexyrr,plscallmeRain,"I've never bought into the idea of fate in this show. Before this season, I felt like the excuse was a lie but Eren was being honest about his hatred for everyone. I thought he hated everyone for forcing him to be a hero in a war where nobody can be a hero, but this season has made it clear he totally believes he is in the right.

That confuses me. Calling himself the same as Reiner doesn't make sense if we assume he believes he is totally right. He seems to be acting solely for himself and his own sense of justice, and he simply does not care about anything else. Maybe he thought telling his friends he hates them was the fastest way to get them to understand he no longer cared for them."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,usernames_ar3_hard,"What is the difference between the Royals and Eldians? Descendants of King Fritz + Ymir are Royals, but then who are the Eldians? 

Eldians are referred to as ""Subjects of Ymir"", which suggests that they are also descended from her. The Founding Titan can wipe Eldians' memories and control their biology, suggesting something similar. But if all Eldians are descendants of Ymir, wouldn't that mean they are all Royals too, because the only children she had were with Fritz? If Eldians are the race of people from which Ymir came, then why is it that the Founder can control them so much, but no one else?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrConor212,Started AoT 5 days ago and here I am. I‚Äôm addicted yo. Anyone recommend anime like this during the waiting periods?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Slightly_Wet_Peas,Hopefully people now realise why mappa is a significantly better option than wit for this season. Can you imagine pre season 4 cgi with that many big lads wandering around
Slightly_Wet_Peas,SophJ94,I much prefer Mappa art choice from Wit. It‚Äôs much darker and to me has more depth to it. It suits this season much better than Wit since the theme of this season is heavier
SophJ94,Slightly_Wet_Peas,Mappa's background art is criminally underrated as well
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PotatoPixie90210,"What the fuck is going on with streams, every single one is pausing, the site I use has stopped streaming it completely!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_crownseye,"I‚Äôm confused. Here‚Äôs some questions 

1) Okay so EVERY single Titan we‚Äôve seen so far was built by hand by ymir? How does the sand being used to make the titans correlate to shifters/subjects of ymir‚Äôs bodies turning growing larger and having larger organs/body parts,etc? 

2) where exactly is this coordinate place and what is the coordinate tree looking thing? Does it being in a desert have any meaning or is it simply to symbolise time?

3) in the pictures of Ymir standing with the devil, would that devil now represent the ‚Äúspine monster‚Äù or the king?

4) is the royal blood Ymir‚Äôs blood or that random asshole king‚Äôs blood?

Sorry for the number of questions"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nohastenowaste,Wow. The similarities between Ymir‚Äôs and Historia‚Äôs stories‚Ä¶ I got goosebumps when they showed Historia listening to Eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JOKER_SSR,Apparently Eren knows Talk No Jutsu too
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thejohnny345,"Dang, everyone hating on Erin in the comments.. I love this guy! He sticks to his guns! I‚Äôm wondering what Mikasa thinks about all of it. Is she with Erin?

thejohnny345,ShaidarHaran2,"Levi's thought of the Yeagers as a pain in his ass for a while now. But he's so completely out of it, and I don't think he can take a Titan being an Ackerman, that maybe his fate is only to wake up on whatever world this results in"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LavenderScented_Gold,"Did anyone else cringe when the king was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to reward you with my seed‚Äù? Yuck. 

Are we sure that OG Ymir and Scouts Ymir aren‚Äôt the same person? They both sacrifice them selves for folks that don‚Äôt care about them at all. OG Ymir just seems like a pushover where as Scouts Ymir has a bleeding heart personality.

They have to explain that spine fish thing because that did not explain anything at all."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aceeed,The BEST episode atm.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,minimiemi,So Ymir was originally a Marlyian who got kidnapped and enslaved by the Eldians or was she just from a random village?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Winners_84,Well Eren isn‚Äôt fucking about is he. Another fantastic episode.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Visualize_,"If you think about it, what Eren is doing isn't far off what actually happens in nature. For example, when two species of ants exist in the same environment, if one species is particularly predatory, they will just completely wipe out the other species. And to be fair, its not like they are just attacking unprovoked, the people of Paradis were living by themselves until Marley wanted to take the founding titan. My only question is if its entirely true that the whole world is against Paradis? Because if Marley could have allies I don't see why Paradis couldn't have allies as well"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,unperrubi,i would forgive you anything eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lyfeNdDeath,"The story just got so much deeper. Ymir's life and condition almost made me tear up, she spent her life as a slave and after her death spent 2000 years as a slave sculpting Titans, all alone. It just breaks my heart into million pieces. Then her daughters were forced to eat her corpse so she didn't even get respects after her death and her children has to go through that traumatising ordeal. 
When Eren reattached his head and started the Rumbling I got chills down my spine, it was a spectacular hellish sight, then Eren's declaration that he is going to commit the greatest act of mass slaughter imaginable I just didn't know what to think. It's kind of unfathomable how evil Eren is but we see from his perspective how it is necessary. The whole world wants the Eldian race to perish so Eren will make the whole world perish instead. This literally fits the African saying ""A child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel it's warmth""."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nuo66,Anyone catch the Symbolism of the crushed butterfly at the end of the opening and the someone letting the pigs loose causing a butterfly effect?
Nuo66,ShaidarHaran2,"A giant foot stomping a butterfly, probably more clear symbolism of his plan to trample the world."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lordofthekebabs,"now watch the opening again, carefully"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chronic_solitude,okay so i just realised something. mikasa is half ackermann and half azumabito right? but if that‚Äôs the case then why was eren able to address her in his speech to all the eldians via paths? it would mean that mikasa is also part eldian which would make sense cus there‚Äôs no way ackermanns or azumabitos would be able to live for so long without some of them dipping their toes in the proverbial eldian pool ykwim?
chronic_solitude,Beginning_Ball9475,"Ackermanns are a subset of Eldians. The whole schtick about the Ackermanns was that they were a bloodline that protected the Eldian Royal Family. They were hunted down because the vow renouncing war didn't apply to them. It's not really explained why it doesn't apply to them, but the theory is that Ackermanns were compelled to protect the king, but not necessarily obey him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,goatvoncrock,Does anyone have a wallpaper sized photo of the ending scene of Eren? Can‚Äôt find it anywhere
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fldg2114,Surprised we don't ever hear Ymir speak
fldg2114,AMK2201,They address this very early if you pay attention - her tongue got cut out along with the other townfolk who Fritz enslaves. So she can't speak. She can only scream as she does when she's running from the arrows.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lofikohai,I bet MadHouse is regretting their decision to drop AoT right about now.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sharkyboy292,I wanna see human Eren just chilling on one of the colossal titan's shoulders just casually riding them to Marley
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,grassisgreensoami,So founder titan was actually some moving spine?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StylePhoenix,Eren put his whole yeagussy into that founder titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,batsoupforall,Loved it but as a die hard zeke supporter/lover It broke me to see eren play mind games on him. At least he's till alive all things given.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"So global genocide is erens final plan, and now that he‚Äôs some bone creature that‚Äôs even taller than the colossal titan, he can carry that plan out. Anyone else kinda feel bad for the eldians not on paradise, seems like there gonna be caught in the crossfire between the world and a colossal titans foot."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdeQ217,"OMG, I got spoiled about the Rumbling and how Ymir got Titan powers but it was still amazing to see. But as always I have many questions:

-Wtf is that weird spinelike thingy, where did it come from and why did it give Ymir Titan powers ?

-How exactly did Ymir's power get passed down? I mean I guess that her daughters eating her makes sense but that would explain the shifters, what about Pure Titans, where did they come from?

-Wtf is going to happen now? There's no stopping Eren, is it? It seems like the entire world is doomed.

WHY ARE THESE EPISODES SO SHORT

Btw it was kinda heartwarming seeing Eren comfort Ymir like that.Though he was just manipulating her into getting what he wants and used her to commit a mass genocide, it was wholesome for like 4 seconds."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,karasinekofficial,le cumbling has arrived
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KillerKane455,"Eren going for the kills and not the objective, typical...loving it though"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pleiop,"It's been such a pleasure to watch this show. I can imagine people 20 years from now binge watching AOT wondering what it must have been like to see this all happen for the first time. 

Well, it's glorious. 

I never want this to end but I'm just happy that it happened."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shitsfuckedupalot,The fact there's an emphasis on sand and the obvious parallels with the protagonists makes me think the isayama was inspired heavily by Dune
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vertical_slabsociety,I‚Äôm not quite sure about the images of the eldians in the paths being still and the close up to eren face while talking.I guess even in the manga it wasn‚Äôt meant to be moving since Eren founding titan face don‚Äôt look like that but still it didn‚Äôt convince me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fethah,"Okay, so am I missing something with the royal bloodline now. They say only Eldians can become Titans, and it would seem it‚Äôs because they‚Äôd be direct ancestors to Ymir. So why aren‚Äôt all current Eldians royal blood then to a degree?"
Fethah,Beginning_Ball9475,"Yeah, the genealogy is a bit muddled there. Presumably it's the royal bloodline of Eldia that counts, not Ymir's blood, so the descendants of Karl Fritz's line, not the descendants of Ymir that dictate royal blood. So while Historia is a direct descendent of both the Royal Eldian House, and Ymir, Eren is a direct descendant of only Ymir and Fritz. So Historia and Zeke have the blood of the Royal Eldian family that was in control for 1850 years until the King renounced war and moved to Paradis, whereas every other Eldian ONLY has Karl Fritz as a very distant ancestor. Remember that Karl Fritz married and had a bunch of legitimate children that became the Royal House of Eldia. These are the ones that matter, apparently. Why Ymir would make that distinction seems kinda strange, because she only served Karl Fritz, not any of his children. The Ymir bloodline spread through her three daughters, and presumably at some point the descendants of these daughters (if they had any status/prestige to begin with) would have become the common people of Eldia and bred into the populace.

If it seems strange and arbitrary, it's the same in real life. IRL Noble houses have strange attitudes towards legitimacy, too. Even some cultures, for example, the Jews believe that Jewishness is inherited from the mother. If you have a Jewish father but a gentile mother, you're not Jewish, but if you have a Jewish mother but a gentile father, you're a Jew. Other people don't necessarily make this distinction of Jews, but the Jews do."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,"Okay, so this episode left me with questions (manga readers, if I'm not yet meant to know don't tell me)

1) Why did Ymir return to being a slave after obtaining the power of the founding organism? Is it really as simple as ""It was all she ever knew""? Because she clearly hated being a slave and didn't love her king. Why did she continue to serve the will of the royals while in the paths?


2) Based on how the coordinate tree grew three branches when her children ate her remains, and then grew many more branches when they had kids and their kids had kids, it seems like you could surmise that all subjects of Ymir are descendants of her and the king's children. So if that's the case, shouldn't all subjects of Ymir be royal blood, and therefore be able to use the founding Titans power?


3) The impression I got based on the name of the episode and the line Eren says to Ymir is that Ymir essentially reached out to Eren for help, and the dream he had as a child in the first episode was him connecting with Ymir. If Ymir is seemingly a slave to the will of the royals, with no will of her own while she wanders around in the paths, how could she have reached out to Eren and called him to her?"
DrPikachu-PhD,LilEscobarz,"1. One would assume that she actually loved the king, even if it sounds outrageous. Remember Ymir looking at the newly wed couple kissing? I think she was yearning for something like that. 

2. This part is a bit muddled, but I‚Äôm sure someone can explain it better than me. 

3. Ymir is not entirely dependent on the royal family, as we Eren was able to talk some sense into her. She clearly needs Eren for something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Leone_204,"So since Erin‚Äôs head got severed off (hence his centipede like Titan form) can he turn back into a human? Like is that something Titan power can heal? Also if Ymir is no longer making titans, can people still turn into titans like the og ones not the mindless ones."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JustJerry_,"My stupid ass reddit suspension finally ended and I first came here to tell you... Zeke was basically asking Ymir to erase the one thing that she contributed to the world (whether intentionally or not). If there were a time to make a choice of her own after eternity, it would've been then."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Odd-Block-2998,"Eren's logic before kissing Historia's hands: kill all the titans

Eren's logic after kissing Historia's hands: kill all the people

After so many years, Eren is still an illogical vengeful brat. Is this some adolescent rebellion period when going through puberty?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarkSora68,"Can somebody point me where to watch it? Crunchyroll doens't have it yet, nor does funimation, and Hulu isn't airing until 2:45. How are people watching the episode already?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lunarshock,I'm simply in utter awe of how this anime manages to surprise with what feels like every episode. Really didn't see that coming and super excited to see what comes next!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zachward16,I just want to say holy shit holy shit holy SHIT... that was awesome
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"This show has talked about cycles and history repeating multiple times. Now I‚Äôm thinking Eren is about to do, what we were under the impression of, actually happened to humanity with the Titans. I feel like there must be some connection."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sizlac-franco,"Can someone explain why all eldians are subjects of Ymir?

I get her children ate and multiplied, but theres no way theyd do that enough to populate like.. the entire eldian population. Whats more is only like specific titans are directly tied to her through the pass-down-by-eating-spine thing. So.. why do all eldians have a connection to Ymir?

If its explained later just say that and pls dont spoil."
sizlac-franco,illumantimess,Pretty sure they mentioned in an earlier episode about Eldian invaders forcing women to bear their children to multiply their numbers.
sizlac-franco,notsofriendlygirl,It was thousands of years ago. All it takes is one of the daughters to have sons and those sons can impregnate thousands.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OB-x-1,Any thoughts on what made Ymir listen to Eren? It would seem to me that Ymir might just hate civilization itself. She lived a sorrowful life and did not ask for this titan power. Also what the HELL happened to Eren's titan -- looks like Rod Reiss's titan.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mitchcout,"So the reason that only people with royal blood could use the Founding Titan was because Ymir  would only obey someone in that bloodline, since in her youth she was a slave to it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tyler980908,"This episode had to be one of the most disturbing, but so well done episodes. I loved how little dialogue there was during Ymir's backstory just creepy ambience basically. Eren freeing her was nice to see, the ending though made me gasp."

If Ymir got eaten, how did she also split into 9 specialty titans?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xxKEYEDxx,"What makes Royalty needed to activate the founder's power?  Because technically, all the descendants of Ymir are the blood of royalty."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Elehmiao,"If you want to be even more mindblown, go watch season 3 ending."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Giantranger49,"I was explaining to my white fiance how big Attack on titan is and why i needed to watch it right away cause of spoilers and she says ""Oh its asian Euphoria"" yes.. i guess lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thathatlookssilly,"Wait. So, Grisha didn't attack the royal family in the original time line?  And Eren saw a version of his future four years ago and decided to make changes?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rasmey_zun,10/10 ep
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spip721,so how how exactly did the nine titans come about? and where do pure titans come from?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yawgmoft,This show is going to need a Gundam Unicorn level trip through time healing all these wounds of cruelty for even the remote chance of a nice ending for anybody.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tuc94,The animation in this episode is just stunning the cgi really was a great call for this last season.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jolimark,So the Anime is going to be finished in three episodes?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joe7elmy,"Armin: ‚ÄúEren‚Äôs on our side! How could he not be?!‚Äù

Armin: ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SHADOWSTRIKE1,So‚Ä¶ Ymir *didn‚Äôt* make a pact with the devil to obtain the powers of the Titans?  That was just made up?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedditIsPropaganda84,"I haven't seen any comments about this, but its bugging me. What was the origin of the titan powers? Is it an angel? A demon? An alien?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CAI3O0SE,"Seeing ‚ÄúTo You, In 2000 Years‚Äù in 2014 and seeing this now is literally amazing. I love this show so much"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Toodope4kidz,Eren‚Äôs titan image at the end gave me chills.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rinmatsuokascythe,Did ymir guide eren?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShaidarHaran2,"What the fuuuuuck  
 
Now that's the way to do a protagonist flip reveal, take notes end of GoT. The imagery of his face on the black screen when he was talking, obviously likening this to a kind of devil. That was DARK.    
 
Ymir's life is so fucked up. Starts as a slave, may or may not have let loose a pig, takes the blame, falls into a tree, comes into contact with ""Something"", becomes a child concubine to the king forced to bear child after child, and after dying is chopped up and fed to those children. THEN, for reasons I'm not sure are clear (the kings wishes? Did the ""Something"" follow his command?) she's the one to build titans alone for an eternity, every single one a pain staking chore, every time one is formed, for 2000 years, which stretch to eternity where Ymir is, must have been millions of years building titans    
 
She seems entirely innocent in all this, but this extreme punishment of someone innocent creates a lot of righteous rage, and so she gave Eren the Founding Titan powers, in an amazing segment where it joined his severed head. I'm almost thinking of it like this is the culmination of her eternity of rage, her curse on the world 
 

Jesus tapdancing Christ with this show...I don't even know...."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Weezyweeb,"What if not only Eldians can turn into titans? I mean, judging by this episode it was a false rumour that the Eldians were 'blessed' with this power and Ymir's curse and all...maybe anyone who goes to that tree can transform"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fit_Inspector4290,"A second of silence for Ymir, who was waiting all this time in pain and suffering just to be the one to choose."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Stolen_Usernames,"It‚Äôs insane to see that Ymir built the walls herself, by hand. It‚Äôs unimaginable to think about how long she‚Äôs been trapped there. IMO this was the greatest episode of the entire series, crazy"
Stolen_Usernames,lyfeNdDeath,"Literally man, this single episode is greater than most anime series combined"
Stolen_Usernames,ShaidarHaran2,"She did pretty much nothing to deserve an eternity of punishment, building every titan in the wall but also every titan each time someone uses a shifter power, must have felt like millions of years 

 
Eren is like the culmination of her rage sent forwards through time to save her, while the attack titan can send memories backwards in time to get to this point"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZeShapyra,"After all this time it still makes me wonder what was going on in Yimirs lil' head to why she after getting the titan powers went back to the king and decided ""huh yes I am a slave, got my tongue cut out was abused, was hunted for funzies, they killed my village...I am gonna help this dude.""

I know she was mentally screwed but really..not a single cell in her head told her this is not a good thing, over the period of years, even like a year in before the kids even"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SucyUwU,"I just want to give Isayama some props for actually going forward with the idea of The Rumbling instead of just using it as a McGuffin (for those who don‚Äôt know it pretty much means using a plot device or object of appeal in order to trigger the story to go forward rather then actually using said plot device in the actual story) and pulling out right before it actually happens. 

Seen way too much media introduce some cool ass ideas and objects and cope out of it because the creators don‚Äôt actually know a good way to actually use it within the story"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NotHereFFF12,Eren: are you ready to RUMBLE?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hannelore300,I don‚Äôt understand why is Ymir so bounded to fritz after all even in Death?. Why is that Vow from Fritz so impactful to the holder of the founder titan in the end Ymir is making them obey to Fritz no?.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadZeus007,"So Eren calls Euthanising only Eldians to save the entire world a ""messed up plan"" and would never go along with it in a previous episode but flattening the whole word is somehow not messed up?

Many ppl in the world never did anything wrong..."
DeadZeus007,duder2000,"He thinks it's messed up because Zeke wants to inflict his nihilism on his entire people. Eren cares about Eldians (from Paradis) and wants them to be safe, Zeke wants them to vanish from the face of the earth.

On the other hand, Eren doesn't care about anyone who isn't from Paradis and has no qualms about crushing them with the rumbling - including the oppressed Eldians living in countries like Marley."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FancyFishFinger,So even the random eldians that got transformed into mindless titans were all built by ymir? I can not even comprehend the amount of time she really has spent in the sand realm. It would be interesting if someone tried to calculate it.
FancyFishFinger,slurpycow112,Time there is infinite yet instant. No fucking idea haha.
FancyFishFinger,AMK2201,yup. every titan she makes. she made all of those wall titans and it would've been painstaking af.

Danzo3366,AMK2201,chapter 122 (end of vol 30). ngl if i were you i'd just wait for the anime.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedditMemesAllDay,What volume + chapter is the start of this ep
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,drewmana,I‚Äôm still just giddy over the episode title
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LilEscobarz,Broo they couldn‚Äôt even be arsed to properly animate ‚Äúthat scenery‚Äù scene üò≠üò≠üò≠
LilEscobarz,ImRadicalBro,"Honestly it was still pretty gruesome in the episode, but of course we can never expect the same level of detail from the manga. They'd have trouble airing that shit lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,glidingtea,"was it explained in the anime how slave Ymir got to the paths after death? no manga spoilers pls.

Also, any other information on that parasite thingy? And the paths?

Anime only please"
glidingtea,LilEscobarz,"It‚Äôs going to be explained later on how she got into that realm. That parasite thing can be whatever you want it to be basically. It could be an alien, god or something else. Ymir just happened to come in contact with it and it granted her whatever she needed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nervous-Context,How many episodes do we have left?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Safe-Hugs43,Eren is in his Thanos bag
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,comrade-yuri,Anyone got any wacky end theories? It‚Äôs obviously going to be dark imo.
comrade-yuri,cybersidpunk,my theory is that colossal titans would reach the beach and drown while trying to cross the ocean.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rodukas,"I feel Ymir gave its life away (for the second time, 2000 years after the first time) after Eren's words. i believe it since we see Eren turned into this monster Titan with the vertebrae look of the original animal found in the water under the giant tree.

The parasite would change its host and leave poor Ymir alone."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,swivel-on-cheese,Can someone fill in a gap in my understanding. How and when did marley get hold of the various conscious titans?
swivel-on-cheese,hashmaroon,"unspecified, but it happened during the titan war when eldian families battled each other, whose chaos was exploited by the conniving marleyans. youre free to imagine what happened. i for one think that some marleyan officials got ahold of some titans and fed them to children they already brainwashed/allied with knowing marleys propensity to use child soldiers. but of course its likely more complicated than that, maybe some 1984 or game of thrones shit happened"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tripechake,"This is gonna be a long ass comment, so bear with me..

Since Eren controls the Founder‚Ä¶ is it possible for him to break the 13 year lifespan rule??

Also‚Ä¶ bouncing off that logic..
Is it possible for Eren to undo anyone that‚Äôs been turned into a Titan and just eradicate the ability for Edlidans to turn into titans or Titan shifters entirely?? Cause his goal from the first episode was to exterminate titans.. could he biologically alter Eldians to not be able to turn into titans??

Also, now that he officially controls the Founder, will he still need Zeke to access it, or was his little pep-talk with Ymir him breaking that rule too and now he can access its full power whenever he wants?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SeDefendendo88,I love how the will of king Fritz was such a big issue and Zeke found out how to nullify it and Eren didn‚Äôt need it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Grand-Awareness-7339,"Bro next Sunday is stack with media. AOT, Demon slayer s2 finale, super bowl and the long awaited Brazzers: Soapy Orgy featuring Nicole Anniston and Layla London!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Book_Of_Cain,"Ymir story is sad and all but I can‚Äôt help but feel like she is the biggest clown in the series. How tf do you get the power to become a Titan and the first thing you do‚Ä¶is go back to your slave owner. Then on top of that make him and his empire more powerful even going out your way to save his life. When all you had to do, at any point in time was transform and leave. Fucking moronic bruh, I have to be missing something lol. It would have made infinitely more sense if she joined Marley. The story isn‚Äôt bad btw, just Ymir‚Ä¶why?!?!"
Book_Of_Cain,ghumpoi,I think the point is that she has the mentality of a slave rather than an independent person.
ghumpoi,Book_Of_Cain,"Oh yeah definitely. It makes sense but still just so damn frustrating. She wasn‚Äôt even treated good after the fact she helped Eldia,  just knowing how much shit spiraled  down for the world and her own family is just painful, freedom was just a flicker away for her. I think this angle would have sat better with me if she was born a slave and it was all she knew. Hell, even now she‚Äôs being used smh"
Book_Of_Cain,udithsethu,She still has a slave mentality because of what she went through.
Book_Of_Cain,JessieN,Being a slave and a literal child may have played a part
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"I think we‚Äôre going to get a code geass ending now because eren is still sane clearly, but he‚Äôs setting himself up as a villain. I think it will be like the story lord Tybur told. No idea who will be the hero, but I‚Äôm betting on Gabi. She‚Äôs still Human just like the story Lord Tybur told, and she‚Äôs basically eren. 

Even if we don‚Äôt get that ending I‚Äôm pretty sure eren will die just based off what Commandant shadis said:

[‚ÄúAnd you (Eren), just like your father wanted, chose to set your life ablaze, and let it burn to ashes outside the walls.‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/fqK84Fr.jpg)"
Johnny20022002,666JFC666,"I think if anybody manages to stop Erin it'll be Falco somehow, I doubt they just made him a Titan and had him eat a shifter for no reason"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnselLovesNuts,Did king fritz fuck that little girl?
AnselLovesNuts,uelizage,He gifted her his seed yes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AbaramaGolding,The way Eren was holding Ymir was so heart warming. She has probably never been held like that before.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jolimark,To me its astounding how we're still cheering on Eren who basically is and has been a psychopath mass murderer. Already in S2 when fighting Annie he probably killed so many innocent children whilst destroying the inner city. And now he is leading on a mass genocide the size of which barely any story has ever seen.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JoshTeck64,INB4 The pigs that ate Grisha‚Äôs sister are descendants of the pigs that were freed.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,N_godj_N,"It seems that no one is noticing, or at least I didn't see it getting noticed, but I believe the OG King of the island was actually the King and not a Userper, as we previously thought. 

If you think about it, what King would ever resign his throne to the children of the slaves he owns, even if they were powerful weapons. I believe that's the reason they couldn't erase their families memories and the other royals + the king's personal guard's memories. It's because what slave would ever have the power to do so.

Also, I think the rumbling isn't what we thought it was. It was never meant to defend them or to be used as a threat. It was meant for Ymir's revenge against the world, because if you think about it, not only has she been a slave for the amount of years numbers cannot express, but she's also seen all her people's suffering.

Plus I don't think we should call them eldians from now on. The eldians are just fucking degenerates who abused Ymir and the Subjects of Ymir. If you think about it, everyone has been doing so. The marlians, the royals in eldia and the whole world. There has't been a point in history where her people have been free, which is why the Rumbling is her revenge upon the whole world.

I don't even think Eren wants it to happen, but he saw Ymir's memories and all her Subjects' suffering, and both him and Ymir decided that's the only way.

Mad fucking story. From just one episode so much shit came to light, it's not even funny."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GeoTech84,"So if every Eldian is a descendant of Ymir and king fritz, doesn‚Äôt that mean every Eldian is a descendant of royal blood?? I thought zeke and historia were unique in that aspect, but doesn‚Äôt this last episode show as that every single Eldian is of royal descent also? I‚Äôm confused"
GeoTech84,gwmckeon,No the eldian‚Äôs are pretty much everyone that fritz has subjugated.
gwmckeon,GeoTech84,But isn‚Äôt everyone on Paradis a descendant of Ymir? An Eldian that has the ability to be turned into a titan due to their ability being passed down from her and Fritz?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Atomicmonkey1122,"Damn, what a wild ride

I know better than to try and predict this show. But with Eren going wild and basically becoming the Bad Guy, there are three ways I can see this ending. 

1, the Scouts and etc turn on Eren and defeat him. They are sad but understand that, uh, murdering the entire world isn't a great idea. Most people on earth survive. 

2, Eren successfully kills everyone outside Paradis, making the people (who used to be ) within the walls the only humans that survived. might have to erase some memories while he's at it. Right back to square one except without titans probably

3. Eren wins but AT WHAT COST? Kills a bunch of Eldians and friends. Maybe everyone ever since I feel like a lot of Eldians would oppose his idea. And he Realizes he went too far. I'm thinking like Devilman levels of chaos and depression and world-ending

I like 1 and 3 best. I feel like 1 isn't very likely, though. 

But again its impossible to predict this series so I'm guessing the real ending will be some wild shit that came out of nowhere but somehow makes sense"
Atomicmonkey1122,chillwithwill,I think your #1 is entirely possible and the biggest tragedy of all would be someone like Mikasa having to deliver the final blow
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,electrorazor,"Incredible episode but I'm still so confused. Titans only exist cause Ymir built them out of sand. Now because of Eren does that mean no more new Titans??? Why would Ymir continue to build them if she no longer listens to royal blood.

And what even counts as royal blood, since everyone is a descendant of King Fritz. Does it go by eldest daughter? If that's the case shouldn't most of the population have royal blood? This doesn't make much sense. How could you even tell who's royalty after 2000 years of reproduction.

Also what's the whole deal with Titans needing sunlight to regenerate. Why can Ymir only build Titans in sunlight. Does she require solar energy, is it related to the water bug thing.

What are the 9 Titans? Did Ymir's granddaughters eat her children resulting in more intelligent titans? If so why didn't they keep doing so. Would the process work only so many times before Ymir's powers were spread out too thin? Or did they just stop eating Titan Shifters' body for no reason. If three people ate Eren's body, would they all inherit each of his three titan powers? Also why does the power pass down to a random Eldian if they aren't eaten"
electrorazor,bluebell135,Hope more things get explained ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,glidingtea,"Wait, did Ymir actually have the power to make all Eldians infertile?   
I thought she only make sand titans?"
glidingtea,LilEscobarz,"Every Eldian is connected to the Founder. Ymir can literally do anything she wishes to an Eldian, including changing their biology"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,No_Championship_5162,Crazy how many oriole here think it‚Äôs morally more correct for Eren to kill everyone in the world that‚Äôs not Eldians. But think it‚Äôs evil to stop Eldians from having babies. My mind is blown. Y‚Äôall are psychos
No_Championship_5162,Visualize_,And what exactly is the morally superior option here?
No_Championship_5162,cybersidpunk,"people of paradis where out of the game and weren't bothering anyone but the world outside the wall got greedy and started to attack them for the ice burst stone and titan powers. they didnt care about the people of paradis and also ignored the warning of the king about the rumbling. 

if you hit a bees nest knowing full well they are going to come out and sting you, the morally correct choice here isnt to make all the bees not have stings but to not just bother them in the first place.

also even if they euthanized them do you really think marlay and the world would have believed them? they would have been like we have to kill them to make sure."
No_Championship_5162,zzxxccbbvn,I mean what other options are there?
zzxxccbbvn,Broseidonathon,"The test rumbling was still on the table. Use a small portion of the Wall Titans to scare the world and keep them from attacking long enough for Paradis to modernize and build traditional defenses. Then they could have started trading with the outside world. Given the fact they allegedly sit on a large amount of natural resources, this would have probably been the best option for them in the long run too.

A lot of people would have died so not really a ‚Äúmorally right‚Äù option, but it would have mostly been politicians and military leaders who weren‚Äôt exactly innocent."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mean-Review10,I truly can‚Äôt understand how anyone who‚Äôs seen how Eldians have been enslaved and imprisoned there whole existence can think Eren is wrong for wanting to fight for there ultimate freedom
Mean-Review10,Resh_IX,Cause it make sense to kill all the hundred million other Eldian‚Äôs outside the walls right? Their freedom isn‚Äôt that important just Paradis.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sukeshram7,"I mean, where are all the citizens of paradis right now? Are they underground? How are they gonna withstand the collossal Titans themselves?"
Sukeshram7,jolimark,Dying I assume
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jbowyerjr,"bruh how are people defending eren, he is literally enacting mass genocide on the entire world except for a small island of people??"
Jbowyerjr,cybersidpunk,not defending but i understand him. people have been ok with wiping out paradis for no other reasons than greed and power. if he doesn't do this his island is going to be destroyed and loved ones killed so there is no other way left.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,boog1evilleUSA,Why do yall bomb breaking bad on imdb
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mean-Review10,Completely team Eren Elydian freedom is taken not given
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bingumarmar,So where is Historia?
bingumarmar,AMK2201,you saw her at the end when Eren spoke to all subjects of ymir. she's literally there lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UrfriendGomer," Now that the walls are gone, I‚Äôm hoping for a rendition of Vogel Im K√§fig. Perhaps Vogel aus K√§fig. Not fluent but please I‚Äôm hoping for another banger"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TyTheHusky,"Okay so I might be stupid but I‚Äôm trying to keep track of where all 9 of the original titans are right now. I think attack, founding, and warhammer are all Eren and Falco is Jaw. But where/who are the other 5?"
TyTheHusky,SoKawaiii,"Annie is the female titan, Reiner is the armored titan, Armin is the colossal titan, Pieck is the cart titan, Zeke is the Beast titan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,glidingtea,"I'm confused.   


She was being hunted and found the tree, then became a titan.  
So...she came back to slavery after that?"
glidingtea,AMK2201,"Basically, when you think of a slave, she was a really loyal slave. It sounds fucked up, but getting the power gave her a purpose and more interest from the King. It's like working in a shithole company, but getting noticed by the asshole boss. They suck, but at least you're noticed compared to the other slaves"
AMK2201,illumantimess,Also I feel like people really are glossing over the fact that she‚Äôs a traumatized child.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Different-Ad3276,I don't like that all this has happened because of a single parasite hiding inside a tree. Is it only me?
Different-Ad3276,LilEscobarz,"It‚Äôs perfect. 2000 years of misery and oppression happened because Ymir accidentally came into contact with this being, and not because she made a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with the devil. 

It goes back to what Kruger was saying; that there are no gods or devils, just what people choose to believe in. The origin of the titans were never that important to begin with, it‚Äôs the use of the power that was the problem"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KapsylofferVR,Funny how the character with a Turkish name carries out a genocide. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gregfess,"Wait, when annie got pulled to the coordinate, do you think she was still in her cacoon?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FamiliarSprocket,Can someone explain how Mikasa heard Eren's message at the end? Aren't the Ackermanns not eldian?
FamiliarSprocket,TypicalPnut,she's not fully an Ackerman
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Dope_Pineapple_,This episode gave me Berserk vibes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LezTalkz,Does this mean Erens message to Eldians reached even the Eldians over in Marley?
LezTalkz,fuckmeinthesoul,Yeah it was clearly shown
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,math_salts,Why couldnt Mikasa hear Armin???
math_salts,skexz,Because of the sound of hundreds of colossal titans walking
math_salts,the_little_engineer,Because the RUMBLING was happening right behind them. Aka an extremely large rumbling sound of 1000s of titans
the_little_engineer,math_salts,I get that but it just seemed like a weird thing to focus on.
math_salts,illumantimess,Have you ever been to a concert or club and had to lean into a person‚Äôs ear for them to hear you?
illumantimess,math_salts,"Yeah I get that, but it just seemed like a weird thing to focus on."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Odd-Block-2998,"Prediction: Mikasa, Armin, Jean, Conny, Hange, Levi (should still be alive), Annie (after waking up - no a spoiler due to opening), Reiner, Falco (after becoming back a human), Gabi, Pieck, and Pieck's boss co-operate to find a plan to kill Eren. Zeke should already be dead (after getting crushed by Founding Titan's transformation), and Yelena most probably will die soon doing something stupid (most probably getting eaten by a pure titan).

Eventually, Annie ""suplexes"" Eren, Levi kicks Eren, Armin and Falco talk Eren into sense, and Mikasa finally kills Eren.

Note: I do not read manga, just thinking that Eren is the bad guy now and should be killed. And Mikasa should be the best person to do so."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DisastrousMacaron325,"TBH, fuck Ymir. And fuck Frieda Reiss too, for calling her actions ladylike and smth to be emulated."
DisastrousMacaron325,ShaidarHaran2,">And fuck Frieda Reiss too, for calling her actions ladylike and smth to be emulated.


This is nearly 2000 years separated from actual Ymir, all she knows is a story of a story of a story hundreds of times over. Eldians make it sound good, Marley makes it sound bad, it's effectively belief at this point."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,glidingtea,"Was it ever revealed in the Anime why there are 9 special titans?  
And are the rumbling titans colossal titans?"
glidingtea,kiddark25,Yeah they are. I think they‚Äôll reveal more about Ymir offspring and how there are 9 special titans
kiddark25,glidingtea,Is the colossal titan special if there are multiple copies?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flame1626,What did the mid episode card say about the primordial centipede thing?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SteveStacks,Where's the fucking episode crunchy roll
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nietzschean_horse,This episode gave me a similar feeling to Berserks eclipse
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"So eren now has complete control of all of the foundings powers, so how is anyone on paradise supposed to stop him. He‚Äôs not held back by any vow so he could do anything to anyone of them at any time if they tried to intervene with his plan of global genocide. Guess they‚Äôll just have to sit and watch, hoping the alliance in marley has some sort of plan for taking out hundreds of thousands of colossal titans. 


They did show off that plane in season 4 part 1, so maybe they‚Äôll bring that back and drop bombs on the napes of the colossals? Tho even if they did I find it hard to believe they‚Äôd have enough of them prepared for all those colossals."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Diavolo__,Makes no sense why ymir would go back and be subservient to the king even after she pretty much gains the power of a god. I feel bad for her but she chose slavery
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ze-Bruh,"Jesus seeing Grisha kill the Reiss was BRUTAL.

But Im pissed because they didnt animate Erens Founding Titan at the and, they just slapped a drawing there and that threw me off"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"Why does Eren‚Äôs Titan look different now?

I mean, we didn‚Äôt get a clear view of him‚Ä¶ but he just seems to be some gigantic skeleton worm now.  Not sure why."
SHADOWSTRIKE1,The-Invincible,"
Because he has the fk Founding Titan power now

Did you watch the episode?"
SHADOWSTRIKE1,Visualize_,Because he accessed the powers of the founding titan. Did you not see the part where that same alien thing that touched Ymir connected to Eren's head after it got shot off.
SHADOWSTRIKE1,ShaidarHaran2,"I guess there's a big difference between having the shifter power in him, but not being of royal blood and thus not being able to use it, only in sparks when he touches someone of royal blood like Dina or Historia.  
 
But this time is different, this is the founder Ymir agreeing to give him the full blown power of the Founding Titan despite not having royal blood, she chose to give it to him because he said he could end it, this is the full Founding Titan power which he didn't have before."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lucrum15,I thought at one point we were told Ymir made a deal with a god or entity for the titan power. Am I misremembering that or perhaps confusing it with some other media? Also where do the 9 shifting titans fit into this origin?
Lucrum15,Johnny20022002,"Yes it was said she mad a contract with the devil of all earth. We still don‚Äôt know where the 9 Titans are actually from. There‚Äôs an explanation given, but as you‚Äôve just seen the characters of the show are not reliably accurate. Grisha‚Äôs father says her spirit split into the 9 Titans upon her death."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UniqueElectron,I‚Äôm confused where the 9 came in. Seemed like ppl in the lineage could eat their parents to gain titan power and those looked more like the ones from inside the wall. How did it get down to the 9 uniques with special abilities & just the mindless ones.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Brown_batman_,Sorry if I missed this part. how can Ymir make all Eldian‚Äôs sterile?
Brown_batman_,ImRadicalBro,She has the power to do whatever she wants to Eldians.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Deadinthehead,I thought ymir got her powers from a deal with the God?
Deadinthehead,ImRadicalBro,That's the story according to legend. What we saw was what actually happened.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DougGTFO,"Geez for as slow as the last few episodes have gone, I thought for sure it wasn‚Äôt gonna happen until the next episode or two. That ending was awesome."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Trenvilla,I am with Eren 100%.  We thought that the walls protected the only humans in season 1.  I am ok with them still being the only humans on earth.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pecuthegreat,"Anyway, that Marlean that killed Ymir was based and awesome. It would be great to watch a short series on the subjugation of Marley by Eldia with that guy as the main character."
illumantimess,MrChica,She died 13 years after gaining the power you are right on that

z-moneyz,LilEscobarz,"The last shot of the episode is his real face, not the founding titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MonsterCookies8,Ngl the Titan origin story was disappointing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maddogkaz,"Were parts of Ymir's backstory skipped that were in the manga? Because it seemed to be rather empty and lacking to me. Also why did Ymir get ultimate power and then return to being a slave to the man who burned down her village killed her family cut out her tongue and had her hunted for sport?

I scanned the comments here and people said it was Stockholm syndrome but that's bullshit she never even interacts with the king until the moment he decides to have her hunted and killed. I always assumed she served the royal blood out of some kind of magic bullshit hence the ""curse"" of Ymir. There better be a real reason for her still being a slave or I'm gonna be questioning the  writing in this section a lot."
maddogkaz,cybersidpunk,it was exactly the same in the anime as it was in the manga.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gogoatee,how do you guys watch it right now? i see you talking about it  but i cant find the episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lunchbag-mermaid,"Some questions as although I‚Äôve watched countless videos understanding the early days of Ymir etc. I can‚Äôt remember most details for the life of me. 

Are people in Marley also subjects of Ymir? Is that why Eren was able to communicate with them? What lies were the people in Marley told that made them hate Paradis? And why did people of Paradis not know about Marley but the people of Marley knew about Paradis? Ahhh I cannot remember

what was the purpose again of having everyone‚Äôs memories wiped? What memories were removed? Was it how the walls were built?

Also does Ymir want the same thing as Eren then? To kill everyone outside of Paradis? And why?"
lunchbag-mermaid,Lhorious,The other people wasn't Marley. Those are Eldians from all over the world.
lunchbag-mermaid,K_2Smooth,"Yes, Eren was able to communicate with some of those that reside Marley because SOME are Eldians. Whatever things Willy Tybur preached about are probably the lies the people of Marley were told. Marley knew about Paradis because unlike the people within Paradis, Marley didnt have a ruler who had the ability to consistently wipe their minds of their history+the outside world lol. As for your last question im not answering ive read the manga lol"
lunchbag-mermaid,MapleJacks2,"Eren was communicating to the Eldians *in* Marley.

King Fritz (from 100 years ago) made the walls and the bunch of Eldians moves there. He made those Eldians forget but everyone outside the walls remembered.

King Fritz wanted to atone for all the atrocities the Eldian Empire committed, so he built the walls as a refuge where Eldians could live without hurting others. He wiped their memories to presumably stop them from wanting to leave or seek revenge.

My guess is that Ymir is tired of serving the Royal Family, having Eldians die, and having to constantly build titans.. That's probably not it though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,Someone convince me that it makes sense for there to be a royal blood line if all subjects of Ymir descended from the children of Ymir and king Fritz.
Johnny20022002,_saengdao,"there‚Äôs no definite answer for it but the theory is the current royal family are descendants from sina, who had the least amount of children out of ymir‚Äôs daughters. the royal family is also judged by who can properly hold the founding titan, which isn‚Äôt everyone. every royal is a subject of ymir, but not every subject of ymir is or can be royal."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,slingshot91,Anime-only here: Why exactly did Ymir stay a slave for so long even when she was the most powerful being? Will this be addressed?
slingshot91,fuckmeinthesoul,"It's not about she *could* do, it's about what she was *willing* to do."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Darth_Peverell,"Question: After Ymir got the power of the Titans, why did she continue being a slave to Fritz? Why didn't she kill him and his army?"
Darth_Peverell,fuckmeinthesoul,Because she didn't have the will to do it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,real_Lejon_Brames,Can someone explain why was Ymir a slave even in life? Was she so ‚Äúweak minded‚Äù that she never had a will of her own? Why would the biggest titan (except Erens) be controlled by a human King who cant hurt her in any way?
real_Lejon_Brames,Nanokye19,Trauma and slave mentality. She was just a kid she probably had no idea as to even how to over power them and what she would do with her life after
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SyncOut,"So if every single Eldian that can transform into Titans is descendant from Ymir, doesn't that mean everyone is technically royal blood?"
SyncOut,fuckmeinthesoul,"Yes, so it's either the amount of it that matters, or (most likely) Yimir should *see* you as a member of a royal family for you to be one."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bruhhhh_123,"Why Eren does so much to touch Zeke, can't he just touch Historia and do the same thing? She is royal too"
Bruhhhh_123,Ladlow,I think the royal blood needs to also be a titan to access the founder.
Bruhhhh_123,IzziTheEpic,"He was able to use the founder to see memories while touching Historia‚Äôs hand but since she isn‚Äôt a titan he couldn‚Äôt use the full power. She could have been made into a titan to use the full power, but that would have killed her in 13 years, the baby, and she would inherit King Fritz‚Äôs memory, essentially changing her forever and making her bound to the loyal vow of pacifism. Also she would have had to eat Armin, or have had to capture one of the other shifters and eat them. They do discuss this option in season 3, I just don‚Äôt remember the episode."
Bruhhhh_123,zexyrr,I'm sure someone more qualified will respond to this too lol but I think it has something to do with her being pregnant and that using her to control the Founding would damage her in some way?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rafins07,"Ok i loved everything, but if eren's dad didnt want him to win why did he give him the attack titan anyways? I mean if he knows what he will do in the future and doesnt like it, why not not do it? Makes sense right?"
Rafins07,invincibilityframes,"Kinda a paradox, if he hadn‚Äôt given eren the titan then eren could‚Äôve never convinced him to take it. Maybe that‚Äôs why he begged Zeke to stop eren"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ennyeurope,"I keep seeing 'eren freed ymir'. Im confused . Isnt she still stuck in the path dimensions having to make titan bodies? Like for example if armin is to transform, wouldnt she make the titan?"
ennyeurope,Johnny20022002,"Actually good point. If Eren really freed Ymir then no one should be able to access their Titans forms again. 

Now I‚Äôm confused by who was building ymirs body when she transformed into a Titan? Did she access the paths and built it herself. I suppose that would make sense."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wezbo132,RUMBLING RUMBLING
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Agnostic_Pagan,"So wait, when did Ymir create the other intelligent Titans then?"
Agnostic_Pagan,Johnny20022002,According to what we know so far Ymir‚Äôs spirit split into the 9 Titans.

Or, alternatively, they will dispose of that weapon because they don't want others to use it, or are too scared of using it themselves. Either way, Eldians are fucked."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HeyBlame,"If the three daughters that are Ymir were also the king‚Äôs daughters that would mean they had royal blood.

I‚Äôm just confused as to how there‚Äôs a specific royal blood line and it hasn‚Äôt been dispersed throughout all individuals who are able to transform to Titans (all eldians)."
HeyBlame,ShaidarHaran2,"Same way royal blood works in real life, the King's true legal descendants are royals, Ymir's are just bastard children that become normal Eldians. She answers to the direct line of the King, that is until Eren breaks the chain."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lightsabersarecool,Is that King Fritz the same one who put the walls up started and ended the great Titan war ?
lightsabersarecool,fuckmeinthesoul,"No, it's was his descendant who built the walls. Also, I'm not sure if the same person both started AND ended titan war, I always thought it was kind of a multi-generational thing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TyrantRex6604,"Ok, out of context but this question had been in my mind for times: what definites of [royal blood]?

First generation titan (1): Ymir

Second generation (3): Maria, Rose, Sina (ymir x king fritz)

Third generation (at least 9)  (y/k+???)

Fourth+ generation: ???

You see, the third generation of titan wielders extermite other races and history, then force the victims to breed children for them. But problem is, they're not only descendents of ymir, but king fritz as well. There's 2 definition that i could think of, but i cant even convice myself

i) inbreeding: the titan wielders not only make children with prisoners of war, but also make children with other descendent of king fritz (by fritz's other wifes)

ii) ymir having children with other people: this is the most unlikely point. How can a slave like ymir get with other men? Plus, she's actually in love with fritz, i doubt that she'll cheat on fritz

So, any 1000iq person can explain this to me?"
TyrantRex6604,Kandoh,"Royal blood is anyone descended from King Fritz and Ymir. This gives you access to special Titan powers.

**Any** member of the Eldian tribe can turn into Titans, however. You just need spinal fluid from someone with royal blood and a trigger.

Thegood1saregone,Envy_onTHE_Toast,I don‚Äôt have it right in front of me but it essentially said Ymir gained the power of the titan by coming in contact with ‚Äúsomething‚Äù. And that the thing was possibly a god or a parasite or something else. It was pretty ambiguous but I guess it shows that even in universe they don‚Äôt totally know the origins

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GuerreroNeeK,I‚Äôm confused what happened to Levi? He was the best character. And also how did ymir and eren get powers? They just got touched by some centipede thing?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Glockonyoface,i just realised 2000 years in real life would be really long in the paths that‚Äôs sad as hell
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ok_Economist9774,Eren still did nothing wrong.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SphmrSlmp,"Zeke: ""We need to euthanize the Eldian race""

Eren: ""I get where you're coming from. But how about we euthanize everyone else instead?"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TankBoys32,That still shot of Eren at the end in his titan form looked straight out of Berserk.. a total holy shit moment

###NEW EPISODE SPOILERS BELOW

###MANGA READERS INSTEAD HELP PROTECTING ANIME ONLIES FROM SPOILERS BY REPORTING SPOILERS IN THIS THREAD!"
ProfessorRigby,KrZ120,Mangekyojin Sherengan
ProfessorRigby,lisbethslander,Mangekyo Sharingan...ssssswoooshhh.
Zelcariaaa,EliteAssassin750,"We'll probably see next episode but I'm thinking he chose to be under the residence because it would be easier to break through when he transformed. Another building could have crushed him in, maybe? And it was behind the stage too. 

I don't believe they would get rid of Reiner and Falco that way but the other residents, necessary sacrifices? 

Man, I can't wait for next ep"
Zelcariaaa,ZaHando10,"A titan user doesn't necesserally have to turn into a full titan all the time. For example eren has turn into half titans during experiments and when armin and mikasa was going to die. I belive they can choose to only change a portion of their body if they really want to. So reiner could have turned into a half titan form and save falco. We will have to wait until next time. But hey, thats, just a theory, an anime theory, thanks for reading. And yes he just willingly killed all those people."
Zelcariaaa,blubat26,"I doubt they're dead. I think Reiner probably tried to partial transform and shield Falco, at the end you cold see him moving to Falco in a protective motion. Maybe try and use the damage done to him by Eren transforming to at least save the kid."
edwardsamson,Twindo,"Yeah I think with training, Titan shifters can wound themselves and delay the transformation probably by resisting the pain or urge to protect themselves. We‚Äôve seen Reiner and Berthold do this on the wall after Mikasa cut them."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ahmed_Umar,"""I just keep moving forward"""
Ahmed_Umar,ProfessorRigby,"He said that to Reiner while picking him up, just like Reiner said to keep moving forward while picking him up in the past."
ProfessorRigby,KayabaAkihikoBDO,That makes me feel a lot better about it. I know Erens just doing what‚Äôs best but it felt kind of rude hahaha now to know he did the same to him I get it.
Ahmed_Umar,LucHendriks2003,"""until i have crushed my enemies"""
Ahmed_Umar,DrHorrible10,Eren is a Kids See Ghosts stan confirmed.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ahmed_Umar,"Thank God Eren attacked after Willy Declared War, otherwise it'd have been a War Crime."
Ahmed_Umar,novuskai,he's a whole terrorist though...
Ahmed_Umar,Positive_Magician_52,I mean he did blow up a building full of civilians so we put a check mark on the war crime box anyway.
Ahmed_Umar,swans183,That‚Äôs some impeccable timing to avoid the whole ‚Äúpre-emptive strike‚Äù argument
swans183,blubat26,"I think it was deliberate. Eren could transform whenever, but he explicitly listened to the play and awaited the declaration of war."
swans183,DuelingPushkin,It wouldn't have even been a preemptive strike. Marley has been conducting an undeclared war against Paradis for decades by besieging their city with an endless flood of titans.
Ahmed_Umar,MitsukiKazen,"no actually his transformation went from terrorism to war crime *because* of the war declaration

regardless of willy's status, eren do be killing most of the civilians in that building üò≥"
MitsukiKazen,RedRocket4000,He can't be a terrorism unless he no longer a member of Paradis military. And plenty of legitimate targets at that gathering so it not an act of terror. You can still argue it's a war crime as it Erin is not in uniform which is a war crime and you can argue the attempt to avoid civilian casualties not adequate.
Ahmed_Umar,Thevoidawaits_u,"Pradis residents know that the breach was ordered by the Marlying army, so a the war began way before the declaration.

I think it's game theory move signaling Marly and the other nations that declaration of war will lead to retaliation so the nation will think twice before engaging with pradis."
Ahmed_Umar,Takingtheehobbits,Why? They already declared war on Paradis island when they broke the walls and let the Titans in.
Ahmed_Umar,PK_RocknRoll,...then proceeded to become a war criminal by killing civilians
PK_RocknRoll,LeJew92,"As opposed to Marleyan warriors destroying shiganshina and trost, and all the land inbetween which was populated almost exclusively by civilians... as far as paradis is concerned they have never not been at war with Marley since the wall fell. Additionally Eren did wait until the entire world declared war on them to transform. It didnt seem like a single soul there (civilian or not) was opposed to paradis genocide. If anything Eren's actions could even seem...restrained in comparison"
Ahmed_Umar,arad156,that was literally what he was waiting for
Ahmed_Umar,luckiestlooserofever,I think trashing an internment zone would count as a war crime anyway. That's why the meeting was there in the first place
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AlenJJ,"The whole episode was just sick. How they animated it all. The music fit perfectly and gave me incredible goosebumps. Eren the cold killer again. I'm looking forward to the fight against the war hammer. The whole Episode my mouth was wide opened and I was speechless, it was perfect! üòº"
AlenJJ,77Dawson,"Man, you could not have summed up my reaction to this episode any better."
AlenJJ,lisbethslander,Esp when they showed the big collosal titans forming the walls...sick!
AlenJJ,sptprototype,"There were moments I actually had my mouth hanging open or audibly said ""holy shit"" to myself. This episode is a perfect example of how narrative pay off, meaningful exposition, and dramatic tension can be just as satisfying as flashy fight sequences. One of the best episodes of anime I have ever seen"
sptprototype,The_Foren,Seriously dude. It was all dialog but i was glued the entire episode. The intensity was unreal
AlenJJ,Dovaldo83,"The part that has kept me so engage with AoT is how well it builds mystery and then reveals that mystery in a very controlled but satisfying pace. We got some historic bombs this episode concerning the king and the warhammer titan, but there are still burning questions I'm eagerly awaiting the answer to."
AlenJJ,onlyforshadyshit,"Exactly. I saw a slight drop in MAPPAs quality over WIT which concerned me, but had hope since AoT has always been vastly better at its payoffs then its buildups. No doubt from here on out Season 4 will be üî•."
AlenJJ,allycakes,I loved how the music gradually built through the whole episode. It added to the tension. Perfection.
AlenJJ,WingedBeing,"The music throughout, that building piano in particular, reminded me strongly of the music in S6E10 of Game of Thrones when Cersei was getting ready for some aggressive separation of church and state. It kept me on edge and told me something big was coming, but it kept my mind racing as to what that would be."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,"GG Willy Tybur, imagine getting chomped in the same breathe that you declared war lmao."
Clumulus,OOM-32,Spawnkilled lmfao
OOM-32,Clumulus,"""lmao sit noob"""
Clumulus,nariz1234,A ''you have chosen death'' moment if there ever was one.
nariz1234,TestaRossa95,"For real, especially [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QH4FGy6_HY&t=1m53s):

1:58

Willy: ""And that is because we are born into this world"" 

Eren: Ok, let's see where's he going with this.
 


2:20

Willy: Please join us ...

Eren: (resigned smile) You nearly had me going there."
Clumulus,chanj3,"LMAO! best element of surprise tactic right there the moment you declare war! 

Willy Tyburn: I, hereby, declare war on EREN YEAGER!

Eren Yeager: **YOU RANG?!?**"
Clumulus,Shaponja,FIRST BLOOD! (of the declared war)
Clumulus,jostheholywagon,Instant karma
Clumulus,Sterling-Archer-17,Haha this was my thought too‚ÄìI can just imagine Eren thinking ‚ÄúTybur wants a war? He‚Äôs gonna get his war‚Äù!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zeonitex,"I liked how Eren forgave Reiner personally, but was still going to fuck up Marley."
zeonitex,ProfessorRigby,I couldn't tell if he was being serious or not
ProfessorRigby,LucHendriks2003,"I think he was, i mean he is doing exactly the same as reiner did"
zeonitex,majurz,"It was a nice little twist. From the preview and up to that point I assumed that Eren meant he's the same as Reiner as in he's not sure what the right path is. I had the same feeling about Eren at the end of Season 3 part 2, when they were at the beach. But when Eren said ""I've probably been like this ever since I was born."" I immediately remembered how angry and full of hate Eren always was in the earlier episodes. Then I knew he wasn't conflicted at all. He knows what he's going to do will be just as bad as what Reiner did all those years ago. But he doesn't care. That is just the person he is/became. Now he's just able to hide his feelings. That's all that changed. That's what I think, anyway.

Maybe it was obvious to others, but it wasn't to me."
majurz,nadin3x_x,You guys help me understanding Eren's fucked up mind thanks y'all
majurz,postcardmap45,"Yeah when we first see him this season, he seems at peace. So he‚Äôs at peace with that hatred that once controlled and consumed him. He‚Äôs internalized it now, it‚Äôs always a *part* of him *and* he can control it. I think it‚Äôs also all influenced by the will/memories of the attack Titan itself.

&#x200B;

But now I‚Äôm really wondering what his main character conflict has been. He hasn‚Äôt shied away from that hatred the way others have (especially once they find out they‚Äôve been killing humans essentially). 

&#x200B;

Also I think at the beach he realizes that there is no way out of this hell for him. Life inside the walls or across the sea wont bring him liberation in the way he had convinced himself as a kid. This would‚Äôve broken anyone‚Äôs resolve...but not Eren‚Äôs lol."
majurz,sptprototype,Very well said
majurz,Samantha_H0918,"ngl Eren's rage in the earlier seasons felt grating to me because it seemed to always lead him into danger and did not pay off in results. But seeing Eren now, even forgetting the hate that he held for those responsible for the misery his people lived in,  instead seeing the world for what it is, shades of grey that leave people with no choice - that was awesome. Eren is much more endearing to me as a character now."
zeonitex,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,I see this as growth. Eren realizes the problem is much bigger than Reiner now.
zeonitex,Rody2k6,We are in the there aren't good guys anymore territory and I love it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,instantclassico,It dawned on me watching this episode that I'm watching a great serialized drama unfold. Wishing these were hour long episodes too!
instantclassico,Kermit_Memelord,They are if you pause the episode to think about stuff every 5 minutes or so
Kermit_Memelord,daroons,Or watch it twice in a row.
instantclassico,chipthehippie,"Rumor has it that S4 part 2 is actually going to be a grand finale of a Movie, rather than a series."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tomas481516,This was wild. I knew right away that that this tall soldier was hiding something!
Tomas481516,Whale_Hunter88,"but still, who was it? I have absolutely no clue. a character we have seen before, just an ally? the girl recognized him so i guess we might have seen him before"
Whale_Hunter88,TamaraGoodwin292,My guess is Armin but I'm not sure
Whale_Hunter88,Deleeson,Just a guess but I feel like it could be Armin and the height could be explained as a side effect of inheriting the Colossal Titan.
Whale_Hunter88,ProfessorRigby,The person has blonde hair and a fake beard. I'm an anime only and it was pretty easy to figure out.
Whale_Hunter88,77Dawson,I thought the soldier was Connie.
Whale_Hunter88,chipthehippie,"My guess is Armin, since Pick thinks he is familiar and she can't stop talking to him.

 Not to mention, (and this could be pure coincidence), but he's like 7 feet tall like Bertholdt was. I'm guessing it's imagery to show he has the Colossal power."
Whale_Hunter88,Grip-Window,Blonde hair + female-esque voice? Definitely Armin.
Whale_Hunter88,pvnau11,I‚Äôm like 99.9% sure it was Armin
Whale_Hunter88,Pretentious_bat,"It‚Äôs definitely armin!!!! Who knows, maybe he grew when he ate the colossal titan lol"
Whale_Hunter88,notmedontlook,"I mean it‚Äôs Armin right? He turned around before dropping Pieck and Porco revealing his face and it straight up looked like Armin. And then Pieck saying she remembered seeing him, she saw him in Paradis once I‚Äôm pretty sure."
Whale_Hunter88,Tomas481516,100% Armin. We see a glimpse of his face when he let them fall in the pit
Whale_Hunter88,MyTVAlt,"Others are questioning it, so maybe I'm wrong, but when I was watching it seemed very obvious to me that it was Armin. I didnt even question it until I saw your question.

To respond to others doubts 1) Armin was still in in his teens... could have had a late growth spurt or height could be related to colossus titan. Thats a non issue imo. 2) Pieck would have seen him whole scouting the scouts before the big battle to retake the walls."
Whale_Hunter88,philosophyofuranus,She saw his as the cart titan in Paradis
Whale_Hunter88,enotherusername,Had to be arminnn
Whale_Hunter88,visualcriiminal,Armin without a doubt
Whale_Hunter88,Jznaveed,"My first though was Levi as Pieck said she recognized him, but I figured he was too tall for that. Although, he had the same physique."
Whale_Hunter88,george1044,Armin almost certainly.
Whale_Hunter88,somalipilates,I'm guessing Jean. Tall and similar hair
Whale_Hunter88,LightbulbHD,"My best bet is that the dude's Jean. 

Jean-boy is tall and all and he was pretty thin. And in the trailer he had a small beard. Though, the voice actor didn't sound like him maybe he just changed it to blend in or something?"
Whale_Hunter88,Waescheklammer,"The bald guy from Mikasa Squad, what was his name again? My guess is on him."
Whale_Hunter88,Disastrous_Hat2363,Definitely armin
Whale_Hunter88,IndependentSherbert8,Seriously think it was Annie. Can't wait to find out!
Whale_Hunter88,GroundbreakingSort32,It‚Äôs definitely armin
Whale_Hunter88,Settra_Rulez,It‚Äôs definitely Armin. Same hair color and similar voice. I‚Äôm guessing the scout boys are all here on a tactical operation.
Whale_Hunter88,Saell,It‚Äôs 100% Armin and no I haven‚Äôt read the manga.
Whale_Hunter88,Richard_Kingwolf,I believe all people with intelligent titans are connected through the coordinate and that‚Äôs why Kruger could see Eren‚Äôs memories. Maybe that‚Äôs why Pieck somewhat recognized Armin or even Berthoult subconsciously
Whale_Hunter88,Cuda27,The guy who dropped them down the well is definitely Armin.
Whale_Hunter88,QuestionBlock24,"It's armin 100%. When I saw the eyes and the little bit of hair I'm like ""HOLY SHIT ITS ARMIN!"""
Whale_Hunter88,SarcasticBitch94,"It‚Äôs gotta be admin!! He had short blonde hair, he must have had a growth spurt üòÇ"
Whale_Hunter88,ss00660,It‚Äôs 100% Armin. No reason the Colossal Titan shouldn‚Äôt be there to help Eren out and also Armin is needed fkr strategic help.
Whale_Hunter88,ItsABitChillyInHere,The girl recognized him before because she currently has the crawling titan right? The crawling titan probably saw armin at shiganshina
Whale_Hunter88,VeritateDuceProgredi,"It‚Äôs Annie with a fake beard 
I‚Äôll put money on it"
Tomas481516,fleshxcoffin,"THIS IS GONNA BE A STRETCH BUT
Annie‚Äôs father said shes still alive and she would come home. I am feeling that this is not armin. Also the seeming knowledge of the area when Pieck asked where they‚Äôre from..."
fleshxcoffin,iwantmoresoup,wait thats really smart...
fleshxcoffin,GGBeavis,Wait what am I missing? Isn‚Äôt Annie an enemy of paradis? Why would she attack the other warriors?
Tomas481516,Mydogsamy,Armin 1000000000%
Mydogsamy,Tomas481516,"Oh yes, that haircut gave it away!"
Tomas481516,Sandshaker,When I saw him I had a feeling it was armin.
Tomas481516,lisbethslander,"Why do I feel that it's Annie? 
Blond, skinny, tall. 
They must've figured out how to break the crystal and talk her to coming to their side.."
Tomas481516,BigManReef,I thought it was Connie
Tomas481516,John_12341631,"It was 100% Armin. He had a growth spurt and grew a little beard within four years is my guess. She was there during the attack of the walls where Erwin charged ahead, so she must‚Äôve seen him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TimoorBTS,"The ending had no right to be this hypeüò≠üò≠ü•∂
Legit cant wait for the next episode ffs gimme that shit now."
TimoorBTS,Rs90,"I yelled ""GOD DAMN IT!"" as soon as it said ""...to be continued"" lol. In a good way but still. It's reaching sadistic levels of cliffhanger now."
TimoorBTS,_th3on3andonly_,"The Amount of Money i would pay to watch the next episode right now is insaneüò∂ but on the other hand i like to wait for it, its the highlight of the week to watch it on sunday"
_th3on3andonly_,whyyougottabesomean,I'm living in Korea and get to watch it after work on a Monday. Makes Mondays a lot better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,L1uQ,"This is, in my opinion, the most epic episode yet, and the fighting hasn't even started.

AOT just keeps on excelling my expectations. The Reiner, Bertholdo reveal felt like the most insane plot twist back then, but it just kept getting better from there on.

Only problem is, how the hell am I supposed to wait a whole week on this cliffhanger?

Edit: spelling"
L1uQ,Chrispix94,"Dude rewatch the first season and you'll see Reiner and Annie and Berdtholt act so strangely. You never see it cause it's in the background or just little sentences, but now it makes soooooo much sense!!!"
Chrispix94,teacupleaff,"I sorta did a rewatch last week because my siblings marathoned the entire thing for the first time. The three of them definitely glance at each other a lot, and they were even in the background as refugees in ep 2 or 3. Reiner said some odd stuff during the plugging the hole with a rock ep, and Bertholdt always had this controlled bewildered expression at Reiner when he's helping around lmao."
Chrispix94,L1uQ,"Yes they did that masterfully. Nothing to obvious, but definitely noticable when you know what's going on."
Chrispix94,dannythesedoritos,"Reiner frantically says ‚Äúhit the deck!‚Äù in S1 Episode 8. It‚Äôs so insignificant on the first watch, but When you realize that that‚Äôs an early 1900s naval term for incoming artillery shells, (no in the wall would know what that means) that would have exposed so much if anyone was paying attention. It really shows how much detail there is that you miss."
Chrispix94,CKA109,Yup rewatching the whole series while I wait for new episodes. Such great little hints hidden throughout.
Chrispix94,Rolikir,I rewatched with my fiance a month or 2 ago and the biggest omfg moment for me was when Eren bashed his head trying to use the broken 3D gear: in the scene after where everyone was eating dinner he had steam coming off his head. Amazing attention to detail.
L1uQ,Moggerino,"Man i've never experienced this, the episode wasn't even that sad but by the end I was almost crying cuz I've been hyped throughout this whole week man best episode for me."
L1uQ,CircumventThis32,Next episode's gon' be lit. Obama is there. God too. Billy Joel strumming in the background while everyone plays checkers. Great work.
CircumventThis32,Eagleassassin3,"Even Tobey Mcguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland will appear as Spider-Men

EDIT: I was permanently banned from the subreddit for some reason so I cannot post new comments. Can anybody explain why? Which mods can I contact about this? I didn‚Äôt even get a warning or anything.

EDIT 2: It didn‚Äôt tell me why I got banned. I did mention the word manga so that must be it. That‚Äôs an insanely stupid reason to ban people wtf? Not to mention doing it permanently! I would love to discuss AoT but I won‚Äôt create a new account just for that. I‚Äôll just be on r/shingekinokyojin and r/titanfolk. Man this is annoying"
L1uQ,SausageGuzzler69,Wait wtf do you mean 2 weeks? Don‚Äôt tell me there‚Äôs another delay?
SausageGuzzler69,ProposalSufficient25,"he used ""two"" instead of ""to"" and it wasn't even before the word ""week"" lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shinjiangoo,LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO SO HYPED
shinjiangoo,Deleeson,EREN MOTHERFUCKING JEAGER
Deleeson,enotherusername,FUCKING FINALLY THO
shinjiangoo,EliteAssassin750,Same! The world will come to a halt when everyone sees it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,triggerhappy66,Jesus christ this was a roller coaster. That moment Reiner fell to Eren's feet saying how he just wanted to die almost brought tears to my eyes. This was insane
triggerhappy66,EtherealFeline,I mentioned this in another comment but I want to see that whole damned scene of Eren and Reiner talking as one uninterrupted cut. That whole scene was by far the highlight of the episode for me.
EtherealFeline,triggerhappy66,"Yes, I was so looking forward to their encounter and it really didn't disappoint. I'm so glad Eren also sees their similarities and realises why Reiner did what he did. So sad that he still has to fight him. Cant wait to see what'll happen next with these characters"
DanishNinja,okayumyea,or maybe he has people believe that so the REAL warhammer titan is protected..
DanishNinja,sleeplessorion,"The previe for next week shows the war hammer transforming so it probably isn‚Äôt him, unless he ends up not getting eaten"
DanishNinja,Tempics,"I feel like him being the head of the family makes him the only candidate to not be the war hammer, at least how I see it. And also the preview made it seem like the war hammer was in the stands"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brodycartwrightt,The scene where Eren transforms after the declaration of war and bursts through the building was just so perfect. It gave me major goosebumps and the soundtrack kicked in so well. It was well worth the wait and now I‚Äôve gotta slowly anticipate the next episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MasterPixel13,"Anyone is talking about Eren's transformation, but can we appreciate Reiner's voice, he sounds so regretful when he crouches in front of Eren, props to the voice actor."
MasterPixel13,Myloh_,It crushes me to see Reiner like this the guy just gets more and more in this kinda situations
Myloh_,Thevoidawaits_u,One of the consequences of participating in a genocide. Guilt. Edit: attempted.
MasterPixel13,EtherealFeline,Reiner is officially my all-around favorite character of this whole damned story. And both his Japanese and English voice-actors excel at showing every twisted side of him.
EtherealFeline,Away_Cartographer_21,I know im supposed to feel bad for Riener and I do a little but honestly he has to pay the piper. I cant forgive him.
MasterPixel13,triggerhappy66,That scene was so emotional I almost couldn't keep it together
triggerhappy66,Nearby-County7333,me too man especially when eren helped reiner up i love them both so much
MasterPixel13,SlyTweak,I was bawling my eyes out for Reiner. It was emotional for sure.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,"God I feel terrible for Reiner. 

Wanting to be a hero so badly. Finding out you were only chosen not for your abilities but because someone else wanted to save someone that they loved. Wanting to push on. And now finding out that your literal world might be destroyed as a direct consequence of you just wanting to not feel like a piece of shit. That's a lot of oofs. 

I love it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrK9_12,"Eren:  Oh my boy Reiner its not your fault I understand your feelings ,Falco you are such a sweet boy too  *Anyways* **DIE MUTHAFUCKERSS**"
MrK9_12,_th3on3andonly_,Sums up the tone of the episode perfectly and i absolutely love it
MrK9_12,L1uQ,"Yeah it's pretty insane how cold Eren got. Basically just manipulated Falco to use him as a tool, then risks killing him by demolishing the house they are in ."
L1uQ,chipthehippie,"I mean, Eren was in the same position at Falcos age when Reiner and Bert tore down the walls. I think the point he's making is that ""hey, you guys *had* to do it to us, now we can see why we *must* do it to you"". Basically, nobody is safe as long as Eren can secure what he sees as ""peace"". Falco was just unfortunately born on the wrong team."
L1uQ,ShaidarHaran2,"Not a great way to potentially win Falco to their side, lol. I had hoped with all the scouting they've done that might be in the cards, win some Eldians over, but if Eren is going to fuck up the crowd in the next episode preview, not so much."
MrK9_12,EtherealFeline,THAT. I'm so confused and TERRIFIED by that response. What the fuck is Eren up to?
EtherealFeline,qvier1,"the same as reiner, to save the world. Or HIS world precisely"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PacoTang,Best episode of the new season so far
PacoTang,ruizard,I feel like we‚Äôre gonna say it‚Äôs the best episode every time a new episode comes out this season
ruizard,PacoTang,It can only get better from now on
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nariz1234,"Fucking hell, as anime only it will be a nightmare to wait for next week... and then next week. Awesome episode, best in the season so far and one of the best in the series, and people say it will keep getting better, jesus."
nariz1234,nikkixackerman,It is literally torture
nariz1234,ReallyColdMonkeys,"Bro don't forget, we had to wait four whole years between season 1 and season 2. Put it in that perspective week to week should be a breeze. Stay strong my fellow patriot üí™üèæ"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,B_024,"*Reiner finally having a little good time last episode*

Eren: I am gonna do what's called a pro-gamer move."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,DID EREN REALLY JUST YEET(EAT?) WILLY??? LMAOOOOO
Clumulus,PK_RocknRoll,"Yes. 

Don‚Äôt forget about those civilians he murdered!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BrownJeezus603,There was eldian housing above Eren when he transformed. He was well aware that he was going to kill innocent Eldians who he saw as brothers in order to carry out his mission. Eren is on a war path now
BrownJeezus603,Nearby-County7333,when i saw him say that i knew he was gonna kill them but in my mind i still had hope he wouldn‚Äôt but alas... here we are
Nearby-County7333,Enadie,"Yeah. It's sad. War is hell. 

I was thinking about this. Look at this from this stand point; if you try in this instance to avoid and minimize civilian casualties, that means you won't have the full capability to deliver the devastating blow to your enemy taking out their high military command, leadership, and nobility all in one sweep."
Nearby-County7333,justaverage00,"when I first heard him point the people out, I thought he said it so that Reiner wouldn't transform and maybe they'd both walk out together. boy was I wrong"
BrownJeezus603,Inside-Medicine-1349,The islanders don't view them as brothers. Remember how the Marley eldians got that self hate thing going. They cheer as they send people to island to kill them.
Inside-Medicine-1349,chipthehippie,"It has less to do with seeing them as/as not brothers, and more to do with ""complete the mission at all costs"", hence the entire convo leading up to his transformation"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainSmeg,FUCKING BLUE BALLED AGAIN WITH THE ENDING.
CaptainSmeg,Kermit_Memelord,I would throw away my pride and read the manga but being blue balled is absolutely worth it when the Anime is this good
Kermit_Memelord,Jubilantyou,The temptation to read the manga is what keeps the anime viewers so strong
Kermit_Memelord,PK_RocknRoll,"When you finish the anime, I would definitely recommend reading the manga. Some scenes have been cut out in the anime (nothing too major) but it definitely is an all around amazing experience."
okayumyea,failbears,"I'm not sure who's on who's side and what their motivations are, but: 

1) The Asian lady left before shit went down.

2) Tybur was probably in on it, what with his atonement and nerves and all.

3) Magath schemed with Tybur in the previous episode."
okayumyea,EtherealFeline,Oh shit that didn't even cross my mind.
okayumyea,Nearby-County7333,"wait WAIT I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING. so we know that jean and eren are in marley. eren mentioned allies. this could mean that he sent a letter to someone within his squad (he probably didn‚Äôt wanna blow the squad‚Äôs identity so he said allies rather than friends) or he sent it to someone who is an actual ally. eren might have explained in those letters that the receiver (who could be a rat) should tell magath that eren and his friends are in marley. maybe eren wanted magath to know. basically i‚Äôm saying that eren is using the rat to gain an upper hand even tho it blows his cover, which is possibly a part of his plan. but please correct me if this sounds stupid i wouldn‚Äôt wanna leave it up if it does"
okayumyea,HalloweenBlues,Or they wanted this to happen to solidify the declaration of war. This season has been giving me WW2 vibes and this could be their pearl harbor
okayumyea,chipthehippie,"Orrr, and it's a long shot, but maybe the Warhammer has a ""connection"" ability like the Founding titan does. Maybe they could sense it coming, and warned the military."
okayumyea,gregorio02,"I‚Äôm starting to suspect Zeke at this point, with his talks few episodes ago on the royal blood, this week‚Äôs episode where he is split from the rest and doesn‚Äôt appear... he is suspicious as a traitor. No idea why or how he would have done it but I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs suspicious"
okayumyea,and1GS,"I THINK one of the inheritors of the special titans is with the 'resistance.' I forgot which one, but his dad was with Eren's dad in that group back in Marley."
okayumyea,Crazed_Archivist,"I don't know how that would work. How can one transmit information from Paradis to the rest of the world. 

They don't have satellites, they would need telegraph cables or really good fucking runners that can leave the wall, pass trough the titans and deliver a message to a ship"
okayumyea,HugeBootyLover,"As a manga reader who‚Äôs just now watching the anime, good foresight bb üòò"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ProfessorRigby,Why was Zeke given a different location than Pieck and Porco by Armin?
ProfessorRigby,-ShaiHulud-,"I guess it's just an element of ""divide and conquer"" strategy. Separate them to decrease their opportunity to coordinate a response. Zeke is a very smart boy, and terrifying when in company of other shifters. But on his own, he's less of a threat."
-ShaiHulud-,jellyfishjumpingmtn,"Holy shit I just remembered something.

Magaths conversation with Willy about crumbling pillars sounded like talk about a rat.

Also them spying on Zeke and saying that a sentence of his concerned him... remember that weird bit? wtf...

Edit:
HOLY SHIT I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING ELSE

Didnt the soldier (Armin?) just tell Zeke ""he was wanted at the gate""?? So he left BY HIMSELF? Theres no way they would trust him to do that, Zeke would quickly find out it was a ruse wouldnt he???"
-ShaiHulud-,jellyfishjumpingmtn,"Textbook strategy, separating the leader from the rest of the group.

Zeke also seemed permissive though.. about letting Reiner and Falco leave before the event started...  and remember that scene where Eren had a baseball and glove and told Falco he got it from his ""family""?

Sounds crazy but ive been wondering. since Zeke has royal blood, maybe Eren could have mindcontrolled him? I have no idea, this is just a theory, I havent read manga either so dont spoil it plz

Edit: I just realized this but it seems like Zeke leaves *by himself* after Armin tells him ""he's needed at the gate""? Ok thats kind of weird, there is no way that he would allow for such a contingency in one of his plans on purpose. Zeke roaming around alone is not something Armin wouldve done compared to trapping him.

Not sure what to make of that but its really suspect. Starting to think a lot more is going on behind the scenes. Also.. the Asian lady leaving early"
ProfessorRigby,Ahmed_Umar,Armin's pretty tall now...
Ahmed_Umar,ProfessorRigby,Maybe it has something to do with him being the colossal?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,americu,"So this Madam Azumabito that came to see Willy before his speech, then left before it even began... I am reading it right that she maybe knew what was about to go down? It was a really brief scene where she left with her two guards, but makes me suspicious that she had some sort of information. 

Also is she the one that Udo spilled wine on at the party in the previous episode?"
americu,Ahmed_Umar,"Yes, she's the same person Udo spilled wine on."
americu,Professional-Leave71,"I dont think isayama is showing her this much without a reason, she will definitely play a major role in the story."
americu,JRD_491,"I was just about to comment something similar. She left just before shit hit the fan and has been given a fair bit of screen time in previous episodes so I think she's definitely going to be significant to the plot in one way or another.

Come to think of it, wouldn't it make sense that Eren and co were working with someone from Marley? It would have made it much easier for then to plan their attack. Her sympathy for the eldians plus the fact that she didn't attend the speech has me thinking that she's working with Eren."
americu,ScrumptiousJazz,I think they are in on erens plan and want to destroy marley
ScrumptiousJazz,Bigfish150,Would make sense why she would go to talk to Willy too if she knew he was about to die
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iFragFamilys,Poor Falco
iFragFamilys,sassyaspho,I see he gets a lot of hate from people but I like him! And I honestly felt so bad for him in this ep!
sassyaspho,ShaidarHaran2,"He does? I've seen people mostly feeling bad for how na√Øve the child soldiers are and hoping they might be spared. 
 
Poor kid actually was excited when he thought he was introducing two old friends"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daniel6392,"The guy that trapped Pieck and Porco, I am pretty sure that is Armin. I don‚Äôt remember if Pieck has had any encounter with him but he has got to be Armin."
Daniel6392,bLzPutozof,Yah i thought i was armin as well but the only thing that made me question that was the height. But hey some people grow up slower than others so if it does turn out to be him i'd believe that.
bLzPutozof,merlemi,I know that I'm probably wrong but maybe the collosal titan in him gave him a little bit of a boost lol
Daniel6392,Mafamaticks,"If that‚Äôs not Armin I‚Äôd jump off a roof. 

I‚Äôd even go as far as to say the scouts are in Marley and have been in Marley for years waiting on this moment to reveal themselves."
Mafamaticks,Nearby-County7333,THATS WHAT IM SAYING if that‚Äôs armin then there‚Äôs 3/8 there. it would make sense to have half in marley and half in paradis so i feel like there‚Äôs at least one more
Mafamaticks,Serbaayuu,"Not only have they been in Marley, they've gotten **allies**.  The Japanese woman knew shit was about to go down, she left on purpose.  Willy wasn't going to kill everyone in his audience.  He was going to end the show and let them go home.  She knew Eren would be there."
Mafamaticks,Gameburn,"Don't make it a high roof, just in case. You gotta make it to see the end.

We in this together."
Mafamaticks,cheese_bruh,"can't be Armin, that person was so incredibly tall and you could see their eyes before they cut the rope which didn't look like Armin's. The soldier was also probably acting like a soldier before they trapped Pieck and Porco and it'd be pretty hard to not stand out as a new person when you're a tall ass person who's never been seen before. I'd say it may have been an Eldian Resistance person who's already familiar with Marley and was already in the army, or they may even be Marleyan themselves and sympathising with Eldians."
Mafamaticks,arm_is_king,">If that‚Äôs not Armin I‚Äôd jump off a roof. 

Hey"
Mafamaticks,Mafamaticks,*checking to make sure the coast is clear *
Mafamaticks,-WonderPug,I think it‚Äôs Jean but happy if Armin
Mafamaticks,DOOMFOOL,"No you‚Äôre too young to die. Seriously though if it IS Armin I‚Äôll jump off the roof for you. There‚Äôs just no way his voice(same VA), eye color, and basic facial features changed that drastically. Also he‚Äôs apparently in the NBA now"
Mafamaticks,undyingcatcus,"I wouldn‚Äôt go that far, this anime loves to subvert even the smallest of expectations"
Mafamaticks,horny_furry_dog,"RemindMe! 1 week

I think it's Armin too but still"
Mafamaticks,HugeBootyLover,Bruh u good?
Mafamaticks,seizethed,Hello did you jump off the roof? I hope not
Daniel6392,Aurora-Stoned,"his voice just really threw me off, its not armins nor jeans."
Daniel6392,Professional-Leave71,No way armin would get that tall lol i thought it could be jean but i don't think that's his voice.it's really confusing!!
Professional-Leave71,Professional-Leave71,The voice kinda of reminds me of conny's. But conny is even shorter than armin üòÇ
Professional-Leave71,TehPwndaz,idk maybe the colossal titan gave him some extra height lol
Professional-Leave71,SploshFlop,"If you look closely when Pieck sees him from behind, he has blonde hair! Plus it has been stated that there was a 4 year(I think) time-skip since thr 3rd season so a lot could have changed!"
Daniel6392,Vishesh007,I think it's Armin because the colossal Titan had an effect on him and he grew tall. Same like bertholt
Daniel6392,RiYaZeD,Might be Connie but he‚Äôs too tall
Daniel6392,-HeisenBird-,It has to be Armin. He's the only one who can defend himself since he has the colossal. I guess having the power of the colossal makes you undergo a growth spurt.
Daniel6392,fleshxcoffin,"Armin wasnt the only blonde on the island, and we have a father certain of his daughters return.
Im anime only so this is pure speculation but......."
fleshxcoffin,YUNoDie,"The soldier had a beard. Not that it couldn't be a fake one but I would still bet on them being a dude. 

Additionally, Annie has a distinctive aquiline nose that the soldier did not have, and I don't think Paradis has any plastic surgeons."
Daniel6392,Blupoisen,I don't think so look at the guy eyes they look nothing like Armin's
Daniel6392,Renousim3,Nose doesn't match
Daniel6392,Twindo,For all we know it could be a random marleyan soldier working for Eren and the gang. They would definitely need some help from the inside in order to infiltrate and get in to Marley. They couldn‚Äôt just Titan shift and break a hole in the Marleyean defense to cause a distraction lmao.
Daniel6392,goddamelectrik,"It most certainly is not Armin. It's someone new who hasn't been introduced to the show yet for sure. There hasn't been any talk about titan powers changing your physical human body in the show. Sure, Armin may have had a growth spurt but that's someone new. There is no way the cart titan recognizes who Armin is."
goddamelectrik,EatPastaRunFasta87,"So I‚Äôve finally gave in and started season 4 without waiting for it to end.. and holy cow are you the only one that is right about this Armin/non Armin situation! 

Like that‚Äôs absolutely not Armin, I think you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs someone new and that looks like a woman too. I don‚Äôt know if they showed who that is in the following episodes cause this is as far as I got today but it‚Äôs annoying me that all these people think that now Armin is double the size he was!"
Daniel6392,sassyaspho,"I‚Äôm an anime only but my guess is that it‚Äôs not Connie, Armin, or Jean. My guess is that it‚Äôs someone new that we haven‚Äôt met yet. Also if you listen to the voice they almost sound like a girl who is trying to sound like a guy. At first I was thinking Hange, Sasha, or Mikasa in disguise but  once I saw the blonde hair I knew it wasn‚Äôt the girls we already know. This person is too tall to be Connie or Armin, but too soft spoken with soft facial features and almost too slender to be Jean. Yes, I know Pieck mentioned a beard buuut what if it‚Äôs just part of the disguise?? If it is someone new that could also explain why this person seemed familiar to Pieck, she might have seen them around Marley before. 

So anyways, my guess is a new girl we haven‚Äôt met yet!"
Daniel6392,khabo,"It could be levi, when Pieck saved the Zeke she saw him. But I have no clue cause this anime is so unpredictably amazing"
khabo,daroons,Levi on stilts then
Daniel6392,dksa,I was guessing it‚Äôs some inherited memory for whatever reason
Daniel6392,chipthehippie,"She watched from the wall as he was revived and ate Bert so, he has to be familiar lol."
Daniel6392,CubonesDeadMom,Yeah I agree
Daniel6392,WebDad1,"Pieck vaguely remembers him because Pieck has the Cart Titan, who saw Armin in S3."
Daniel6392,McBurger,"It absolutely is, it has to be.  She kept saying he looks familiar.  He‚Äôs blonde and all.  Just about every character got taller.  It just has to be"
Daniel6392,JESquirrel,I am 100% saying it is Jean and I am also saying that there will be a flashback of Jean pushing Hange and that is what makes her remember who it is.
Daniel6392,Narwhals4Lyf,I feel like it is Armin but Pieck talking about recognizing them is kinda weird to me
Daniel6392,Snsjsjsjjjjjjj,She would hav seen him at the end of season 3 when she saved reiner
Daniel6392,uranthus,I might be crazy but I think it's Annie. I'm late to this episode so maybe it's revealed in the next episode.
ReggieEvansTheKing,Sogekingu88," If you look when he cuts the rope, you can see the eyes and they are brown. Armin are blue. Cant be him. With eyes, hair and build, I don't think its a character that was introduced before this season. Also the eyes and face with what looks like a fake beard makes me believe its a woman."
Bruvguy72,DanishNinja,But Annie is stuck in a crystal though.
Bruvguy72,ounage,Hmm I thought so too but the nose shape was distinctly different
LordOfNightsong,DanishNinja,Zeke was in the same scene as the soldier so nah.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SenpaiBoomEd,"I cannot believe how wonderful this episode was. It was so good and the main part hasn't even started yet. I can only imagine how great of a roller coaster ride this is gonna be with simultaneous mix reactions. Sorry if my English was bad, english isn't my first language."
SenpaiBoomEd,CapSRogers,"Your English is really good, bro"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,danielwilu2525,This isn‚Äôt the same Eren we once knew
danielwilu2525,CrocodileSunday,"The old Eren was in the dark, he‚Äôs had 4 years to know the true situation now!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FHI_iSmile,Got goosebumps when Eren transformed and instantly killed Willy. Amazing episode 10/10
FHI_iSmile,EtherealFeline,"I am \*not\* manga-reader so I'm not sneaking in spoilers, but I have a sinking feeling that Willy is somehow gonna make it out of Eren's clutches alive."
EtherealFeline,chachamonkey,I don‚Äôt know if the after credit teasers are considered spoilers so I won‚Äôt say anything but go watch it.
FHI_iSmile,Nearby-County7333,ok i was gonna say is willy dead like fr i couldn‚Äôt tell
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,walkyrie1997,"This Episode is Hella Nice. 
Reiner, Falco and Willy's Acting is so much appealing. 
Eren with cold stares pretty dope, The ""Eren Yeager"" vibes still there. 
Another new mystery about the Soldier guy who leads to Pieck and Galliard. 
The hype will be continues, 
As well as the MAPPA doing great for this episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seraiss,"Eren when he touched Rainer with his blood to transform : 
I put a little sneaky on you"
seraiss,verticaluzi,Why did he need to touch Reiner to transform ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cromatose,MAKE EPISODES 1 HOUR YOU COWARDS
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingKRhule,WORTH THE WAIT! I swear every episode gets better and better this season. My only theory from this episode is that the Azumabito famly is on Paradis' side. I'm just guessing based on the way she treated Udo at the party and that Jean in one of the first after credits scene is wearing similar clothing to her bodyguards
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daroons,"So from a narrative perspective, the main cast have now become the villains of the story... killing innocents to further their agenda. But I guess it's also been said that nobody is the villain in this story. Still, this is really some crazy stuff that Isayama is pulling on us here, spending the last 4 episodes humanizing the ""enemy"" to us. I honestly don't know who I'm supposed to root for anymore.

Edit: wanted to clarify that by ‚Äúvillains‚Äù what I really meant to say was that Season 4 has so far presented the Eldians as the protagonists and the Paradisians as the antagonists. Not that the island folk are the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù. There are no ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù in this show as it seems... just as there are no ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù."
daroons,kitsune-oni,"I think that's the point. Like I'm sure the main theme that Isayama wanted to point out when making this series. War and mass slaughter doesn't fix anything. Both sides are evil in their own way. The only peace the human/titan race will get is either when we accept our differences and live peacefully alongside each other, OR when war has caused the extinction of all humanity. 

At least thats what I take away from it."
kitsune-oni,daroons,It hits a little too close to home when you consider how unnecessary conflict is in our world when you really think about it. But also knowing that the same time. simply for the reason of ‚Äúhumans are flawed‚Äù that we know that conflict is inevitable.
daroons,M13LO,"I disagree. Not only did Marly started the war first, they started by attacking civilians. Just because they were pushed back doesn‚Äôt mean the war is over. And just how in WWII the Germans began bombing civilians, the Allies retaliated by also bombing civilians but the Allies were still the good guys. It‚Äôs the same concept here."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OOM-32,"Fuck dude, this is really sad. I honestly expected Tybur to not declare actual war, but rather offer peace. But no, he threw all his peace discourse over the window on the last line."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AsrielGoddard,Fuck that was great. I immediatly watched the episode a second time after finishing it.
AsrielGoddard,Rs90,Same. I didn't catch that Zeke was sent elsewhere than his comrades. Makes me wonder if Levi is fuckin waiting for him. I'm just imagining Levi simmering for 4yrs over getting his revenge. Fuuuuck. Eren's eyes were spooky but Levi will be a straight up demon.
Rs90,ShaidarHaran2,"The last time they faced off, Levi didn't have breakfast. Levi with breakfast? Potentially unstoppable."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,evermuzik,"Stop, I can only nut so much."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Minshow,"""I declare war""

.0000000001 seconds later

""No, not, like, now, fuck fuck fuck!"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nejustinas,"The end scene was just poetry happening, Willy declaring war and getting praise and admiration for it, but Eren shows him what war really is about and that you **do not** actually want war. It was just a dreamy fantasy to harsh reality scene in a few seconds.

Reiner's and Eren's conversation is quite philosophical and I believe asked a lot in any real War literature, the question being *Is my enemy at fault for what he is doing and wouldn't we had just been good friends if there was no war.*"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,callmehalleluja,at first i thought that eren would invite reine to his ranks because reiner now knows that what he did was wrong
callmehalleluja,EtherealFeline,"I was hoping for that too, but then to watch Eren transform and screw over Reiner and Falco like that is 100% ""Attack on Titan"". Isayama baited us hard, and we paid the price."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LucHendriks2003,I just hope Falco is ok
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RadonBob,"What's up with Pieck hugging those soldiers out of nowhere? Considering the previous seasons, Isayama certainly listened to Chekhov."
RadonBob,Furthest_Lands,They ride in the machine gun nest on her back.
Furthest_Lands,Phantombk201,Wish i could ride Pieck also.
Furthest_Lands,RadonBob,"It's not the hug per se, it is why the hug is included in the episode. It don't see the relevance."
RadonBob,RejwanMiahXO,Because they ride the cart titan
RadonBob,promptotron5000,"I'm not a manga reader but it's frustrating that nobody else is talking about this or just disregarding it. You are right, there is a reason they showed that scene right after she starts questioning the guard. 

The simplest one is that she warned them. The stunned look on their face as well as the other guy being surprised by her move - it's clear that this is out of character for her. People are overlooking it the same way they overlooked Reiner ""escaping"" from Female Titan's clutches in S1."
RadonBob,starwaver,My theory is that Pieck probably told the guy something before leaving. I think Pieck is the equivalent of Armin on the Marley side and probably expected something to happen
RadonBob,Nearby-County7333,see what i dont get is what porco said after that. he said something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre putting a dent in that relationship‚Äù or something. what the hell does that mean ??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,soupmachine_,Reiner shat himself at least 3 times while talking to Eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kawaii-nani,My heart is broken for Eren and friends. To have to become the thing they hate and to have no fault for the life they were born to is so sad. But they really couldn't continue living that way.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EliteAssassin750,Finally hearing Eren's Titan roar again made me scream and cream
EliteAssassin750,DasOddie,scream de la creme
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hahaharich,Yooo this new episode was sick
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rando-gender,The internet is going to freak out when this episode and the coming episodes come out
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,"Fr imagine hiring an iconic VA like Kakashi Sensei to make us think Willy was going to play a main role just to be eaten within the same breath that he declares war. That's some meta gaming lmaooo. 

(Honestly the fact that we didn't see him getting chomped probably means he survives next ep, still.)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,axelMORTICIANO,That was one of the most tense 25 minutes of my life
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,Man it was so cool to learn about all the additional King Fritz/Tybur/Marley lore.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mila_2690,"There are some spoilers down there in the comments, be careful guys."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HeiToki,"Why does everyone have that tired and dreadful look in their eyes? You can tell the war is putting a LOT of stress on everyone.

&#x200B;

Especially the Cart titan she's always looking sleepy.

edit: No show has made me be on the edge of my seat like this since Game Of thrones. This is so good!"
HeiToki,shaynedoan129,The cart titan looks like that because she was in titan form the majority of their time on the island. Permanent scars from that I'm assuming
HeiToki,chipthehippie,"Shifters are literally dying at an accelerated rate. Eren Kruger looked the same before he passed on the Fight Titan. Reiner as well, is currently looking this way. I don't believe it's necessarily war stress, and is more to do with them being at the end of their lifespan. Notice the current holder of the Jaw Titan doesn't have that look, since he only recently inherited the Jaw power within the past few years."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sir_Morgoth,Anyone notice the black dude in the crowd sounded like Bertholdts VA? They must have got him to do a couple of extra lines whilst he was there to make the trip worth it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,onlyforshadyshit,TFW when you realize there's 11 episodes left.
onlyforshadyshit,EtherealFeline,"how do you know only 11???

*Edit: Just saw the total episode listing on MyAnimeList... No way..."
onlyforshadyshit,Heyohmydoohd,I doubt there's only 11. Prolly gon be a S4 P2 because there was an interview saying every chapter will be adapted to the end. No way they get like 40 chapters in like 16 episodes. Not a manga reader tho.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-ShaiHulud-,"Just rewatching this episode a second time, and something caught me off guard. At the beginning, there's a weird interaction between Lady Kiomi and Willy. She says how courageous he is and that her whole ""clan"" knows this. And then there's another scene where she leaves and says to her bodyguards ""alright, let's leave"" with a shit-eating grin on her face. What was that all about? Could her ""clan"" be the actual Tybur clan with Willy being just a figure head? And Willy's ""courageousness"" being a reference to him pretty much sacrificing himself on stage (it seems like Magath and Willy anticipated the attack from Eren & Co). It looks like we're about to witness a ruse within a ruse within a ruse."
-ShaiHulud-,AvocadoBeats,Shit you might be onto something
-ShaiHulud-,Dionysus_Unbound,"Lol plans within plans. Nice Dune references, username checks out"
-ShaiHulud-,LezTalkz,"No, I think this was actually a touch of historical reference. The nazis were working with the Japanese, and I think they wanted to keep the theme.

In reality, they knew something was going to happen that night. Will was sacrificing himself on stage to get Eren and stuff to show their cards....they already had a feeling. The Japanese woman said he was courageous bc she knew he was going to die that night"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,venusaires,I think Willy‚Äôs production got too overboard. He even hired Eren himself ü§Ø
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cbfw86,"Not a manga reader, just here for the anime.

Are they going to finish this? I've read things online which concern me. Are they going to screw the anime and fudge it so they can fit so many manga chapters into such a small number of episodes?"
cbfw86,Ahmed_Umar,"They are only animating till ch 122, then either there'll be a second part or a movie(highly likely simply because of the scale and cost needed for the finale)."
Ahmed_Umar,cbfw86,Ok. So they won't stop at the end of S04E16?
Ahmed_Umar,Reggie_156789,damn i dunno what i would prefer season 4 part 2 or a movie...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,darthv3ith,That guy that trapped pieck is 100 percent armin

Armin with a beard.
Facial Hair Armin.

I can't get over the fact that Armin has facial hair."
kitsune-oni,Nearby-County7333,the beard is so fake too like LMAO
kitsune-oni,RealTheGreenGuy,Armin looking Charmin
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iJacobes,"MAPPA IS ABSOLUTELY KILLING IT THIS FINAL SEASON!!! I checked my heart rate with my Apple Watch a couple of times during the scenes with eren and Reiner, and my HR got almost up to 90 üòÇ god damn what a ride this show is."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zenkikid,"None of this would‚Äôve happened if the Marleyan government left Paradis island alone to live in peace within the walls.


Fuck them up Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Crypter,Every fucking time. I cry everytime the ending song comes in. Either from excitement or sadness or sheer hype. I am gonna miss this show soo much once it ends.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,awesomecooper,"I have been saying this for a while and I'm still saying. Eren's character development is the best ever. Nothing comes close. 

According to me that lady from Orien clan who met Willy and saved udo's ass last episode left the event before the speech. She's definitely collaborating with Eren and the gang.

Very confused with what Eren did in the end. Even though it looked fucking bad ass. I felt Eren is going to follow his father to become a revolutionary for Eledian everywhere but straight up killing them makes me feel he doesn't care about anyone but people living in the walls.

Why did the event take place in interm zone, also I'm pretty sure Magath and Willy knew about Eren being here. References the rat in last episode and Magath not surprised when his people when missing. It is ok for a Titan fight as long as it takes place in Interm zone.

That must be Armin.. there is no other option according to me. Looks taller than Eren tbh was that because of Collosal üòÇüòÇ well even previous Collosal was tall üòÇ.

Now Eren has changed so much, if he like Reiner it won't be revenge anymore.

Anything I missed ü§îü§î.

Best episode this season. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüíô"
awesomecooper,Nearby-County7333,"eren said it himself, he‚Äôs the same as reiner. rwiner intitally doesn‚Äôt care about anyone outside of his home, Marley, but after living with the enemy he realizes they‚Äôre not truly evil. same with eren. it‚Äôs not so much as eren not caring about anyone outside the walls, but rather him having a mission to complete. but the safety of his friends is one of his main motivations i would like to think"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hannyy101,"All imma say is Team Eren always, no matter what."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chloe_003,This whole episode was nut worthy. The buildup to Erens Titan transformation had me so insanely hyped up. The music build up is also phenomenal. This whole episode was *chefs kiss*

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ab10ff,"I'm really hoping, based on the preview for next episode, that the War Hammer Titan doesn't just fuck Eren up instantly. He seems to have a habit of getting completely dummied the first time he faces each titan."
Ab10ff,JohnHallYT,I doubt it. That happened before because Eren had only been a shifter for a few months and had no experience. This time he‚Äôs had 4 years to practice and get strong
Ab10ff,Nearby-County7333,glad i wasn‚Äôt the only one who thought that. as soon as i saw the preview i was like goddamnit cuz i REALLY don‚Äôt wanna see eren get his ass whooped for the billionth time it‚Äôs so embarrassing üò≠
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,D7oomeGames,"How did you guys watch it when it dosent come out for 2 hours on all websites, including pirated"
D7oomeGames,Sakularad26,In Germany the episode released an hour ago
Sakularad26,DJ-Adios,superior german technology i see
D7oomeGames,Professional-Leave71,"Arab translators are fast, they sub it about 2 hours and a half after it's aired in japan."
D7oomeGames,PacoTang,There‚Äôs a subbed out already
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hemisby,"So guys just make sure I am getting this right because it is kind of confusing when Willy is commending King Fritz and the Eldians, since King Fritz basically stopped The Great Titan War and then he wants to go to war with them. The only reason Willy wants to go to war with them is because 1) What the Eldians did and how they killed so many people with the titans and 2) Eren Yaegar has the Founding Titan instead of a royal descendant and they don't know what he will do with it? Making sure I am right"
Hemisby,realkin1112,"well willy is an Eldian himself, and the reason he declared war is that the founding titan is with Eren, who doesn't share king fritz ideals of renouncing war. (Eren has no royal blood therefore the renouncing war does not apply to him)"
Hemisby,treskro,I think it‚Äôs more the latter- he wants to take the initiative to go to war now that the Founding Titan is in the hands of an unknown actor.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ML_CS_Throwaway,"Eren looked worried when Willys speech sounded like peace, and smiled after the declaration of war. The details are once again incredible."
ML_CS_Throwaway,drishya136,"actually no. In the manga, he is kinda hopeful when that peace comes but it is turned out when the war is declared. His eye widening is kinda hopeful."
drishya136,TestaRossa95,"Yes! I haven't read the chapter for this (anime-only, with occasional chapters from anime-covered story), but that's the vibe I got from the episode. Eren was surprised, but was keeping an open mind. Followed by resigned, sad smile.

[comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/attackontitan/comments/kuhrxr/attack_on_titan_season_4_episode_5_declaration_of/giuyi7q/) I'd just posted before reading yours"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hercratoras,"I am calling it, something is up with Eren's blue-glowing eyes. They used to be green glowing when he transformed and now they started glowing even before transforming. Something to do with the coordinate power maybe"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,morganscaptain221,Anyone noticed that Eren has the same nervous tick as is half brother now? The scratching behind the left ear I think it is a nice little detail. Both of them do it when they feel above it all.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedditIsPropaganda84,"As an Anime-only watcher, I'm really excited to see what the Warhammer Titan's power is. I think it'll be able to use the Titan-hardening ability to form hammers or swords with it's limbs. Whatever it is, I think it will catch Eren off guard and give him a tough fight even though Eren has had 4 years to train with his Titan ability."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Legnaron17,"How in the world did they manage to keep the tension up through the ENTIRE episode?? honesly, it was jaw-dropping, the music choice (including ost from S1 which literally made me pause the ep cause i could not handle the hype of that throwback), the animation, it was all perfect and SO well achieved, cannot wait for the next one"
Legnaron17,jojo_not10,"Dude yesss!!! 
When they used season 1 ost, I jumped! I loved it!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KGun-12,"I appreciate what they are trying to do here with the moral relativism, but I just don't care. Four episodes from this POV does not make up for three seasons of these shitbags tormenting and murdering everyone I came to care about in this show.

Go Eren. Wipe them all out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cbfw86,"So good. I just hope we see some dope ass shit like Levi and Mikasa coming out of nowhere with ODM gear joining the fight. Maybe even cutting the War Hammer titan down.

I'm excited. So good. Gonna watch it again."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Beats_by_Griff,Man I hate that I‚Äôve watched this anime alone so now I have to come here to confirm the HOLY SHIT that I experience
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,The way the random soldier sent Zeke off instead of trapping him with Pieck and Porky makes me think Zeke‚Äôs allegiance is more complicated than we fought. I mean Eren does have a baseball and had to have gotten it form someone. Furthermore Zeke and Eren are brothers and this show does have a very strong theme of how powerful family bonds are.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Warliss,"Great Episode! My takes...

1) Marley government knew something- they had a very strong and alert military standing by for a play/announcement on their own soil...

2) Pieck/Cart might have told the panzers unit ""follow us"" or ""check on us"".
The panzer guy was ""shocked"" a little more than just getting a hug from a sexy heroine...(in the next week's trailer we see Cart and Jaw standing on the street as opposed to  the grass floor of dungeon)- Panzer tossed down a rope i'm thinking.

3) In the beginning, Annie and Bert were discussing the old man wanting to be judged, then they cut to Reiner who wanted Eren to judge him...just an observation..

4) Asian lady IMO, Ackerman, She had an A on her back and says ""clan"" to Willy, previous cut info bump stated Levi, Mikasa, and Kenny are all Ackerman with ""related ?"" and states: they can call on inner power/rage and can't be brainwashed.

5) I'm going with Arimin for the guard, Zeke was too relaxed through the whole ordeal and told deliberately by guard to go somewhere else, with no question or suspicion by Zeke. Is he that laid back? He definitely in the know IMO..

6) Willy trying to get countries to help do what Marley couldn't.
Remember, they tried to kidnap the founding Titan when it was still in Royal peace-keeping possession, so yeah he left that out.

Funny to me: Eren: ""it's cool Reiner, you were a brainwashed child following orders"". Reiner: ""Yeah, but i kind went out my way to get thousands of innocent people killed and your mom too""..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shinpachix,I keep coming to this thread to get my fix of aot. I have never been this desperate for an episode before.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Awe35,"I haven't seen this commented on yet so I'm pointing it out: Eren's Titan's mouth is different than before. S1-S3 He had flat teeth and kind of two levels of teeth? And the current titan has one level and all sharp teeth.

I really doubt its an actual plot point, but might be a reflection of character and that Eren is much more savage or unhinged than before"
The_Awe35,Pratham2003,"Or could just be change in studio so change in animation style,bertholdt looked weird asf too"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mastermaze,That was one of the most stressful episodes of show Ive ever watched holy fuck

KILLS EVERYONE"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,postcardmap45,"One detail that foreshadowed that the whole Helos story was a lie, was that the statue shows the hero stabbing the Titan through the cheeks not the nape. They show it briefly but it‚Äôs glaring.  


Also, (NO SPOILERS PLS) Still kinda confused why the Tyburs chose to betray the Eldians in the past. Why didn‚Äôt the Tyburs escape too? Why didn‚Äôt all Eldians leave for Paradis. This Tybur guy admits that his Titan sold out all Eldians...but he still benefits from the power of being allied with the Marleyans ;-/"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mega__lul,"Goddamn !! Whoever decides these endings is the biggest cuck in history. ‚Äú Ooh the last episode was a huge ass cliffhanger, end the next one on an even bigger one ‚Äú . I really didn‚Äôt see Eren killing all of those people . I highly doubt they introduced Will just for him to die like that."
Mega__lul,jellyfishjumpingmtn,"Literally just by transforming he killed a ton of innocent ppl lol.

Not sure if that was Will. Did Eren just steal the Warhammer power? I doubt it will be that easy but thatd be wild"
jellyfishjumpingmtn,flatmeditation,"It was definitely Willy. Willy Tybur doesn't have the Warhammer titan though, at least he claimed that last episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TakingSouls,"This is episode was amazing, the music, the delivery of Wily‚Äôs speech, Reiner‚Äôs whimpering all amazing. I think my one problem was the facial expressions of Eren werent focused on as much as I would have liked but thats it lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jdep11,GOD DAMN this episode was sick
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,centyauro,"I just imagine falcos experience there the whole time is like ""omg it's the bad guy"" then towards the end being like ""omg it's the.... Bad guy?"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deadBoybic,Am I the only one who didn‚Äôt make the connection that Mr. Krueger was actually Eran? Damn near shit my pants during the cold open!
deadBoybic,AnselLovesNuts,Lowkey wish I was you. The surprise must‚Äôve been wild lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dismatic,"Not entirely sure but I think Madam Azumabito is totally aware of what's going on, and may be supporting Eren."
Dismatic,Twindo,I like to think that Mikasa is residing with her and the Oriental Clan while the rest of the gang are scattered among the Marleyan population.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,turbokat123,"Oh man, the whole aura of Eren being so calm and in control. He feels so much more resolved and mature. 

The way they show how aware he is of the surroundings, his positioning, talking in a way which shows he knows what's gonna happen exactly, I just feel very soon all our beloved survey corps soldiers will be shown executing this explosive and strategically constructed plan planned by them over all these years. That's just me presuming due to this unmanageable excitement and pent up desires!

PS: Eren's Titan looking even monstrous now, gaawd!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PanChiN0,So I stopped watching AOT in the mid of season 2 but last week decided to re-watch..... and I‚Äôm ADDICTED. I JUST finished season 3 and I had a quick question for y‚Äôall. Will season 4 be 24 episodes or only 12?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lord_Xp,[Strawpoll](http://www.strawpoll.me/42421641) for figuring out who everyone's favorite new character/s are for this season. Feel free to vote on multiple people. I'll share results next week.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ppverysmall124,"Omg the ending tho was just like the last one, leaving us soooo hyped and impatient for the next ep, I also am suuuuper hyped and impatient for ep 6"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SaminRockz,Who could be the war hammer?
SaminRockz,barcaAW,"I personally dont think its Willy, would be too obvious."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,invest_in_potatoes,So did falco and/or Reiner survive that when Eren transformed?
invest_in_potatoes,Imatination,I would assume so. The poster art shows Reiner looking at a transformed Eren. It would be crazy to think that Eren wiped out three important characters in one blow!
Imatination,Reader575,I wonder how though. Part transformation like eren in S1?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,typicalasiannerd,"I can't wait to see Armin use his new Titan powers, I was kind of hoping we would see it in this one but Reiner-Eren scenes are amazing too. Fuck the Tyburs"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vehneez,i've always felt this way since season 1 but wow the art style of everyones eyes is so beautiful and intense. eren's eyes this ep especially while he was transforming has got to be one of my favorite scenes ever
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,M3rc_Nate,"I was really excited about the slim possibility that our ""good guys"" were going to end the cycle of violence with what Eren was saying but it looks like it's full out war."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,I can‚Äôt help but feel as if Magath has his own agenda and reasons for Marley‚Äôs alignment with the other nations and the declaration of war against Paradis. I almost feel as if he let Tybur die knowing full well what was about to go down but I don‚Äôt know why he would do that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NoCuCumbersallowed,imagine people who don't know aot and see declaration of war  is trending
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loweyegaze,"Getting serious Zuko vibes from Reiner right now - scorned by others, always had to prove himself, and desired so badly to be respected. It would be a super interesting turn to see Reiner join the other side."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mrbilliebell,Why couldn't game of thrones wrap up the last season as well as this
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LongjumpingTalk8017,"This whole situation seems clear cut to me. Moral culpability cannot be transferred through blood. Every eldian that participated in genocide thousands of years ago is dead. All we have is the present situation, paradise eldians who up till now has lived terrorized by the entire world and by the terrifying apathy of their own king to their death and suffering. The eldians of the Marley are oppressed, controlled, and forced to become Titan shifters or Titans themselves. Nobody really remembers this time as everyone is dead. It‚Äôs like trying to hold Italians accountable for the massacres performed by the Roman Empire. The Marleys declared war and oppressed Eldians for centuries with the consent of the world, and declared war on Paradise islands, whatever Eren does seems to be tit for tat to me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justmiike,"Astonishing level of storytelling. As an author, I am in absolute awe!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AlecHasEyes,"Attack On Titan is like a time machine... 
20 mins pass in 3"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Joker7189,Are we worried that there won't be enough episodes to get through everything? I'm so hype and enjoying this that I don't want it to go away.
Joker7189,LlamaLegacy,"The current pace is only 2 chapters/ep, so we‚Äôre definitely not finishing everything in this season, expect a Season 4 Part 2"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShikaTheApache,I still have goosebumps till now from the ending scene! That's by far the most epic Eren's transformation I've ever seen in the Anime!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Phantombk201,"What an episode! I feel bad for everybody involved which is for unusual that a show makes you feel this way. I feel especially bad for the kids. Poor kind-hearted Falco got deceived and tricked into becoming a spy that will cause the death of his own people and family, and as far as we know he died in the transformation. Zofia (Sophia?) Was really excited and cute when the loud music started playing. I could only imagine how terrified she is when Eren showed up. Udo wanting nothing but the image of the Eldians to improve with the rest of the world to stop the hatred against them, and seeing all that destroyed in a flash. Gabi that was having so much fun during the festival, feeling a ""change"" is coming, learning the shocking truth of king Fritz, and then snapped back to reality with the attack of the devils."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,valarrazor,"I know this is all exciting but there is an inherent depressing side to all of this, that innocents will die and people who are good people will also die and there is no stopping that until a side wins."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yutas_left_toe,i literally just wanted to give reiner a hug the whole episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,istheremoredonuts,"Late to the party, but Madam Azumabito tells Tybur ""My whole clan knows how brave you are."" and then dips afterwards, so I'm thinking that she's either the spy feeding the Tyburs info but also could be working with Eren? Whatever it is I'm hype as fuck"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,that80skid,"I‚Äôve been rewatching this episode and especially that ending scene. Two take always.

1) Eren is still emotional or at least driven by the emotions of his younger self. We makes Reiner admit that he killed his mom and attacked them. And the way Eren throws it all right back into his face. Even the last words Eren uses are personal between him and Reiner. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keeping moving forward. Until I destroy all my enemies.‚Äù Make no mistake Eren internally is still emotional, he‚Äôs just not expressing those emotions the same way.

2) It‚Äôs terrifying how deadpanned / unemotional Eren is about the whole exchange with Reiner is. He comes off as cold and detached yet he‚Äôs discussing personal things with Reiner. Also was he clenching his fist so hard out of anger that made him bleed? He says he vaguely forgot about it threatening to kill Reiner and his people. I don‚Äôt believe he did forget about it. I think he understands how complicated it all is. He seems to have made up his mind and come to terms with his situation. Where as Reiner doesn‚Äôt (yet?) have that resolve. Reiner still has some compassion and sympathy. I can‚Äôt say the same (yet?) for Eren.

MAPPA continues to kill it with the production of these episodes. My favorite episodes so far.

EDITED: Some words."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Two_Watermelons,I'm having a hype attack
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BenCannibal,"I've actually picked up AoT after about 5 years, I finished Season 1 back then and didn't watch it again because of delays etc but now I've watched every episode start to finish in 2 weeks.

I think one of the biggest tells of Eren's speech is how in S1 or 2 Mikasa talks about how she used to ignore the cruelty of the world, where she's with her mum in the garden and an insect is devouring another one, and where Eren saves her from the kidnappers and convinces her she has to fight or die. You think it's just a heartwarming story of survival up until this episode.

Then you realise it's not just a defensive thing, that whole mindset prepared them for this point where they needed to do the evil deed for survival. If they just said to Reiner ""I forgive you this war will end"" but with the speech everyone in the world would have taken the side of the speaker and agreed to invade Paradis so it's inevitable. 

I love it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Axiser,"Anime only here:

I rewatched the episode and i noticed that the tall soldier had eyelashes, i think its a female and not armin."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justapotato9,"my gosh this season has been so amazing. Totally love eren's development, he is so much calmer and controlled, it feels like Eren would have gone with a more peaceful way if tybur actually wishes for peace too just like Fritz, but no he had to declare on war 

that one scene of Eren closing eyes and smiled slightly after Tybur declared for war is just gold, it's like 'so that's how it's going to be'"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JohnHallYT,Anime only here: we need to have a serious talk about why the tall soldier (Who I‚Äôm 99% sure is admin) let Zeke go somewhere else before he trapped Pieck and Galliard. Why wouldn‚Äôt he just trap Zeke too? Incredibly weird
JohnHallYT,GWillHunting,"Yeah I thought the same thing. They must have special plans for Zeke. Maybe Levi/Mikasa at the wall where he‚Äôs headed? 

The other thought I had is maybe Zeke could recognize Armin, so Armin tried to get away from him ASAP. Zeke always had the binoculars and I feel like he probably has the best chance of recognizing them (besides Reiner of course)"
GWillHunting,Nearby-County7333,y‚Äôall are making me so excited i cannot it‚Äôd be so cool if zeke and levi would meet again and zekes just sitting there traumatized like reiner Lmao
JohnHallYT,hrdp453,Probably because Eren needs to touch him in order to fully utilize the founding titan's powers and needs him kept separate from the others.
JohnHallYT,The_Minshow,"Zeke can make titans, as far as Paradisians know, if he traps them together, zeke can make a random titan, and have it rescue the three of them. Also somebody sent Eren a baseball glove, and Zeke loves baseball, so maybe there is an Eldian restorationist who plays with Zeke, that will try to off him(or a scout that infiltrated Zekes baseball team)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,evolvingsalsa,IM SO PISSED ITS ANOTHER CLIFF HANGER I WANNA SEE SOME ACTION WTFFFF
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Subaroooh,I can‚Äôt wait to see the action animated
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Xrocket321,I love the parallels between Eren‚Äôs infiltration and Rieners+ company‚Äôs infiltration both start to see their enemies as people and both regret their actions but still go toward
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LucHendriks2003,i am in shellshock after this episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fruity_jean,Wow just wow
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sheamurp,"Holyyyyyyyyy CRAP! What a crazy Episode, Eren is a complete badass Can‚Äôt wait until the next ep they followed up one of the biggest cliff hangers with another one so hyped!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DoctorDK,I think the guy who lead the jaw and cart titans to fall down the hole was Armin....
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iAdoreSoda,"This episode had me shaking and vibrating saying ""Holy shit"" the whole time. Absolutely incredible story telling."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SolvingcrimesfromFin,Now I feel bad that I read those manga chapters because I could not wait for this episode....
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingBowser64,"So far I haven‚Äôt seen anyone mention the conversation with Annie‚Äôs father. He seems determined that Annie is alive still. Annie was literally around up until the end of season 1. We now only get her through flashbacks. 
That scene just sat...odd with me. I am curious if it is bait for the audience to believe that Annie will be coming back, but in reality, she‚Äôs dead. I doubt she‚Äôd be willing to be helpful (her personality) if she came out of the crystal, so I feel like maybe Eren ate her in the crystal... I don‚Äôt know, but that scene just felt strange and like bait.

Also, in the teaser for next week: Udo is ‚Äúhelping‚Äù someone on his right that was smashed by a rock. The two people on his right (from where they were sitting for the performance): Gabi (middle) and Zophia (furthest to the right)
Either Gabi and/or Zophia got destroyed by a boulder. I originally thought that it was Zophia that was smashed. It would make sense because Zophia is less important than Gabi and she is sort of a background character, but that‚Äôs why I think that Gabi was killed instead. Gabi is hyped up to be the best, which is why she is thought to be the next Armored Titan. The Armored Titan is supposed to be either Gabi or Falco. Falco wants to save his love interest Gabi, so he wants to become the Armored Titan. What if Gabi is killed by the ‚Äúevil island devil‚Äù Eren? That would cause a fire of hatred to explode within Falco (whom was shown to be questioning the motives in that one train scene with Reiner) towards the people of Paradise. Falco would get the Armored Titan and would be full of hate and anger. I feel like it would be more boring and ‚Äúexpected‚Äù for Zophia to die, so that is precisely why I feel it is Gabi that was at least crushed. 

Tldr; My guesses from this episode after watching it twice and pausing way too many times: Annie is dead. Eren ate Annie. Gabi was crushed by a boulder. Falco will become the Armored Titan and will hate all people of Paradise.

This show is flipping incredible, and I‚Äôm left speechless after each and every episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cure4thitch,"At this stage, I too shall forego morals and cheer as Eren destroys everything in sight. Let's do this."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nikhil_Subba,Well! this is how Mappa studio replies to its haters who were questioning about CGI and all just like Eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the_predamn_timea,"With only Eren's resolve, you can win half the world. Damn that eye scene was amazing and everything after that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kartickjonty4,Reiner says he wants to die but survives while Willy tybur says that he doesn't want to die but dies!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sickassfooo,That was so intense. Paradis has fully become a rebel group. I am fully bias towards team Paradis  ofcourse but killing brain washed civilians does not sit right with me especially when Eren acknowledges theyre brainwashed. But I guess its just a small blip of payback for what‚Äôs been done to Paradis.
Sickassfooo,DarthDookieMan,"The point of killing innocents is not payback; it‚Äôs rather that they have to if they want to live, to save their world. Reiner attacked Paradis on someone else‚Äôs orders in order to save the world, and Eren will have to do the same, for the same reasons."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clumulus,"Damn, the Reiner angst just doesn't let up does it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dakels,So are Reiner and Falco dead?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nearby-County7333,I swear i thought that soldier who was leading pieck and porco away was armin but his voice sounds SO DIFFERENT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GWillHunting,Is Reiner dead from that explosion of Eren transforming?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,weeklyfiber88,"I feel bad for Reiner, I think he truly felt grief and that eren felt that they‚Äôre very similar to each other but now, he doesn‚Äôt have a choice or it will mean the end for his people, it‚Äôs too bad I think him and Reiner could genuinely be friends if war wasn‚Äôt the only option"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AK_Ghosheh,AOT has the worst and best cliffhangers ever I‚Äôm gonna die till a week passes by.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,elwatermelon,sooooo willy is dead right?
elwatermelon,sassyaspho,I think there way too much hype around his character to be dead in a matter of seconds
sassyaspho,shifty1032231,Honestly it would be a great move storywise for Willy to die by the hands of Eren and that the War Hammer Titan is someone else.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingKRhule,Am I the only one who think something seems a little off with Willy's story? If this were completely true why attack the island to try and claim the Founding Titan? Willy controls Marley so why attack Paradis when you know they are not a threat?
KingKRhule,Ahmed_Umar,"He said his Father ordered the attack on Paradise, not him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,batfastarddom,"Hands down probably best epsidoe of TV i've ever watched, just behind Ozymandias. I was pretty much gasping like a giddy little girl. What a fantastic show!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tempics,Was that soldier that dropped Pieck and Marcels brother Armin? I swear I saw the blonde hair
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Barbasthetalkingdog,Armin is back üòé
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZukosScar0219,"The whole colour scheme, music, and steady build-up throughout the episode just kept me on the edge of my seat (even though I'm a manga reader and knew what'll happen). That ending and Eren's Titan roar was just perfect!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dongrizzly41,That gard tho trapped Pek and Poco is definitely Armin. This is about to be epic af. I think all of the scouts are there as well. Wonder how they will react to EDM gear.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Videogamer2719,"Just a bit worried that Eren will make enemies will all of the world and kill civilians in his rampage that aren‚Äôt Marleyan, making Willy‚Äôs statement about Eren being a threat to everyone true. Making the inhabitants of the walls have more enemies than just Marley"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,youcancallmejb,"That roar and the look on Willys face gave me goosebumps!

Also... attack Titan looking significantly scarier this season."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PPHillips,So that was Armin right? Is he going to set off a nuke?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frokiedude,"WHAT THE FUCK EREN 

Amazing episode that completely changes the war going on. Instead og Marley vs Eldia its more like Marley vs Eren. Eren could solve the war by giving himself to the Marleyans lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Qsaaad1,"Why did the soldiers at the roof say ""Has it begun?"". Are they with eren. How did they knew something is starting"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Burtonpoelives,"My husband and I were shaking with anticiPation the whole time we watched this episode. Man if anything I want Reiner to live a good life. Poor boy deserves it.  Hearing Eren forgive him, and know that he did what he had to, makes me feel good. But when he was transforming I literally screamed. Reiner is the dad of this Season to those kids, and I love it and am so scared."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kartickjonty4,"I believe the tybur family is to blame for everything, when they knew that there was no threat from paradis island and had reasonable control on the affairs of Marley they should never have allowed the mission to go ahead 4 years ago."
kartickjonty4,hrdp453,"Completely agree. If Marley knew that Reiss would never use the Founding titan for declaring war, they would have no need to send the warriors. 

But also consider that Grisha would have had the Founding titan anyway and would hand it down to Eren regardless of Reiner's attack. Eren would've found out about Marley from Grisha's journals and who's to say would've happened then."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Trapnest_music,"I was really nervous about this episode , for me, this is the moment when AoT went from a really good story to one of the best stories I've ever seen!!! Mappa killed it !!!! After this episode there's no doubt in my mind they will do a great job with the rest .

My only wish is that Vogel Im Kafig started playing in the background when Eren transforms , it would have been perfect !"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shadowredlev,"Anyone know why Even did not remember himself saying ""I'll make you suffer in the worst way imaginable"" when Reiner asked him about it?"
shadowredlev,VaderJim,"It's not that be didn't remember, he'd just forgotten it, I believe it was to show that Reiner focused on that because of the guilt and Eren didn't because he isn't angry at Reiner, he's angry at Marley"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheLovelyStatic,"The SUSPENSE. As soon as Kruger showed up in this season I was like ""bro thats definitely Eren"". When he unwrapped his leg and it started to grow back it made me laugh because of how his foot came in. 

But the animation was so smooth, has been this entire season. Everything just looks so good!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MJohnRili,"I don't know if the netflix subs are correct but holy shit the wall is made up of ""tens of millions"" of colossal titans???

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LonelyWanderer28,"OK, so let me tell you all the freaking hairs on my body stood up and I literally jumped up and screamed ‚ÄúWOAH MY GOD‚Äù when Eren transformed. God, so freaking moving. I love it. I can‚Äôt wait for the next episode."

so that guy on thr stage explaining the history... can someone explain like I'm 5?

why is he an Eldian working with the oppressive government?

Sooo... the hero Helo was made up?

what part of the history is true?

he's was going on about revealing the truth?

he's still on the bad side right?"
Grifter56,No3sc4pe,"1) He literally is the oppressive government. The Tyburs are pretty much the rulers fo Marley.

2) My guess is as good as anyones since im anime only too, but i think that the told the truth of how Paradis came to be. It fit in perfectly with what we learned about the Founding Titan through Kenny, Grisha and Reiss. I think that history might have transposed exactly as Tybur told it.

3) I dont think there really is a bad side anymore. Marley tries to destroy Paradis because of ressources and Titan powers and in return the scouts are about to commit genocide. Who is right? Who is wrong? Eren said that there are good and bad people on both sides and both sides are or were victims of large scale brain washing. It i sup to you to decide who to cheer for and what side to support. This is the true genius of S4"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,My_Nama_Jeff1,What the fuck there‚Äôs no way eren can eat tyber like that right??

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DasOddie,I had fun watching today's episode the day it dropped! I have been catching up since episode one for a couple weeks now. This totally feels like the beginning of the end~
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,theleho,"I know this is a stupid question, as my memory isn‚Äôt too fresh on the earlier seasons, but can Eren transform at will anytime after he‚Äôs cut himself? I thought the deal was you transform straight after you make the cut"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DamoBot,Are falco and reiner dead? They were next to Eren while he transformed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bshave02,The goosebumps titan has AWAKENED!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GucciAddict,Its really nice to see Eren move like a Yeager again. Jokes aside THE HYPE IS REAL AND IT'S BIGGER THAN COLLOSAL TITAN AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT EPISODE GOD DAMMIT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SnooSquirrels4205,Did anyone else get GOT vibes from that episode? Especially the wild fire scene at the church.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JthePlanet,That intro song hit different this episode. So good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jaesic,"Wait so is Willy telling the truth when he warns the ppl of Marley that the eldians on paradis island have 100s of colossal titans at their disposal to attack Marley? Couldn‚Äôt really tell how much of what he was saying was truth, speculation, or lies."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jd_grime,"Eren ain‚Äôt playing no games. For his homeland to have peace of mind, this needs to happen !!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mastermaze,"Wait wait wait....if Eren yeated Willbur right after transforming presumably to contain the warhammer titan, when did he not also eat Reiner right there too?? Was that his way of forgiving/punishing Reiner? Letting him live to see the total destruction of his home like he did to Eren?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Padfoot2020,"I still don't quite understand Marley's motives.  If the Tybur family controls Marley and knows about King Fritz's true motives (assuming that whole speech was true), what reason do they have for sending Titans towards Paradis Island?  The whole chain of events for this series hinges on Marley sending out Titans for over a hundred years and then eventually send the 4 human titans in a mission to steal the Founding Titan.  If the Tybur family already knew that the King wanted to remain peaceful, then what reason did they have for doing any of this?  I could maybe see how the reason for attacking wall Maria was an effort to stop Grisha Yeager's mission to take the Founding Titan, but even that seems unlikely given that its unlikely that Marley would know of Grisha's plan, and it has been stated that Marley attacked Wall Maria to lure out the King.  Even if that is the reason for attacking Wall Maria, it still doesn't explain why they baraged Paradis with titans for 100 years."
Padfoot2020,No3sc4pe,"You answered your own question: to take the founding titan. The fouding titan is incredibly powerfull if owned by the right bloodline. When Marleys military supremacy was declining they needed the founding titan even more urgently to retain their position of power.
Furthermore Paradis is very rich with ressources. Those are also important to Marley."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LezTalkz,Anyone catch the scene with Pieks and the Panzer unit? The panzer unit are Marleys that ride on the cart titan into battle....but why were they acting so weird?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chanj3,The night is a dark attack and full of titan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,taskkill-IM,"Can someone just clear something up for me so I'm not misunderstanding...

Willy's character so far up until this episode (to me) has come across like a good guy who wants to end the war on titans and proclaim peace...

His big reveal at the festival was telling the truth about his family and King Fritz manufacturing a Marleyian hero who concured the demon Eldian's..

As far as I know Marleyian's basically have war in their DNA so any hopes of peace is pretty much a crap shot, they live to fight, as much as we've seen in flashbacks this season where they used Armoured, Colossal, Jaw and female titan to ""flatten a nation"" before attacking paradise Island..
This season has also shown them also at war with another nation, so their end game is to obtain all titans and rule the world right?

Onto Willy, he clearly knows this is Marley's intentions and it seems to be that he's rallying everyone up to see Eren as the common enemy right?
His whole speech about how Eren is the destructor of the world just seems like away to get all nations on Marley's side?

Have I pretty much got the jist of it as I tend to overlook some details."
taskkill-IM,CloudMafia9,You are spot on. He used Eren as an excuse (because Eren has the founding titan) to rally the nations together to attack paradis.
CloudMafia9,taskkill-IM,"Makes more sense of my theory that Marleyian's are just violent by nature then... Eldian's seem to be a more reserved submissive race where as Marleyian's feel the need to constantly be at war with someone to fulfil q genetic purpose..

It confuses me that we were told early that Eldian's enslaved the Marleyian's and used the titans to perform pretty much genocide on the Marleyian race, even though the truth was that the Eldian's used the titans to prosper, build roads, bridges, buildings etc.. 

So I'm confused to as why the story fabricated by King Fritz and the Tybur's seemed like a good idea??

Maybe they are yet to reveal the true nature of the story, or I may have missed something but clearly the Tyburn family are the instigators, possibly due to mixed Eldian and Marleyian blood? Is this a product of what happens when Eldian's and Marleyian's breed together?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nikolas_101,I have a feeling that the guy that led the pieck to the pit was armin with a painted on beard because on the hair color but im not sure
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Inanimate_art,"Don't get me wrong, the episode was amazing and I'm sure whatever is to come will be epic, but tbh, I'm a bit sad about how it played out, the way I see it this episode made any chance of a happy ending seem pretty unlikely. In the end Eren saying he and Reiner were the same wasn't him putting aside their differences so they could work together, it was just him saying that he understood why he did it now and accepted that he's no better than him. I was really hoping that Eren and Reiner would convince everyone that the people on the island weren't the devils they'd been taught they were, of course that would have been more underwhelming because there would have been a lot less action but idk, I was really just hoping for a happy ending because there are characters that I like on both side of the conflict and the whole thing has just been caused by false information, if everyone could take the time to understand each other they'd realize there's no need to fight at all, its just tragic that so many people are going to die over basically a misunderstanding. Everyone in this show has been through so much and it'd be nice for things to start looking up in the end but now I cant see how it could end without one side being completely eradicated. Also, even though Reiner feels incredibly guilty, I still cant see him choosing to fight against Marley, where his own family is, if it comes down to either destroying Marley or Paradis, so it's unlikely I'll see Eren and Reiner team up like I was hoping for. It's getting hard for me to root for anyone in this show at this point, I still really like the characters and understand their motivations but i still just cant root for someone who's goal is to wipe out entire nations of people. Anyway, thats just my feelings about it, sorry if it's incoherent, I was basically just typing as thoughts came to my head."
Inanimate_art,CloudMafia9,"Mate happy ending? When has isayama's writing ever implied that.  
Just keep an open mind as you go forward."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gamerz905,Holy fucking shit!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rayanator69,I hope we get some flashbacks to the past 4 years
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Edgy0515,"I‚Äôm not so sure if this is true or not but it‚Äôs most likely that the tall soldier is Armin. We saw that he was blonde, had blue eyes, but most importantly that he was tall. Why tall is important is because Armin inherited the Colossal Titan, and like most Titan Hosts, they take their Titans traits and make it their own, explaining the extreme height of the soldier."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,p4rthm,But why Eren going for war? Isn't the peace is the end goal?
p4rthm,Skankalite,Probably because Marley is intent on exterminating humanity within the walls
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kapi_M4A1,Animate only here. I know as viewers we support eren and understand why he had to do this. But won't the world just see this as a terrorist attack and further villify them? Somehow they need to get their perspective out to the world. That should be priority for them and offer sanctuary for all eldians suffering across the world. Maybe that's were the story is heading. Also I'm very keen to see what has happened in paradis during the time skip!
Kapi_M4A1,LlamaLegacy,"Good observation, it‚Äôll definitely be explored more in the future. For now though, notice how Eren waited till Willy declared war to attack. He didn‚Äôt want to, but after all the counties in the world are rallied against paradis, he chose to make the first move in the situation he was in"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DumbLikeColumbo,So that soldier that lead pieck and galliard away is arnim right?? So how did he get so tall? Does acquiring the colossal titan also make you tall lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,romanNood1es,"Eren forgave Reiner for the actions he committed, but Reiner is still the enemy and Eren has to keep moving forward."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_Paths,Wonder whats going on with eren and the eye thing; in his human form he always kept it hidden but when transforming it was a different color from their usual green; if anime has taught me anything some wacky shit is about to go on

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kpt_krish,"I really liked the episode, but knowing that he was going to kill innocent people isn't something that I actually was expecting from eren. Yeah I get the idea of reiner doing the same thing, and eren doing it to them, he's forced to and all of that, but this just doesn't seem satisfactory for me to think that the protagonist that we all seem to love for has now got nothing to separate him from the enemy. I mean yeah they are the same, but the villain and the hero are not meant to be the same right?"
kpt_krish,Ahmed_Umar,"That's the point, there are no Heros or Villans in this world,  just people."
Ahmed_Umar,kpt_krish,But that's not how the world is... Atleast that's not how the aot world is portrayed either. There clearly are bad guys and good guys. Why the gray areas now?
kpt_krish,hrdp453,"Willie just declared war on Paradis. Eren has no choice, like he said to Reiner. If he doesn't attack Marley now, they will attack and kill the rest of the islanders."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,redditer954,Was that Armin who led Pieck and Galliard to the trap?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Charmingly_Conniving,Ok so who's the warhammer? Cant be ol' willy can it?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OldBirth,"What a fucking episode. Jaded, dead-eyed, ruthless Erin may have just become one of my favorite characters in all of Anime. And I've never been a big Erin fan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,theFinesser00,"So, Tybur goes on this whole spiel about how the people on Paradis Island shouldn‚Äôt be blamed for anything, but then says they need to wipe them out? Confused"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,saarthakk,"I was on the edge the whole time , got so hyped I started jumping man . So good and I am sure there's more to come."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,doctormcdonald,"Okay so idk if this is reaching but based on the glow in eren‚Äôs eyes when he transformed it seems he‚Äôs been able to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù at least some of the founding Titan‚Äôs powers, yeah? I have a theory that perhaps the blood on eren‚Äôs hand was historia‚Äôs...? Because we know that Eren is able to access the coordinate when coming in to contact with some one with royal blood so to me it would make sense... if anyone has any info (anime only) that could back this up or discredit it please let me know."
doctormcdonald,Phodo_Hatchbackins,Either he‚Äôs unlocked some of the power on his own or Reiner has royal blood ü§î
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sliphatos,"It's sad it had to come to all of this. If anything, these people should be working together, not killing each other. Ignorance built from lies on both sides is preventing them from seeing each other as allies in their real fight for survival. 
 
And more people are going to continue to die because of it, many of which who will never fully understand why as they are turned into a decoration of war: human confetti."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,irunspeed,The whole episode was üî•üî• . That said I had a problem with willy saying how they were bad guys all along and then in the same sentence go but fuck that we declare war anyway .

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cdntrooper19,Eren could‚Äôve made peace there but he waited until Willy declared war so it isn‚Äôt his fault. Scumbag
Cdntrooper19,LlamaLegacy,"You‚Äôve got it backwards, Eren didn‚Äôt want to attack until Willy confirmed that the rest of the world would be hunting down Paradis. After that moment, there was no hope for peace so he chose to strike first and make do with the situation he was in"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AznDumplingMafia,"I didn‚Äôt see this question already asked - if that trap that Pieck and Porco fell into was too narrow for them to transform, then why was that small room Eren was in fine?"
AznDumplingMafia,LlamaLegacy,"It‚Äôs not that they couldn‚Äôt transform, they just didn‚Äôt want to because they would crush each other. Eren doesn‚Äôt care if he crushes Reiner or any of the people in the building"
LlamaLegacy,AznDumplingMafia,"Okay, that makes sense. I didn‚Äôt think of it from that angle."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shan_uu,How did eren transform into titan without cutting his hand?
Shan_uu,dongrizzly41,His had was already cut. He can either control his abilities that well now or him touching reiner activated his transformation somehow.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Warliss,"Now that we've seen a good amount from the Marley side, I was just thinking. 
It seems they never acknowledge , strategize for, or identify the Attack titan or his owner. 
Was he always in the hands of the Eldian rebels? How has he remained hidden?(the Owl left no witnesses, and they know ""now"" due to Reiner). 

A scenario comes to mind...

Two Marleyan generals sitting in an office listening to Willy's speech...

Gen1: ""Willy talking 'bout the old days"" 

Gen2: ""Speaking of the old days, remember that Attack titan dude""

Gen1: ""Oh yeah, what ever happened to that guy?""

Gen2: ""Last I heard he was down in Tampa with a wife and two kids""...""Running a lumber business, don't even need a chainsaw, pulling the trees right out of the ground... Can you believe that shit!

BOOOOMMM!      ROOOOAAAARRRRRRR!

As the building collapses, and they fall to their death, they point at each other with a look of horror and acknowledgement yelling,

""DUDE!"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dongrizzly41,I wonder what that ambassador who left angle on all this is. She is obviously in on the attack but how so and are there other sympathizers?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dumbass1171,The ending was amazing. The music!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FAILURES_IDEA289,This episode was just woww . ... It was out of this world . The animation was very smooth and an outstanding job done by the VA . But the main thing about this episode was tybur's speech . His VA nailed it . As always it is fun to see eren . We have now starting to see his growth . Also they slit foreshadowing that they are doing here for the future is just amazing. Loved it .....ü§©ü§©
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,metrize,"WTF what an episode. I have one massive question though, is Eren actually going to exterminate everyone or is he actually allied with Reiner etc, and he's just protecting himself before things get fixed?"
metrize,honeywings,"I have a feeling he‚Äôs going to kill everyone. He personally doesn‚Äôt want to do it, he sympathizes with Reiner and Falco. He used to demonize them the same way Marley demonizes Paradis but after living among them as a spy he realizes they are just oppressed and manipulated second class citizens doing what they can to survive. He can‚Äôt fault them for that and even forgives Reiner for the death of his mother. However a common theme of this show is survival and at the end of nearly everyone‚Äôs life, they are terrified to die and have strong determination to live. So in order for Eren and his friends to live, he must eradicate Marley and everyone in it even if he personally does not want to."
honeywings,metrize,"I hope they explore this more, would be a bit of a let down if this episode was all there if he just kills everyone and calls it a day"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Urnbreon,"I think at the end Eren said  ‚Äúwe were born this way‚Äù and ‚ÄúI have to keep moving forward‚Äù because Reiner talked about how the other warriors wanted to turn back and quit after Marcel died, but Reiner had to keep moving forward and continue his mission. Eren really understands Reiner and empathizes with him on that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Positive_Magician_52,"Yo guys, I've been wondering, is the guy who lead the warrior candidates away actually Armin??? He is blonde, kinda sounds like him and the Cart Titan (Pieck) remembers him maybe back from when she was on the island. Can he be pulling of his 200IQ moves already? 

What do you guys think? Anime only here btw."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I_am_Feli,"My theory:

Willy Tybur or SOMEONE within the Tybur family is working with Eren and they planned out to have this whole speech and everything to make him look like the bad guy, for the Marleans (and the rest of the world) to understand and FEEL what the Eldians on Paradis had to go trough, so that with the help of the Kiyomi (forgot her last name, the japanese woman) they can break the cycle so to speak and end the ongoing war and back and forth between the Eldians and everyone else, the Marleans specially.

Remember, the asians (or just japanese, not sure) and the Ackermanns can not be controlled by the founding Titan. King Fritz was not able to brainwash them. They KNOW something!

The story Willy Tybur told everyone today, is NOT the FULL truth! There is still something hidden within the whole Royal Family meaning BOTH Tyburs and King Fritz! 

It looks like Kiyomi is on Willy Tyburs side and the Tyburs are against Eren but I think all 3 are working together! They ALL know there is a key part missing that was not told to the public.

I dont know what it is, I would have to rewatch the whole show and figure it out, but so far, this is my theory."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kitsune-oni,"Couple of thoughts. 

1) Armin with beard. Armin has a beard. Bearded Armin. 

2) These first five episodes have made me feel so much for Reiner that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. Like homie just constantly has it rough and can never catch a break. He was doing what he thought was right. If anything its the Marleys fault. So...

3) Why can't Eren just scoop of the Eldians in Marley and have them all live in Paradis? It seems like a reasonable idea. Eldians in Marley are treated poorly ans they'll never be ""equal."" But by moving to Paradis and joining forces together, they could be equal. Given, the islanders would probably resent the Eldians, but its better than living in Marley, right? 

4) And why pit Titans/Eldians/Paradis Islanders together? Yall are the exact same. I kinda hope Falco sees that (if he's still alive) and tries to bring everyone together. The Titan race could literally take over the world if they wanted to. So why do the Marlyean Titans stand by Marley so much if they're mistreated? I understand its for their families. But do they not see that there's so much in common between them and Paradis? Is ""Paradis = Bad"" just so far ingrained in their minds at this point?

Idk man I'm hyped. I might go ahead and read the manga because I don't think I can wait."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IustinKing,"Disclaimer: I didn't read any manga, so everything I think will happen is all from my little imagination.

SO, where do we start:

\-The moment Eren transforms: EPIC. What can I say? When I saw yellow particles I said in my mind: ""This is gonna be AWESOME!"". I think Eren's eye in close up must be some kind of message. Why did his eye shine blue? Is there any meaning behind it? We will see in future episodes I guess  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 

\-The Jaw Titan and the Cart Titan got ""captured""(more trapped I guess). This event isn't ***THAT*** important, but the thing that got me fired up is Armin. Like, dude, is Armin. And not any Armin...... Colosal Titan Armin, after 4 years of having it's power. And btw, nice beard he got there! D:

\-Zeke. What the hell is Zeke doing? Eren planned the attack (probably), and trapped Falco and Pieck, BUT what about Zeke? I know he is more of a ""long range"" Titan, by using his powerfull throws, but for real, where is he, and what will he do about an Angry Eren killing hundreds of people? 

\-One more thing about Eren. I'm surprized how much he ""evolved"". Like you could see that he mastered controlling his super fast regeneration and he got wiser. I say this because, he didn't do anything stupid. I mean, old Eren ( like season 3 Eren) would have just punched Reiner to death in that underground room. Instead, season 4 Eren had a *conversation* with him. That line:  ""I just keep moving forward""  , was just GENIUS.

That's pretty much it about what i wanted to say about this episode. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Oh? Eren will talk with War Hammer titan in the next episode? Eh.... cool.... I guess ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
m_e_m_e_lord,hrdp453,"Pieck spied on the scouts when they were on their way to retake shiganshina in S3. That's the only time she saw Armin, if I'm not wrong?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fppfpp,"Getting to hear Reiner's emotions come to life brought me to tears. Isayama did such a good job writing for Reiner.

Top comments here are not as blood thirsty as the CrunchyRoll crowd.  Idk if that's normal for this sub.  It's somewhat surprsing.  ..but, ppl ironically miss the points of this episode that Isayama setup since the manga. Eren didnt just kill ppl who were actively taking up arms against Paradis. He also killed completely innocent ppl (obvy including children). It's a tragedy for everyone. Anime onlys are barely getting a first taste, too."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,james2164,What power does the war hammer titan have?
james2164,Ahmed_Umar,A war hammer.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thaivietdung,"I know obviously that Reiner and Flaco doesn‚Äôt getsmashed to death in the end but can someone explain to me how?
Edit: typo"
thaivietdung,LlamaLegacy,"Well, eren is not the only titan shifter in the room"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brusalise,"just a thing i noticed, in your typical shonen series what happens is villens go on offensive path and heroes are like i reject you path and fuck them up and make peace. 

what happened here is they accepcted their war and raise to with a fucking attack with massive killings. like heroes saying villens i understand why you fucked us up and now i am gonna fuck you up, lets continue until everyones dead."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,khoaticpeach,Yo I‚Äôm waiting for Levi to come fuck shit up!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaninenlove,So is Eren the bad guy? I personally see him as straight up evil if i interpreted all that correctly. Killing many civillians including his friend just to eat the guy who declared war for very good reasons.
Kaninenlove,chipthehippie,"Idk how the point couldn't have been clear during their conversation lol.

Eren isn't evil. Neither is Bert, Reiner, or Annie. They're all oppressed, and doing what they must to ""save the world"" even if it means destroying innocents along the way. 

It could be argued that Eren was radicalized by Bert and Reiner's terrorism, causing him to become a counter-terrorist (as with real world wars), so it all comes down to the ideal of ""can you really blame them?"".

If Eren doesn't attack Liberio/Marley, then Liberio/Marley will just come attack them again and do the same thing. Innocents will die regardless, so Eren is simply there to win at all costs and fight for freedom and to ""save the world""."
Kaninenlove,cheesyvoetjes,"I don't think it is that simple. The Marleyans attacked first by sending Reiner and the rest to the island. The island wasn't even aware of them or Eldian's past misdeeds. They were just minding their own business and trying to stay alive from the titans that Marley kept sending. You could make the argument they were innocent. Again, they didn't know anything. They didn't even know they were Eldian. Reiner or even Zeke could have reported that back to Marley. They didn't, they still chose to attack. And now we see this speech by Tybur announcing that the world has to unite to destroy the Island. So what would you do if you were Eren? They will eventually come. The power of titans will always be a threat. So would you just roll over and die? Or would you fight back? I don't think Eren is evil for not wanting to die. Yeah innocent civilians will get killed, but Marley started that the day they breached the wall. Eren's mom was also an innocent civilian."
cheesyvoetjes,Kaninenlove,"Eren knows at this point that all Marley wants is peace from the evil supervillian Eren Jeager but his first reaction is to give in to the war and start a terror attack on the people he, as he admitted a second before, knows is just like anyone else. Giving into rage and revenge is excactly the kind of corruption arc i hoped Eren would have"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Acernis_6,"I dont understand, why don't the inhabitants of Paradis try for peace and make it known that they dont have to fight? Its literally eldians vs the world so it seems like trying NOT to fight and to get the word to understand they aren't a threat is a better motive"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KillSwitch111183838,"in this chapter in the manga, eren looked more intimidating and reiner looked more horrified which made it better in my opinion... but mappa fucking nailed it in this episode so well done to them"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dafuqis_goinon,Guys I really don‚Äôt understand why Eren is the villain ???
dafuqis_goinon,Zenkikid,IMO nobody is really right or wrong here. Both sides were lied to. Its just a sad situation all around.
Zenkikid,dafuqis_goinon,Agreed and it‚Äôs really close to reality
dafuqis_goinon,chipthehippie,"He's not the villain. He's attacking the villains, who are framing him as the villain in order to achieve world conquest."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mydogsamy,"Let's goooo! We finally have Armin! They called him a ""scrawny soldier""

How could it not be him"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,warm_battery_acid,"This may sound stupid but how did eren transform without self harm, I though that was the only way to transform"
warm_battery_acid,No3sc4pe,Most likely what the cut in his hand was for
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,irohswhitelotus,Am i the only one who feels like things have been too confusing
irohswhitelotus,dongrizzly41,Naww I love it! Building Emotions in a show like this needs some complexity but its still followable.
irohswhitelotus,daroons,Yes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Woken12245,Can someone explain the episode a little bit to me? I‚Äôm confused. I thought for whatever reason this episode was in a different timeline than eren yeagers time line. Why does eren Kruger want to kill all the Marleyans. Sorry if I sound stupid it‚Äôs just been getting a little confusing
Woken12245,RejwanMiahXO,Please tell me you are joking
Woken12245,derpface360,haha dude did you just like ... go to sleep during the last few episodes of season 3?
Woken12245,poenis,season 4 takes places 4(?) years after season 3! i hope that clears up any confusion. i recommend watching the new aot movie that reviews everything up to season 3.
Woken12245,Periidot,"That‚Äôs not kruger thats yeager, erens just using the name kriger as a cover"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,genitalvegetable,Was the soldier that led Porco and Pieck into the trap floch?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kollarb,"So after rewatching all the tall soldier scenes and pausing on the frame that shows his face, I was thinking who the hell that might be. I think I got it. 

I want to state that I am an anime watcher only, I know nothing about the manga, I wouldn‚Äôt act as I know nothing for some internet points, I just want to talk about my theory. But if it‚Äôs correct then this could be a major plot point and it could ruin the surprise. So please stop reading if you want to go in blind. Maybe I am wrong, but now that I think about it, it‚Äôs quite obvious.

So I think the soldier is indeed Armin... and Annie.
The soldier is very tall so if we assume that a shifter phisically changes if they acquire a titan then that would explain that it is Armin because he ate Bertholt and grew in size.
Also Armin has blonde hair, the shape of the face is kinda similar, the voice is weird but it could have gotten deeper over 4 years.

So why do I think it isn‚Äôt that simple?
Two things: Pieck recognized him, and the shot where we see his face. Also kinda the fake beard, but maybe he can‚Äôt grow one, big deal.

The biggest clue for me are the long eyelashes. They are VERY feminine. That‚Äôs when I suspected Annie but all the other factors are pointing towards Armin.

So I think Armin ate Annie and got the Female titan from her. It would explain everything. That‚Äôs why he has these feminine eyes, that‚Äôs why he can‚Äôt grow a beard and that‚Äôs why Pieck recognized him (Pieck only saw Armin as a burnt body).

I really don‚Äôt know why Armin would eat Annie if he already possesses the Colossal but I guess we will find out.

What do you guys think? I think this is the only explanation right now, it just adds up."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,atomicbreathmint,So did Eren share memories with Reiner at the end?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AcousticAtlas,I‚Äôve never turned on a character faster than I just did with Eren.
AcousticAtlas,DOOMFOOL,Yeah characters who risk everything to protect their homes and loved ones from the genocidal world totally suck
DOOMFOOL,AcousticAtlas,"Jesus dude I get it. You like protecting murderers. Please stop going through my comments. You look pathetic lol.

You act like the Eldians dont also think the paradisians are going to kill them. That‚Äôs the fucking POINT you neanderthal"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,antrix_AFC,"SO THE TALL ASS BODYGUARD OF WILLY TYBUR IS THE WAR HAMMER!?

Could be wrong but (1) he was in the room when Willy said to Magath that the war hammer is in the room and (2) He turned towards the side during his performance today and said ""Watch my resolve"" and the only people standing there was the woman (probably the wife) and the tall ass security. All the others were actors hired for the show and were all absent from the room as well."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"Maybe I‚Äôm dumb, but when exactly did Eren get the founding titans powers. I have a feeling it has something to do when his father was in that crystal cave, but I‚Äôm not sure."
Johnny20022002,DeadZeus007,Ur not dumb but... It was explained in great details and multiple times that Erens father stole the Founding Titan and so Eren got that Titan when he ate his father. Dno how you missed that. It's a huge plotpoint...
DeadZeus007,Skitzofreniq,Wait. So Eren has the Attack Titan AND the Founding Titan?
Johnny20022002,Zenkikid,Eren basically had 2 titans inside of him the entire time thanks to eating his dad who had the founding titan.
Johnny20022002,hrdp453,"Like others said, Eren got both Attack Titan and Founding Titan from his father. But he cannot channel the founding titan's true powers (coordinate, memories etc.) because he doesn't have royal blood. But at the end of S2, he made contact with Dina Fritz's titan, the one who ate his mom, and was able to access the founding titan powers aka the scream. Same thing at the end of S3 when he touched Historia and was able to access memories."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,humm1010,"The soldier is Levi, cuz Levi was the only one ripping thru all the Titian before the cart Titian saved zeke, can‚Äôt wait to see Levi with a beard"
humm1010,FlawlessCowboy94,"Levi is 5'2"" and that soldier is easily 6'
It's not levi unless he's on stilts lol"
FlawlessCowboy94,Phantombk201,Levi on Mikasa ;)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Slaughterpig09,Was that marleyen soldier Annie?
Slaughterpig09,DoctorDK,I think it was Armin...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BJoe004,Im sad that eren got CGI. But the episode was fire Af
BJoe004,kitsune-oni,Honestly I can't even tell. The new studio is honestly exceeding my expectations. I'm glad it still feels like how it did back in 2013.
kitsune-oni,BJoe004,Everything feels good expect the cgi. I have seen so much better cgi than this but hopefully they will do something about it or just change it for the main fight scenes back to drawing
BJoe004,sassyaspho,Stop complaining about the CGI already and accept that it was amazing
sassyaspho,BJoe004,"Why would i stop, its bad they did a good job with like everything else but the cgi titans"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,righteousforest,"Okay I have no idea if this is a Mappa thing or a subs vs dubs thing, but... I've been watching the dub up until this season (I couldn't wait!) and previously Eren's titan had this super intimidating, blood-curdling wail and in this episode he just... his titan sounds like a stereotypical deep-voiced doofus character going ""DUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHH"" XD It made me start laughing while Eren was wrecking everyone"
righteousforest,chipthehippie,"His roar has always been the same. If you're talking about his high pitched pterodactyl screech, that's definitely a result of the dub."
chipthehippie,righteousforest,"Yeah I think that must be it since I'd expect to see others mentioning it if it was a Mappa thing. I wish the original Japanese ""roar"" sounded more like an actual roar as opposed to a weird moan :-/"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"Man, I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who was let down by this episode.  I felt like it was mostly a whole lot of nothing.  Like the entire episode was:

- Falco realizes Eren is from Paradis  
- ‚ÄúReiner, I‚Äôm like you, I forgive you.‚Äù   
- ‚ÄúKing Fritz was actually cool, Helios is a lie.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWe declare war anyway.‚Äù  
- Titan attack  

Like it just felt like a lot of filler and not much progression... but tons of people are saying it‚Äôs their favorite episode.  Am I missing something?

EDIT: rather than just downvoting me, would you mind telling me something I may have missed that would make me appreciate the episode more?  I honestly feel like I listed out every important moment in the entire episode."
SHADOWSTRIKE1,SnorchYT,"A whole lot of nothing? That's just straight-up wrong. We learn:  


* The 'true' story of the great titan war and why the world needs to band together to attack Paradis.
* Erens goal and motivation and also changed outlook and personality
* A literal declaration and start of the war
* How similar Eren and Renier are
* Willy's death (most likely)
* Warhammer Vs Eren tease (preview)

How is this not progression and how is it nothing?"
SHADOWSTRIKE1,Shiloh_Moon,"Honestly I felt a bit underwhelmed since everyone kept hyping this episode up to the extremes, but I also watched it kind of sleepy and tired so I‚Äôm gonna try watching it again with more energy lol."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pettyhonor,I wonder if we are gonna see Levi next episode... or any of the other scouts. This was a really good episode and next weeks will be just as good im sure
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ok-Ask-7718,So who do you think war hammer titan is?
Ok-Ask-7718,Y2KN,The grandpa
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zackywacky123321,Is the next episode going to be delayed?
zackywacky123321,Ahmed_Umar,No.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Anthonee00,If the soldier is Armin isn‚Äôt it suicidal to have him so close to Eren and his squad if they‚Äôre nearby!? I believe just transforming can instantly destroy everything in a 5 mile radius.
Anthonee00,Ahmed_Umar,"The collosal titan can choose if it wants to explode or not, similar to how Berthold didn't explode qhen he transformed in season 1 and 2."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Helltrim,"How did the Tybur family know Eren Jaeger had the founding Titan? If this is a spoiler, you can dm me. Thanks in advance."
Helltrim,Ahmed_Umar,Reiner told the military everything he knew when he came back.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ronaszn567,What happened to Zeke when he was split off from Porco and Pieck
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mannykiid,What chapter is this episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jojo_not10,Was that Armin?!?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mealprep_throwaway,"So, that soldier was Armin right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DemonicLemon02,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cold_Leadership,Did reiner die btw when he transform?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Empoleon_Master,"In the words of my friend, ""there are no words, only screams"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Throwaway5849201,"Anyone else see the parallel when Eren's eyes flash when Willy talks about ""being born this way"", possibly thinking about himself in the ice chapel, self-loathing about his sins in front of Historia? I think he found something in common with Willy. 

Also, does anyone else think Willy might be the Warhammer Titan? In the last panel, Willy's eyes are dark. Characters' eyes become like that when things are about to get serious. If you look at the scene where Eren fake falls with the PTSD Marleyan guy, his eyes were dark as well. I feel like Willy is too interesting of a character to be killed off right away. Thoughts?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tomgabe22,Who was the person that cut the rope and trapped porco and pieck? They showed his face and pieck even mentioned she recognised him twice so i think it must be from the 9 that survived season 3 part 2. I thought it would be armin but the eyes are a different colour. Any thoughts?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AbaramaGolding,"Yo where tf is ZEKE? They showed us 2 of the Titans in the hole, but they didn't show us what they did with the beast titan!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheZeBode,"I hope falko isn't dead, I really like him"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lodreus503,"23minutes feels like 15 minutes, and it wasn't enough! I wish these episodes were longer seeing as it's the last season. While I have been an Anime viewer from the very start a part of me wants to read the Manga because of how close we are to the ending! But the Manga doesn't give me that itch like the Anime does T\^T.

I'm happy to see Reiner on his knees understanding what has happened over the years and how Eren sees it all. I have mixed feelings about how Eren sees Reiner after all these years and I hope Eren doesn't get soft over-time which is something I hope writers avoid! Reiner deserves no mercy after what has happened in the previous season.

I really like the part where Tybur's last few words were the nail in the coffin for Eren to go all-out. It definitely fits the moment."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TitusVI,I wonder if the hammer titan was the grandma then next episode he fights grandma or grandpa. lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dongrizzly41,Wow! That was alot! And exactly what I thought would happen did. Love this show!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dsb0208,"Can someone elaborate on the scene where Pieck hugged a guy? We‚Äôre those her their 3 simps? Porco says she ‚Äúwedged a hole in the friendship‚Äù or something, so does that mean her hugging the one guy means they‚Äôre all gonna turn on each other?

Also, Canonically this episode is where ‚Äúpastime with Pieck‚Äù takes place"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Renatodep,Holy shit! What a perfection of an episode! WOW...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RitroBlade,at the end of the episode did Eren eat Reiner after transforming?
RitroBlade,derpface360,"Nah, he grabbed and is attempting to eat Willy."
derpface360,RitroBlade,oh thanks!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,No-Blueberry4158,That solider that led the Rider and Jaw titan to the trap was Armin wasn't it?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pratham2003,Fuckin amazing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Liuete,"So Reiner and Falco just died? Falco can't die just like that, he appears at the ending credits, he must have a bigger role to accomplish.

In the last scene seems like Eren is about to eat Willy (who is pretty injured) you mean he is able to transform into titan? If that's the case Eren did a poor job, instead of throwing him into the air should've directly eaten him.  Or is the hammer titan another member of his family? 

&#x200B;

(anime only watcher here)"
Liuete,No3sc4pe,I dont think Willy is the warhammer titan but since we cant be sure Eren eats him just in case. I dont think Reiner and Falco died here. You can see Reiner shielding Falco with his body before Eren transfroms and even though Eren destroyed the house that the cellar was under i dont see a reason for two main character to be killed off off-screen
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kia_May,Great episode! Question that I have pertains to Eren‚Äôs hand that appears to have a cut on it and covered in blood. Why?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xtivity,Why did Eren touch Rainer's hand ant the end just before transforming?
xtivity,powerfulaura,To open his wound to transform
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pretentious_bat,Okay but who do you guys think committed suicide???? Why was it important? At first I thought it was Reiner for sure
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JordanII,"Haven't even read the manga, but i can just tell they absolutely nailed this. The tension throughout the entire episode was insane"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pretentious_bat,What the hell do you guys think Zeke has been meeting with them about without his superiors knowing? Remember that line about meeting in other rooms?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BasedRomo,How they going to make me wait a week after that?? Pretty sure the tall soldier was Armin. Ugh I can‚Äôt wait for next Sunday!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pretentious_bat,"How do you think Eren was able to keep his leg cut off without healing instantly? Cause that threw me off. Also damn I should rewatch the scene with his grandpa, cause that‚Äôs fucked up. Lol I‚Äôm so sad for everyone"
Pretentious_bat,Finnsen17,titan shifter can control if they want to heal or not. The problem is that they cant Transform into titans when they are busy healing. This is why eren healed his leg first before transforming into a titan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zachariusTM,Holy shit the payoff in this season is so worth it even if the first few episodes were a little slow.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BleedingEdge61104,I thought Eren can‚Äôt use the full ability of the Founding Titan cause he‚Äôs not of Reiss blood?
BleedingEdge61104,markevans7799,He didn't use the founding titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Short-Flatworm1210,Blue-balled yet again
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BleedingEdge61104,This is gonna sound stupid but is Eren‚Äôs goal really to wipe out the entire world?
BleedingEdge61104,LlamaLegacy,"To others, it's wiping out the entire world. But to him and the Eldians on Paradis, it's to ""save the world"". After seeing all the nations team up with Marley, Eren knew that it was only a matter of time before they would attack Paradis, so he simply made the first move"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Silent_Glass,Ok so who could be that scrawny guy whom pieck said he looked familiar??
Silent_Glass,camerose,100% Armin.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bambam_39,"Falco man, he‚Äôll never trust again"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,somalipilates,"I thought being in confined spaces (especially underground) isn't conducive for people to turn into titans
That's why Annie was led to the underground tunnel and pieck was trapped in that well.

So why is Eren OK to transform without hindrance? Have I missed something"
somalipilates,Finnsen17,i think the room eren was in is easier to break then the trap pieck was in. Eren wanted to meet reiner in that basement bcs he knew reiner would kill all those ppl if he transforms. And Eren's titan has way more destruktive force then pieck's.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Qodrr,"Help me out here. Willy said ""Colossal Titan: The Rumbling"", does that mean Eren can command the titans inside the walls?  


Also: Does eren know how to use the Founding Titan powers yet?  
(Please spoil me with a hidden tag, as I'm a anime watcher and need to know)."
Qodrr,hrdp453,"At this time, all he knows that he needs to make contact with someone with royal blood. He knows it happened with Dina Fritz and Historia. And he also knows that Zeke is the only one left with royal blood."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,palipoor,What was that light thing happening when Eren shook hand with Reiner?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bokchoyk,So is Reiner dead? There's blood in Eren's hand as titan mode in that shot before he consumes Willy. Also I'm guessing. Falco got crushed?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,masterstealth11,Anyone else feel bad for Reiner? And all those Eldians that just died?
masterstealth11,LlamaLegacy,Yep. Notice how eren is aware that there are many innocent people above him and chooses to transform and kill them anyway. Really gives you a picture of how his character has developed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Hydro_Cannon,Eren‚Äôs transformation was his most epic to date!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jakefiz,Willy literally summoned the devil. Bet Reiner wishes he pulled that trigger

The-lamest-of-lips,LlamaLegacy,"good catch, it seems like a call back to s3, when they were talking to keith shadis. Both Eren and his mom have stated multiple times that he fights because he was ""born into this world"", so maybe it reminded him"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MudkipPlayz9,So is eren the attack titan or founding titan? I'm an anime only guy so please don't spoil I just got confused by it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Angel_1_Avenger,"Yo real talk, who was that soldier that guided pieck and poco to the hole?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Megajoshuaw,is willy an eldian? and if so why is nobody hella racist to him

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,spoongrill,"There seems to be a common thread of child grooming lol. First it was Eren‚Äôs grandpa shoving the crimes of eldians down Dr. Jaegers throat, causing him to become a patriot. Then Dr. Jaeger does the same thing to Zeke, causing Zeke to betray him and become a warrior. I think we‚Äôre watching the same thing happen to Falco with Eren grooming him and Falco will not understand. Especially when they showed the seen with Eren talking to his grandfather."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,camerose,Soooo even though Willy said he was coming forward with the ‚Äútruth‚Äù he‚Äôs still very much lying saying that the Eldians sins are so great and twisting it so that everyone is against Eren
camerose,Efilain,"I mean, of course he his siccing them against Eren but where is the lie about Eldian sins. Yes I agree that current generation of Eldians didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, but the original Eldian Empire did massacre nations with titan powers so they could subdue them. 

So while yeah, the contemporary opression of Eldians is cruel as they physically didn‚Äôt do anything, there is that eternal question whether people should pay crimes of their ancestors. (The question exists no matter what you think is the answer)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oooshyguy,Okay one the browns just won so I was preoccupied but holy cow this episode was so intense yet again! Oh my goodness.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,james2164,So can Eren actually control a million collasaul titans?
james2164,Ahmed_Umar,"Only with royal blood, like how he did with dina in season 2."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,james2164,So can Eren actually control a million collosull titans?
james2164,Axiser,"He cant unless he is with someone who has royal blood, like when he touched the royal blood titan in season 2 and historia on season 3"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bootylicker69420,"TELL ME IF IM TRIPPIN BUT WAS THE MARLEYAN SOLDIER THAT LED PIECK AND POLCO TO THE TRAP ARMIN??? Pieck said he looked familiar, and she ‚Äúlikes his beard‚Äù which I think means he didn‚Äôt have a beard last time they saw each other. I also think they purposefully didn‚Äôt show the soldiers eyes because they would resemble that of a titan shifter, as he has the colossus now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,immaheadout3000,Peace was never an option.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Boo_Netti,What a stroker episode üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Slyric_,Is the guard Armin?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NewAdvantage1003,Who was flying in the air when Eren transformed at the end? Was that Willy or Reiner?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NewAdvantage1003,Was the person who put Galliard and Pieck in the hole Armin?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crash18867,"Great episode and as always leaves me wanting more

And I'm just saying, since there was no episode last week they could have at least given us two this week :/"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,multisofteis,"What a perfect episode! 

I thought about the Tybur family doing a propaganda play to further make it seem like the paradies island eldians are the enemies since there was a scene in the trailer with Willy bowing down on a stage and in early S4 someone saying to contact Willy for smth.

Eren and Rainer's exposition had me sitting there with goosebumps! It was an absolute hell of a rollercoaster ride to see how Rainer just breaks down in front of him. I'm wondering what happens to Rainer. Will he switch sides, as he wanted to kill himself already because his only friends, paradies eldians, were gone (at that moment in time) and the only friends he had are all dead or missing except for Zeke and the other shifters and his family. Or is he just going to die/be a pawn in Armin's plan for what happens after.

So the next episode will be about the fight with the Warhammer Titan and Eren but maybe the other scouts will finally reveal themselves, but what's Marley's answer going to be as they kinda seemed like they knew at least something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ghostknox,But all I'm saying is that we got blue balled hella hard
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deathblade_1,"Bruh the moment Eren said ""I keep moving forward..... Until I destroy my enemies... "" Freaking goosebumps."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LikeMike04,Can a manga reader tell me which chapter we are on right now?
LikeMike04,Ahmed_Umar,"Ch 100, don't read the manga yet, wait until this season is over at least."
Ahmed_Umar,LikeMike04,Yeah I'm not planning on reading it until I'm all caught up with the anime. I just asked so I could know how far the anime is from being caught up
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Levi_0071,"Just watched the episode, didn't expect armin to see in this episode, the series going just... So good!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DhruvMP,the opening theme got me hype for the first time
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zuzuandaziggies,"I get that King Fritz took as many of his people away and wiped their memories with his powers to keep them isolated and safe from the rest of the world.
Titans constantly being sent over to Paradis Island may have even been a form of punishment he accepted as a consequence of all the violence and destruction his people visited on entire nations. I also get that Historia is not her ancestor, and wants to escape the tiny world her people were confined to after finding out they were living in exile from a more advanced world. It is unfair that the exiled Eldians are not given a chance to prove that they just want to live in peace like everyone else. Yet the sins of the father hangs all too heavily over them..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,visual_overflow,"On one hand, damn cliffhangers. On the other hand HELL YES LETS GOOOO"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sx-gabe,MY MAN EREN COLLLDDDDDDDD
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Last_Assist_125,"tybur be like i dont want to die now
aren: hehe"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I-am-Wyatt,"EREN FXCKIN JAEGER

Also poor falco..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stipin3939,where can i watch the hd version
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dyxteria,out of all the times an anime has blue balled me i have never felt the same way as this ending I literally started smacking my desk because i had all this excitement in me that had nowhere to go. god damn i love attack on titan so much holy shit
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rj_Rajat,"Finally some action, op episode and last when eren turns that things is good."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pick1ers,That was the greatest episode of tv ever. A 2 season build up to the most suspenseful dramatic moment goddam ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arad156,"So the soldier trapping Pieck and Porco is definitely Armin, right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NiamhHA,"Oh, how the tables have turned."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedditIsPropaganda84,"I am confused about something. So the original King who built the walls was named Fritz. And then in the present time the ""puppet"" king of the walls is also named Fritz, but the true King and head of the Royal family is Rod Reiss. Why did the family name change from Fritz to Reiss?"
RedditIsPropaganda84,taskkill-IM,I think the Fritz family renounced the name after moving to the island and took the name Reiss. Pretty sure that's what they said in season 2 or 3.. incould be wrong though.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CommonTreeSquirrel,"I loved the whole thing. But what i am curious about now is what are they going to do with the story.

Did they just make eren the antagonist of the series?"
CommonTreeSquirrel,LlamaLegacy,"Remember that the perspective has switched. In S1, Reiner was the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù from the eldians perspective, but was ‚Äúsaving the world‚Äù in the eyes of Marley. Now, Eren is trying to save HIS world, even if that makes him the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù."
LlamaLegacy,CommonTreeSquirrel,Oh so perspective is completely switched?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaninenlove,Either Willy have the War Hammer and he is just choosing a very convenient time to transform or he heard about the truth from his family and is very dead
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hogmc1,Did eny one relise we saw armin in this epesode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pelayo1991,Where can I watch ep 5 if you don‚Äôt have crunchy role or funimation
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zenkikid,"I mean... if  Reiner, Annie, and Bertholt followed through with aborting the mission none of this would have happened..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mohoq1,I don't believe the tyburs.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,partiallypoopypants,"I didn‚Äôt see anyone else talk about this, but doesn‚Äôt the Asian lady in the beginning seem a lot like it could be Mikasa?"
partiallypoopypants,cheesyvoetjes,Well wasn't Mikasa half Ackerman/Eldian and half Asian? I believe that was mentioned in the episode where her parents are killed and she is adopted by Eren's family. She was supposedly the last of her kind but they didn't know the rest of the world still existed.
partiallypoopypants,Dimmadeezy,She's the one who had the wine spilled on her during the dinner. She's much too old to be Mikasa.
partiallypoopypants,WavesRKewl,Uh no. You are racist
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kooky_Membership1096,"Does anyone else suspect that the marleyan soldier who shoved Pieck and Marcel into the pit could be Armin? I feel like the episode foreshadowed that character to be important for paradis‚Äôs attack in not only that moment, but moments to come. Am I wrong? It‚Äôs really got me thinking."
Kooky_Membership1096,shaynedoan129,That seems to be the consensus here
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,afcc1313,That's the biggest blue balls I ever had
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ngobscure,Eren is gonna go down as one of my favorite protagonists of all time. Man is playin' NO games now!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AndySenpai2,Ughhhh this episode was soooo great!!!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cbfw86,"If the Beast Titan can turn Eldians into Titans at his signal, why doesn't he just do it to Mikasa and Levi etc?"
cbfw86,LlamaLegacy,"1) The Eldians need to consume his spinal fluid first

2) As stated in S3, Ackermans are byproducts of Titan science so they literally cannot turn into titans"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GroundbreakingSort32,Why do these episodes have to be so god damn short. I binged seasons one through three in like a week and these 15 minute episodes are just such a dick tease
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KirkLazarus95,"Does Eren think that Willy Tybur has the Warhammer titan power or is it more as a post war declaration statement that he throws Willy up in the air like he's going to eat him? It seemed odd that they would have that dialogue with Willy explaining that it's not obvious who has the power, but now I think it makes more sense why they'd point that out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,f4quan,Atleast Reiner is guilty. I always liked him. Wren is about to go crazy lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-mi_h_ir-,Why are marleyans so afraid of the collosal Titans. They have to cross an ocean to get to Marley right?
-mi_h_ir-,Phantombk201,We've seen titans coming out of the sea in outros of earlier seasons. I'm assuming titans don't need to breath as they don't need to have other vital functions. They're also 50 meters tall.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ginestra7,Is there a specific reason why Eren scratched his face like Zeke does? Or is it just because they are brothers?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WXDE3,so did willy die or not because i had a theory that he‚Äôs the hammer titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SamSparkSLD,I‚Äôm still kind of confused about Eren using geass on Mikasa
SamSparkSLD,Epic_Meow,what
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Richard_Kingwolf,So are we just gonna pretend Armin didn‚Äôt get a beard so thick Pieck be having flashbacks
Richard_Kingwolf,Dimmadeezy,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs Armin
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Altairlio,"i dont remember gigi being this aqua like during the manga but written dialogue is always up for interpretation. loved the episode, AOT is best when it high stakes plot moving drama."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jinay_vora,"Every titan under Marley was accounted for except Zeke? Jaw and Cart were in that pit. Armour was with Eren. But what about Beast? 

Did I miss something or is this a hole in (supposedly) Armin's plan?"
jinay_vora,shaynedoan129,"Armin told Zeke to head to the front gate, maybe there are other people meeting with him like jean, levi, mikasa, etc"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,logic-pee,Why do i feel like that tall willy‚Äôs guard is the war hammer titan ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dinosaurfondue,"Man this season has been insanely good so far but I'm definitely slightly confused on a couple of things. One being why the Tybalt family is so revered even though everyone knows they're Eldians and the other being why Willy is so gung ho on destroying Paradis. If they just left them alone it would be fine. If he actually wants war then it makes sense, but if not then it's kinda dumb for him to do all of that."
dinosaurfondue,LlamaLegacy,"They're highly revered since they allegedly helped the Marleyans overthrow the Eldian Empire and force them to retreat to Paradis Island (Although this episode showed that was false). For the other thing, it was shown in the play that Marley knows about Eren stealing the Founding Titan. They also know that Eren can unleashing the Wall Titans at any time and attack, so he wants to unite the entire world against Paradis (We'll see more about it in the next episode maybe)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deixell,Masterpiece. 9.9/10 on IMDB says a lot. Even the top comment there got max stars lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,freeciggies,So I‚Äôm assuming Eren was the prisoner brought back by the cart Titan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CheeseDaver,That scene at the end reminded me a lot of King Kong.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Teamofwinter,"I really don't understand why Reiner, bertold and annie didn't just ignore the mission and live in eldian's empire safely since them going back would be their death and replacement please someone explain. Everything would have been avoided and I am totally on erin's side, they were going to attack them anyways then fuck em up bro.

Edit: actually i am not sure who to side with now that i thought about it again. I mean Eldian was at fault from the very start and for 700 years have been fucking Marley until they exploited it and gave them what they deserve and now they try acting all innocent and a coward part of them escaped or ended the war like king fritz who was soo good and kind didn't do shit these 700 years and when they started losing he is like nah i aint about these wars. I change my mind I am siding with Marley empire however I don't agree with them colonize other Empire's like Slava but that's how the world works.

Another edit: why did Ymir make a deal with the devil in the first place i misunderstood and thought it was because marley was colonizing them if thats the cause then i would be on eldian's side though its unfair and sinful however its not their fault its ymir's fault. They just happened to get the power it's not like they agreed and i guess that would be a great sacrifice of her but not acceptable.

Another edit: let me get this stright eren's missions was suppost to be him colonizing marley avenging eldians that are enslaved by marley but eren considers eldian his hometown so he will take revenge on both marley and eldins because those enslaved eldians hate the eldian empire anyways and thought the eldian empire betrayed them therfor they marley attacks eldian empire using eldians they slave like reiner ,bertold and annie EVEN FUCKING THOUGH GRISHA'S PLAN IS TO FREE THE SLAVED ELDIANS BECAUSE HE WAS A SLAVED ELDIAN BUT EREN IS NOT FROM THE SLAVED ELDIANS AHHHHHHHHHHHHH i mean it's the fathers fault for not teaching him who is his real town 
Though i doubt that's grisha's plan i feel like grisha liked the eldian empire BRO I AM DONE and exhausting thinking about this"
Teamofwinter,Warliss,"Family back home would be killed probably....

Ymir, on the other hand had 0 reasons to go back, is what I don't get..."
Warliss,zachariusTM,Yeah their families probably would have been killed and Zeke and Pieck probably would have snuck into Paradis and killed them as well.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Olipoli1233,Guys i cant watch attack on titan on crunchroll idk why
Olipoli1233,shaynedoan129,"Maybe because you don't have premium? The 63 episodes before that are free, and this episode will be free in crunchyroll on Sunday"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,h0m1e_,So is this season is just a time lapse into the future? Cuz the last we saw eren in previous season he was still like 15
h0m1e_,Dimmadeezy,They‚Äôve specifically said multiple times that there‚Äôs a time skip. Lmfao...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Son_OfRedditor,"Hi! Anime only here, what happened to reiner when eren transformed right when willy declared war , I haven't read manga and I wanna know what happened after.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shan_uu,How did eren transform into titan without cutting himself?
Shan_uu,LlamaLegacy,"Look at when he‚Äôs talking to Reiner, he already had a cut across his hand, meaning he cut it before talking to them"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,julianefaj,Why did eren hold reiner‚Äôs hand before he transformed?
julianefaj,Raknel,"Reiner was on the floor, Eren helped him up"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nxckg04,"I was really hoping that Eren was about to forgive Reiner because he learned that they both come from two different places that were taught two completely different things. Eren and his side of the walls were seen as enemies and that‚Äôs what Reiner, Annie, etc were taught. It‚Äôs not like they had anything else to go off of. And like Eren said, they were kids, they didn‚Äôt even completely understand the situation and the havoc they really caused. I was also expecting them to start a fight though..really cannot wait to see how this will turn out"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,m00t4,Could anyone point me to a good video of a rundown explaining the whole story. I spent years watching this anime and Im just really confused about some of the plot. Killer ep though!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,m00t4,Could someone point me to a good video giving a rundown of the whole story. Ive been watching this a ime for years and Im confused on some of the story. Killer ep though!

I couldn't tell you their number, bcuz depending where you watch they divide FMAB on Seasons or Parts, but originally it's only one single season.

As to why I prefer them, there are no ending in animanga more satisfying and estimulating to me, with its many interpretations and metaphors"

2. Attack on Titan
3. Rick and Morty
4. Full Metall Alchemist: Brotherhood
5. Arcane

Invincible is quite a bit further down"
-Plaper-,Mr_Master_Mustard,Having ATLA and AOT next to each other is just fantastic. And FMAB nearby. All good shows
AdilKhan226,vfb_fanboi,Clone Wars the last 4 episodes were arguably better
AdilKhan226,Espressoonice4570,Attack Titan/ other side of the wall. 2 not 3 though tbf.
AdilKhan226,TheGreatOwl_,"Ozymandias, granite state and felina from Breaking Ba and Killer Queen's Bites the Dust arc from Jojo's part 4.

Also I'm pretty sure some part or parts from Code Geass, as I remember being in awe most of the show, and it has some of the highest rated episodes of all time, but I'm really in need of a rewatch so I couldn't say exactly..."
AdilKhan226,NuuuDaBeast,I‚Äôd only say tv show triologies rival this
AdilKhan226,tsarking69,"If you are into star wars, the clone wars season 7 last 3 episodes are the peak of animated cinema and star wars in general. Like it's the best hour of star wars content period."
tsarking69,BookishAdvil,3 most recent episodes from andor
AdilKhan226,Graceful_Light,"Hunter X HUNTER ep that had komugi and king playing gungi, ep *110,111,113*  ep 131, 134,135"
AdilKhan226,Mikeytown19,I like to think this 3 episode run is probably the best in any series (just my opinion). I started watching ATOT when it first aired in 2013 and waiting those 6 years for these episodes just gave it so much weight to what was happening at the time.
AdilKhan226,FinnReddit1204,Hero has gone down to a 9.7 today I think
AdilKhan226,RelevantBag2995,"Don't get your hopes up finding this in another show. 

Just finished AOT recently, and it's the best show I've ever seen without a doubt. I'm not sure we'll ever have anything like it again."
AdilKhan226,itsnicomars,Midnight sun is 1/10 they didnt revive my goat
AdilKhan226,AirSpecial,No

Here ya go"
AdilKhan226,Julian-Hoffer,Probably the climax of the 23rd TB
AdilKhan226,Glad-Concert8268,"Coalition Invasion Arc from Kingdom Season 3, 24 episodes of epicness"
AdilKhan226,show_NO_FEAR21,Mushoku Tensei S3 loading but yah those 3 episodes are masterclass
AdilKhan226,LiaSpecter,No
AdilKhan226,townsforever,"I guess this is a hot take but midnight sun is one of the worst episodes in the series. 

Not only is it totally predictable from the beginning who Levi is going to save, which makes all the drama around the choice tedious, but it is also objectively the wrong choice. 

The rest of the story would have been far more interesting with erwin still around and eren/Mikasa Grappling with the loss of armin and the resentment towards Levi."
AdilKhan226,INS4N3S0CK5,"Not a trilogy of episodes, but theyre rather related, and light Naruto spoilers if you care

The Itachi reveal, the Tobi reveal, and the Madara reveal are all insane. Largely because of how long we were hypothesizing about anything and everything.

Also fun fact, Madara's VA is also Theo McGrath or whatever's VA. I knew I had heard him before and his name in the credits looked familiar"
AdilKhan226,ToxicKaizer,NO
AdilKhan226,Beneficial-Initial56,"AoT fans spam high 10/10 ratings on each episode from several accounts , and then post it for public viewing. If anything, 90% of viewers don't rate it at all."
AdilKhan226,BlueDragonWave,Trash ahh time travel bs
AdilKhan226,Onni_J,"Imo quite a few, Hellsing 8, 9 and 10 for example"
AdilKhan226,ValhallaKombi,"Greater? No. There are some eps that are on par with this WITH full context within their respective shows :-

###NEW EPISODE SPOILERS BELOW

###MANGA READERS INSTEAD HELP PROTECTING ANIME ONLIES FROM SPOILERS BY REPORTING SPOILERS IN THIS THREAD!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,notarsalaanahsan,Take me back to the time Eren lifting a rock and sealing the wall and the titans outside was our biggest concern. This is bad for my health.
notarsalaanahsan,idontcaretv,"Season 1 Attack on Titan: Yes!! Eren is going to win, humanity will survive!  


Season 4 attack on titan: ***Pain***"
idontcaretv,Antique_Sentence70,"Season 1: yes, erens gonna save the world 

Season 4: oh no, erens gonna save the world"
notarsalaanahsan,Combat_Wombat23,Everyone‚Äôs playing 4D chess now. Dont get me wrong I love it but there‚Äôs a certain feeling of nostalgia when Titans were the biggest threat.
Combat_Wombat23,Prelude_92,Eren/Pieck convo trying to figure out why Zeke was special!
Combat_Wombat23,awanderingsinay,"It was simpler and there was whatever lay on the other side of the Titans that offered so much so much mystery. There could be a cure or something for all we knew, the reality is so much more realistic and painful that I‚Äôm loving this season."
notarsalaanahsan,Chungulungus,Ahh when times were simpler
Chungulungus,themightyjimmmy,And no debates over studios
notarsalaanahsan,ayeitsnerdykate,I‚Äôm so stressed out and literally yelled ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù at my tv like 5 times during that episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,the only good thing yelena did good was killing that bastard who was insulting sasha infront of her parents. may he root in hell!!
loveholic_99,Prof_Black,"Sasha really did a number on Niccolo.

Dude used to talk about her everynight."
Prof_Black,Elbeautz,You remember how crazy she went for meat?? üòè
Prof_Black,JL_Klap,eldian pussy got a brother betraying the homeland üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
Prof_Black,fazepatrickstar,Niccolo is down bad on that marvin's room vibe all cause this girl fucked with his lobster.
loveholic_99,Barjuden,"That lady is crazy as fuck but she also has class. She's like a toned down Hannibal Lector, which is to say she creeps me the fuck out."
loveholic_99,kidgorgeous62,Yesss when he was ranting I was like fuck all y'all eat my ass you suck then he got popped and I went back to okay yelena I don't love you but don't hate you
kidgorgeous62,Charmingly_Conniving,Thats 10/10 ranting right there yo
loveholic_99,Redditer51,"Man, Sasha's parents have been through enough already."
loveholic_99,Nightmancer2036,YES
loveholic_99,_Conquer_within,i fell in love with her that moment
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Soccerfreakgod,"That final shot with Eren facing off vs the military is hype over 9000 levels. Also ashes on fire playing makes it perfect.

""COME"""
Soccerfreakgod,Combat_Wombat23,"His transformation was hardcore. And that roar he lets out after having been so quiet in Titan form all season, he‚Äôs pissed that they‚Äôre challenging him."
Combat_Wombat23,LeBronda_Rousey,Dude must be itching to try out his new warhammer powers.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,typicalasiannerd,"god that end scene with titan eren staring at the blimps of marley was badass, i can't wait to see reiner and him fight again."
typicalasiannerd,doctormcdonald,Crazy that this time I‚Äôm kinda rooting for reiner
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BizzNeuf,Well that was a fun 5 minute episode
BizzNeuf,PickleAmiiiiin,"Seriously though, why the fuck does a 23 minute episode seem like a 5 minute YouTube video?"
PickleAmiiiiin,r99nate,Time flies when your blood pressure rises above 200
PickleAmiiiiin,ChristianLW3,Time flies when you're having fun
BizzNeuf,CruzAderjc,"At least a lot of things happen within an AoT episode. I remember watching Dragon Ball Z when I was a kid. I‚Äôd anxiously wait till Sunday morning for the new episode, and it would just be like 14 total minutes Goku and Frieza staring at each other warning each other they were gonna fight and that the planet was gonna blow up in 5 minutes. And then that was it. And the planet wouldn‚Äôt even blow up until like 10 episodes later."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,unqualifiedromantic,"I liked how, when Piek was walking up the stairs and it cut to a shot of the soldiers looking on, we could see Galliard in the crowd waiting for the moment to transform and try to grab Eren. Nice detail."
unqualifiedromantic,YeyVerily96,"Ahhh I just went back to that part, you're right! I didn't even notice"
YeyVerily96,botbuabm,"How could you guys not notice? To make it even more obvious, he was literally the only character moving in that frame"
unqualifiedromantic,Purple-Lamprey,It‚Äôs actually very difficult to miss galliard in that shot. They specifically put him in the exact spot of the frame where piek was in the previous shot. Your eyes are literally staring right at his face automatically.
Purple-Lamprey,riotlancer,"It's been so long I completely forgot what they had looked like

If they put reiner there it would have blown my mind"
unqualifiedromantic,depressedmcflurry,youre right! i was too busy looking at the big nose bertholdt guy thinking about how he reminds me of someone from tangled
unqualifiedromantic,santiagof2p,I saw him and forgot which blond small person he was lol
unqualifiedromantic,aheze,"Rewatching now, thanks for pointing it out!"
unqualifiedromantic,Callitka,I saw him while watching the first time and my brain was like durr who‚Äôs that guy we recognize
unqualifiedromantic,akarenr16,I went back and now I see him. All the other dudes blushing and he‚Äôs making a face
unqualifiedromantic,joseph31091,"I noticed it too. Sadly, i would like her to join Erin's side."
unqualifiedromantic,AbaramaGolding,Piek also raised her hands to say Hello to show Galliard that Gabi was cuffed to her
unqualifiedromantic,terdfurgunson,Dang what an eye. Just rewatched....it changes everything seeing that. If I'd caught it the first time I'd have zero confusion
unqualifiedromantic,johncopter,This was so blatantly obvious. I'm amazed people didn't catch this.
unqualifiedromantic,Prelude_92,Going back to that!
unqualifiedromantic,postcardmap45,And he was the only one facing the other way! That‚Äôs always how you can tell lol
unqualifiedromantic,melonsquared,I saw him in the crowd and immediately knew what was up
unqualifiedromantic,underfluous,Omg going back to rewatch that part right now to see what I missed
unqualifiedromantic,Squish_94,"Yeah, I was falling for Piecks whole ""I'm on your side"" story until I saw Porco in the crowd."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,"well, it's been fun reading these comments every week. imma miss it. see you next year, guys. :')"
amazingaida26,3-DMan,See you space cowboy..
amazingaida26,netherregions20,"this hurt, I used to always come her right after every episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lightbringer34,"Just wanted to say, good luck to everyone who wants to stick  to being anime-only! I know it's  been super tough with people spoiling left, right, and center.  Wishing you the best!"
Lightbringer34,SunnySolaire11,"I regret watching Attack on Titan episode review channels on YouTube, because they don‚Äôt give 2 shit about what their thumbnails spoil when they discuss manga stuff. I hate my recommendations page now"
SunnySolaire11,fist_my_muff2,"I know the exact channel you're talking about. I blocked them.

Edit: The channel I'm talking about is Anime Foxen. His vids are good but he does Manga explanations and his thumbnails give shit away. So I just hit ""don't recommend videos""."
SunnySolaire11,AMK2201,What channel is it? I'm up to date with the manga but I wanna see what you mean.
Lightbringer34,True-Tennis,I was on a discord chat about crypto the other day and some asshole dropped a spoiler from the last chapter of the manga for no reason other than to be a dick. And it was a huge fucking spoiler. If I ever find that person I‚Äôm going straight Levi on them
True-Tennis,Brewers567,"If it‚Äôs the spoiler I think you‚Äôre talking about, how it‚Äôs led up to is still insane. I was spoiled chapter 138 and I was really upset but when I got to that point in the manga I was still blown away!"
Lightbringer34,BabyBoiTHOThrasher69,Is it bad that I feel like I‚Äôve been able to avoid spoilers well with only one character death and one plot point spoiled?
Lightbringer34,CharileDontSurf,All I can do is move forward and continue being an anime watcher... I feel like Eren right now I know certain things will play out wether I want to or not but not how it happens it hurts a different type of way when they do. But I‚Äôll never be disappointed been that way since 2013 when I first found out about Reiner and Bertholdt but the episode did more than satisfy and made my heart drop!
CharileDontSurf,Lightbringer34,The journey is half the fun! No worries! üëç
Lightbringer34,stillsebs,"Yep. I'm not touching this sub again. It was already plagued with spoilers and now everyone's going to read the manga (not me, I'm patient). 

Have fun everyone!

Also I don't understand how you can watch a show for years and years and then just spoil yourself with the manga because you can't wait half a year... but each to their own. 

Peace"
Lightbringer34,MyTVAlt,"Sorry brothers, I cant wait, I'm going to read ahead, but I want you to know I'm going to be one of those manga readers who reads the episode threads out of interest, nostalgia, and to report spoilers before an anime only sees them. Fuck people who spoil. Someone already spoiled something from further on for me. I don't want that to happen to anyone else."
Lightbringer34,yrm159,So far I am proud to say I'm completely spoiler free!
Lightbringer34,PMYourTitsOrPussyPlz,"I will never yield and read the manga, and my friend hates me for it because he's read the manga and wants to talk/discuss about the stuff that's happened with me but i just don't want to read it"
PMYourTitsOrPussyPlz,Lightbringer34,Courage friend! The wait will make the new episodes all the sweeter.
Lightbringer34,fist_my_muff2,It's easy if you don't use social media!
Lightbringer34,Beta_Whisperer,"Screw this, I'm reading the manga."
Lightbringer34,OneMintyMoose,Yeah ive been spoiled by the instagram explore page lol.  I know a few things that are coming
Lightbringer34,AtlasWrites,"This episode broke me and now I have to read the manga.  


I lasted for 7 years but this season finale... fuck"
Lightbringer34,Detective_Vendetta,I gave up after last episode I've got three chapter left
Lightbringer34,Slavicinferno,I was too weak and read all the manga in one day lol
Slavicinferno,Lightbringer34,"That‚Äôs okay, the important question is: Did you enjoy it?"
Lightbringer34,TheOneShade,Is the manga finished then?
TheOneShade,Lightbringer34,"There‚Äôs one chapter left, and it‚Äôs coming out on the 8th or 9th of April. I expect leaks before then, but it‚Äôs going to be crazy."
Lightbringer34,LordDeejus,"Good luck! And remember; even if you are spoiled, if spoilers ruin a story, it was never a good story."
Lightbringer34,A_Stupid_Face,"I couldn‚Äôt :(, good luck to y‚Äôall, hope you‚Äôll be ok dodging all the spoilers!"
Lightbringer34,tuniltwat,Just finished the anime today. What chapter of the manga should I read to continue where the anime left off.
tuniltwat,Lightbringer34,"Chapter 115-116 roughly. There‚Äôs a little extra context that starts in 115 you‚Äôll want to read, but otherwise, read on!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrHikigaya,"The way Yelena shoots Griez out of nowhere. Then comes Pieck with her Peak Brain show. I really thought she's changed sides but man oh man. 

Gabi sure is the most mentally troubled person right now and Falco physically because of her. 

I'll pretend that I'm surprised they ended the episode with something our show here is famous for.... a crazy cliffhanger!! 

I planned on reading the manga after this episode, but now I think I will hold it off. Ain't nothing better than experiencing all that hype and suspense for the first time with animated characters. Just gotta avoid spoilers. 

Reject social media. Become M O N K."
DrHikigaya,GoldenSpermShower,"> Gabi sure is the most mentally troubled person right now  
  
Gabi is doing a Reiner speedrun"
GoldenSpermShower,Pancake__Prince,She‚Äôs just continuing the Braun family tradition.
GoldenSpermShower,guzby1145,It runs in the family
GoldenSpermShower,Lightbringer34,"If you crouch and do half an A-press on the dead Paradis soldier, it slingshots you into the Eldian spawn zone for the Liberio map."
GoldenSpermShower,nariz1234,PTSD any% ''Eldian Record''
GoldenSpermShower,lolbabygirltop,REINER SPEEDRUN üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
DrHikigaya,matthieuC,"> Gabi sure is the most mentally troubled person right now

She has the shocked big eyes all the time."
matthieuC,downvotedbylife,Hasn't closed her mouth in like 4 episodes
DrHikigaya,werebearstare,I was planning the same! Any idea what chapter we would be on?
werebearstare,DrHikigaya,You wanna read from 115
DrHikigaya,1234NY,"I feel very stupid for not noticing it earlier, but Yelena really is a direct counterpart to Floch, only fanatically devoted to Zeke instead of Eren. Griez was a racist ass, but  Yelena's casual use of violence to shut him up certainly compares to Floch ordering the cadets to beat up Shadis in the last episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dmitriya,lol idk whos side to be on. Probably the team in the prison right now with armin and the others. It's basically Marley vs. Eren vs. armin+team.
dmitriya,xxphantomxx77,AoT really just became the best Battle Royale ever
xxphantomxx77,spectre15,"Reiner, where we droppin? Hot drop or nah?"
dmitriya,idontelikebirdse,"Out of principle, I cannot side with the genocidal Nazis or the delusional anti-natalists. I want a warless Armin victory, but I don't know how that could even occur. The ones preaching peach have ALWAYS ended out on the bottom. It's a depressing state of affairs."
idontelikebirdse,soulinfamous,"Because peace is a two-sided coin. For you to have peace, the other side has to want peace. If people hate and are afraid of you then I'm going to assume peace is never an option. To me, it's naive and ignorant of Armin to constantly want peace at the possible destruction of his people. Like the only solution I see is that the threat of world destruction by the hands of the rumbling but that seems like a negative thing to hold over the world."
idontelikebirdse,yourfbiman,Based
dmitriya,gensouj,Eren is prob team Armin
dmitriya,EltonJohnWick,"I wouldn't discount Eren from being part of the Armin+ team. The last thing the Owl told Grisha was to protect Armin and Mikasa. We've learned there's a lot of mirroring between Marley and Paradis. I wouldn't be surprised if what Pieck told Gabi isn't what Eren's thinking but hasn't said to Armin and Mikasa, basically that he doesn't trust the Paradis govt but he does the people he's fought alongside."
dmitriya,Fernernia,"My guess is that Eren is becoming the big-bad on purpose to make everyone hate him so Marley and Eldia can fight together and become allies or something, kinda >!Lelouch style!<

(Marked spoilers are to another show, but really big nonetheless)"
Fernernia,Luck2me2,I would hate that they did they. The show made fun of that logic with the Armin Pyxis scene in s1 I thomk
dmitriya,Ranjith_Unchained,Easy...whatever Levi decides
dmitriya,WorldlyCardiologist1,"Yeah me too.
Waiting lobby for Armin & the bois to drop the most Colossal track of the year."
dmitriya,pauds99,Lol because of that Armin and mikasa speech i am going to root fo wren. He will do something crazy
dmitriya,MyTVAlt,"I'm with Mikasa and Armin. They may end up back with Eren, they may not, but those are my people, I go where they go."
dmitriya,Awk4rd,"Listen to what i think. It's definetly Marley vs Eren but i wouldnt say Eren is against armin and camping.

I think what marley has done is wrong, they have used Eldians as weapons and judge them for their past. I dont know the truth about what Eldians have done. But i do know that in this time they are innocent.

To The point: Either way, all humans have suffered from titans in the past. Thats why they need to put a stop to all founding titans. Theres no way Eren would do something like keeping everyone from having children. It all seems kind off sketchy but Zeke needed to escape being eaten and Eren needed to lure Marley to paradis thats why they did all the things they had to do. 

By luring them to paradis, all the founding titans are all in one place, so Eren and Zeke are going to put an end to everything. They dont care who is in the right or wrong.

Eren is going to fight and eat all founding titans passed down for generations and sacrifice himself so noone can inheriate it again. So if im right the ending is going to be a ""sacrifice your life to become the hero of the world ending"". That also explains why Eren is trying to make Mikasa and Armin hate him, so he has no obstacles for his plan.

Let me hear your thoughts of this. This is just what i think, i may be completely wrong."
Awk4rd,Prince_of_Old,Don‚Äôt they say that if someone dies without being eaten the power passes to a random child
dmitriya,cCoyoteStarrk001,Idk bro I don‚Äôt really like the eren + zeke plan because that causes the eldian race to die out but what choice do they have? As technology gets better the titan way of fighting dies out. The only option would be for all eldians to get the remaining titan powers and use the rumbling to take over the war but eren doesn‚Äôt want to fight anymore
dmitriya,Nikulover,But what is armin+team's plan on all this titan and war problem? They don't seem to have any which is why I find it hard to support them.
dmitriya,WhizBangNeato,"I don't understand these comments.

It's genocide vs. genocide vs. maybe we can find a way to peace and if not we'll fight a war for our survival.  Pretty clear imo what side you should be on."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,myunfortunatelife,"i was really hoping that pieck had changed sides but i cant say i was surprised when we found out it was all an act. She was making some good points though when she was telling gabi why she betrayed them, i wish she truly believed that."
myunfortunatelife,JordanIII,"She does believe that to some extent though. At the end she says ""i don't believe in marley. I believe in my friends whom i fought alongside with"""
JordanIII,myunfortunatelife,true but she and all these friends she believes in are still fighting for marley rn. if she truly believed that there was no point in helping marley then what would even be the point of continuing this. idk i wouldve liked to see her and all the warriors stop helping marley but i feel like that might happen later on
JordanIII,dillydilly3500,It goes back to Pixis thing about good lies having some truth sprinkled in
JordanIII,Dovaldo83,"That seems to be the core of her character. The cart titan isn't anything special on it's own, yet with the proper comrades it really shines. She seems quite experienced with forming bonds with and supporting others."
myunfortunatelife,myunfortunatelife,Also i really want gabi to change sides so when pieck was talking to her i was hoping pieck was being fr and would convince gabi to join her. im glad falco already understands though
myunfortunatelife,Meidos4,"Change sides to help the people that destroyed their home just so Marley can murder their families? I know it would be fun to have all the cast be on the same team, but aot is a bit more grounded than that."
myunfortunatelife,le_snikelfritz,I was totally hoping she actually did switch sides cuz she wasn't wrong in her reasoning
myunfortunatelife,Prof_Black,"Pieck wants the Eldians free she just has a different approach to Eren and Paradise.

This entire season has been about freeing Eldians but the fights be about what steps to take."
myunfortunatelife,loveholic_99,i didn't want pieck to change sides because it's going to be less interesting for all the titan shifters to be on paradis side. things are better when the power is well balanced between both sides.
loveholic_99,myunfortunatelife,i personally wanna see the warriors come to the realization that theyve been brainwashed and that the paradis people are no different than them. I can see your point too though so i respect your opinion
myunfortunatelife,cCoyoteStarrk001,"The warriors are all honestly dumb as shit. Like when they get the founder titan powers back and then they wipe out paradis wtf do they thing the rest of the world is going to do to the last remaining eldians? Just let them live freely in the interment zone? The world just going to think ‚Äúfuck it let‚Äôs wipe the rest of them
out‚Äù and destroy the interment zone"
myunfortunatelife,beardstachioso,I still think it‚Äôs either bad writing or just super denial from the Titans on Marley side. The whole ‚Äú I trust the comrades I fought beside ‚Äú doesn‚Äôt convince me. They think it‚Äôs better for Eldians to have a shitty life in Marley and fighting for a power hungry nation that treats them worse than a dog??
beardstachioso,yanivbl,"A lot of soldiers join the military for ideological causes but this fades really quickly for most. When you ask real soldiers what's motivates them to keep on going, the most common answer would be the other soldiers around them. So, I don't think it's bad writing and her reasoning is very grounded on real psychology."
beardstachioso,Meidos4,"By fighting for Paradis they would be supporting one of two plans.

1. Castration. Ending their race.
2. Rumbling. Killing all their families and everyone they've ever known.

I don't get how so many people look at it just from one angle. Most of them are fighting for a similar cause, but are coming from such different circumstanses that there really isn't room for ""switching sides""."
myunfortunatelife,HotDog-WaterDrip,‚ÄúDo you how to tell a good lie? You‚Äôve got to mix some truth in there‚Äù
myunfortunatelife,BOYGENIUS538,Pieck and the rest of the warriors are uncle toms
myunfortunatelife,Fernernia,It was interesting to see Gabi want to side with her more as a traitor and be surprised.. maybe the lass is changing after all
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,i_am_da_1_who_knocks,Wtf happened to Zeke. Holy shit this episode was good
i_am_da_1_who_knocks,verticaluzi,He got put in that Titan hyperbolic time chamber
verticaluzi,GoldenSpermShower,Reverse birth
verticaluzi,Disabled_Robot,"Any calls on who the Titan was?

Could be one of levy's unit? the officers?"
i_am_da_1_who_knocks,Somethingblueee,I don't know what exactly happened to him but I for sure learned that kangaroo titans exist lol
i_am_da_1_who_knocks,fargling,When eren got eaten in S1 he transformed inside the stomach while seriously injured. Maybe it heals?
i_am_da_1_who_knocks,Kawala_,"The inside of that titan is warm, he won't freeze to death before he has a chance to heal. You ever hear of people cutting open animals to survive the night in the wilderness?"
Kawala_,cp710,Look at Han Solo over here.
i_am_da_1_who_knocks,zyadyasser,Zeke's chest cavity is probably now in some blood flesh smoothie form
i_am_da_1_who_knocks,scw55,"I thought Levi transformed himself in the event Zeke tries to kill himself. Transforming via injection heals you but you are a mindless Titan. But then you eat a shifter. Zeke got eaten in a direct way.

I expect this is wrong and I'll be disappointed."
scw55,Landyra,"I just watched the entire fourth season yesterday, so here‚Äòs my take: I noticed Levi didn‚Äôt actually kill one of the Titans that escorted Zeke out of the forest. The severed head still moved before the scene cut away. I‚Äòd guess this titan has fully regenerated in the time Levi kept zeke on the carriage and was commanded by Zeke to come get him? I first thought it was simply acting at own instinct, but the fact that it didn‚Äôt outright eat him seems unnatural - remember eren didn‚Äôt count as ‚Äûeaten‚Äú either when he was swallowed whole in the first season"
i_am_da_1_who_knocks,YamFor,Djekuh

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kri5hie,Are we not gonna pay attention to the fact that Eren needs to redo his iconic hair every time he gets out of a titan cuz it gets messed up when he‚Äôs inside? That‚Äôs some true dedication

Gm1504,SuperScrodum,"I pondered it but I‚Äôm going to toughen it out and wait. It‚Äôs just a year apparently, winter 2022. There‚Äôs also something about waiting for and anticipating every episode each week that makes it that much better.

Gm1504,Tnt540,"I caved and started reading the manga a few weeks ago, and I‚Äôm still SUPER hyped for the anime episodes. I think it‚Äôs worth it"
Gm1504,redditistheworstapp,DONT READ THE MANGA. if I could go back I would never have read it. The anime does things so perfectly and has so much more life. I personally cannot read in my head and give life to the lines the voice actors and scenes and music can do with the anime.
Gm1504,Barjuden,I'm gonna wait. It'll be a better experience so long as we don't get spoiled beforehand. Then you can just read the manga from the start afterwards if you want.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,treatemwithkindness,"Did anyone else feel that the ending was way too abrupt. Like, all the other season ends weren't so abrupt. I feel that the show creators wanted another season and couldn't find a good point to cut and were like 'fuck it, let's give these bastards the biggest cliffhangers and let them suffer for another year.'"
treatemwithkindness,cybersidpunk,yes because this season wasnt made to be divided like this but they had to do it because of the time constraints.
treatemwithkindness,nariz1234,"Yeah none of the other seasons (or half seasons) end in such a cliffhanger, but I guess cutting it any other place before would have been little satisfying, and it would be worse cutting it in the middle of the war."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirUlrichVonLichten,"- God damn, I really thought Pieck had switch sides.

- Armin's reaction to the Euthanization plan....was strange. I thought there would be more pushback on the plan. I mean the plan is really fucked up. They want to wipe out an entire race. And I know they are doing it because they believe it's the only way to stop the Eldian Suffering, but still. Will be interesting to see what the other characters think. Jean was the only one that showed any kind of push back to the idea. 


- I still don't believe that Eren is all in on Zeke's plan. I like that Jean even brought up the idea that Eren was faking all that shit. I'm gonna hold on to this. I got to! No way after everything our boy Eren hates Mikasa and Armin. No way he's really on Zeke's side. I gotta believe he wants to fuck Zeke over. I also like the idea that Armin was pretending to be emotional over the plan. 


- What. A. Cliffhanger.


- Thank god we are getting a part 2 and not a movie.


- It's going to be so hard to stay anime-only, but I got to do it. I've made it this far. Reading the manga now would feel like a betrayal. But mannnnn, I really want to.


- Overall, this season fucking incredible and cemented Attack on Titan as one of my favorite works of fiction. The wait for Part 2 is going to be brutal."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Elbeautz,Pieck pointing at eren was one of the most intense scenes of the series... even though it only lasted 5 seconds. This entire season has given me major trust issues. And this immediately became one of my favorite transformations of the series
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,curtismannheim,"So here are my speculationis about the future, based on some of the things from this episode and the past events.

&#x200B;

I don't buy that Eren will go along with Zeke's plan, and here are my arguments:

1. Making it so no more Eldians can be born is to give up. Eren does not give up, especially not on the freedom he's been fighting for his whole life.  Just remember season 1, when Armin is trying to get Eren to close the breach in Trost:

Armin: ""Why do we fight? What is the reason that makes us go outside the walls?""

Eren: ""Because this world is our birthright""

Sterilizing the entire nation, in Eren's eyes, would be do deny that birthright, the same thing the titans that he hated his whole life were doing. The same thing the royal family did by erasing Eldians' memories - denied the people's freedom to choose for themselves. Eren always fights for freedom, and urges everyone else to do the same. I don't think I need to remind you how many times he said the word ""fight"" for the  entirety of the show. 

2. In this episode Jean points out that Eren wouldn't hurt Mikasa without a reason (that scene was painful to watch btw). When Mikasa and Armin hear this they have a ""hey, waitaminit, he's got a point, maybe he's onto something"" kinda face. And, of course, before we get any of the characters' thoughts or speculations on this, they get interrupted. 

That is further proof, but from the meta point of view. I think most people know that this is how anime leave the breadcrumbs for us to follow. The same thing happened in season 2 when Reiner caught that Ymir can read Marleyan writings. That scene too, spanned just a couple of seconds, and got immediately interrupted by the titan attack. I believe the same is happening in this episode.

3. At the end of season 3 Eren asks if they would be free if all their enemies on the other side are killed. He says the same in his conversation with Reiner - ""I'll just keep moving forward, untill I've killed my enemies"". And in the previous episode again, when he talks about how Berthold is taking over Armin's mind, he says: ""An enemy within you that is in love with another enemy"". He still referred to Berthold and Annie as enemies. I think you can connect the dots.

In conclusion, based on our knowledge of who Eren is, going with Zeke's plan is completely out of character for him. Whatever his plan is, I don't believe he will do this. But then again, we didn't get Eren's own perspective on all of this in this season practically at all. All we have is other people's accounts and opinions on what he's got in his head. So there is still a possibility that he's changed. HOWEVER, such change would need to be justified hard, and I mean HARD. Literally, I think the only way he'd do this if he got some cosmic vision through his future seeing powers that there is no other way, because that's the only way you get someone as stubborn and driven as eren to break, and eve that is a stretch. 

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
curtismannheim,DapperDaveW,"It looks like all your evidence for Eren's motivations come from pre-Basement.  But according to Eren (in his conversation with Zeke) after he found the basement, a whole bunch of memories opened up to him that fundamentally changed him.  

And it is true that we saw some scenes with Eren in jail after finding the basement where he talks about seeing his father's memories and stuff.  Like you said, something like a cosmic vision.

We have almost no information on what Eren's personality after the basement.  I think all we have is him at the ocean where he does talk about enemies on the other side of the ocean.

(BTW I do think that Eren is playing Zeke and hasn't changed, but I still want to point out the thing I think you missed here)"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadZeus007,Is it a longer episode than normal? Judging by the trailer there still needs to be a fight but if it happens now i feel like it's hella rushed? Cuz eren wasn't even at shiganshina last episode.
DeadZeus007,verticaluzi,Bro just watch it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,spiralnotebook,can someone explain to me how the Jaegerist's ideals coincide with Zeke's plan of Euthanasia? i am so lost. Eren was pretty badass though.
spiralnotebook,mottoii,"The Jaegerists don‚Äôt know what Zeke and Eren‚Äôs plans are, they just support them because the alternative is doing nothing trying to come up with a plan while the whole world launches an attack on Paradis"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"I don‚Äôt care how this story ends, Sasha‚Äôs precious dad must be protected at all costs."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justaverage00,fuck me we haven't had a real titan battle in 12 episodes and now I gotta wait 12 months
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,usernames_ar3_hard,"I don't understand all the love for Zeke's character development. He's a brainwashed terrorist who has made it his life's work to murder and subdue other countries as Marley's weapon, while his long-term goal has been to euthanize an entire race of people. 

What about that is complex or interesting? He blames everything on Eldians, from Marley's actions to his own. His analysis of the world is about as simplistic and one-dimensional as can be."
usernames_ar3_hard,noonetellsmeanything,He seemed intelligent until his euthanization plan was revealed lol
usernames_ar3_hard,theamiabledude,I think Zeke's thing is that he's managed to get brainwashed by both ends of the aisle. He had his grandparents telling him stories about how awful all Eldians are and Grisha telling him that Eldians are perfect and he has to kill all Marleyans. I don't blame him for not having his head set straight lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ICantTyping,I cant find it on Crunchyroll
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ivorycat,"aaaaaAAAAAA

welp time to get fuckin hyped for winter"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wolfpac187,I miss when I knew who's side I was on.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,abbyylu,"is anyone else not super worried about our boy levi? they rlly showed what happened to zeke and not him, and now i gotta wait a year to find out if he‚Äôs dead or not..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DapperDaveW,"I want to clarify the four factions as I understand them and people can correct me where I might be wrong:

A) Zeke's Euthanasian Cult:  You know their goal - sterilize those Eldians so Titans die out.  This includes Zeke, Yelena, Onyankopon. Maybe Niccolo?  And if Armin's tears were sincere, it now could include Armin.  It also includes Eren... unless Eren is lying to Zeke.  Historia?

B) Eldian Empire Jaegerists: Liberate all Eldians and fight back against Marley and the rest of the world.  Activate the Rumbling! Kill all our enemies!  Floch and a bunch of nameless characters.  It also includes Eren... unless Eren is lying to the Jaegerists.

C) Paradis Military Old Guard:  We just want to defend Paradis and not start a World War. This is where most of our old characters are still found: Hange, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Pryxis. Is Armin still here?

D) Marleyian Warriors: Fighting for Marley against those island devils.  Take the Founding Titan for the glory of Marley and their cool natural resources too.  Commander Maggath.  Galliard, Probably still Reiner. I'm putting Pieck in here even though she described her motives a little differently, but she's still fighting for Marley. That guy Yelena shot in the head.

What's funny is that in this episode Pieck tried to manipulate Eren by pretending to be sympathetic to Faction B. But Eren may himself be lying about being on Faction B."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_Conquer_within,yelena can stare at me with those fanatic crazed eyes and i‚Äôd thank her ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xCeePee,"I have since grown accustomed to not trusting anything any of the characters say because everyone is literally operating on a different set of ‚Äòfacts‚Äô and knowledge depending on what they were taught (kind of like the real world on a sense) but man, even when I‚Äôm suspecting someone isn‚Äôt speaking / acting truthfully, it hits so damn hard.

I have never seen anything like this done in any other anime from a story and visual representation combo. Not always purely the animation itself, but the detail and facial expression makes me feel like everything is so much more real. This season has made me feel like my brain is on fire during every episode and the only shame is having to wait until the second half starts. Wow."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GutsyEddy,"Pieck is too sharp! She‚Äôs very intelligent and versatile. She attempted to gain the upper hand on Eren but once Eren had her figured out she quickly and convincingly acted as though she was on Eren‚Äôs side all along. I nearly felt for it too!

In that short time where she had Eren contemplating whether she‚Äôs on his side or not she tried to gather more intel on Zeke‚Äôs special abilities and Eren‚Äôs Founding Titan capabilities. Anyone gullible would have told her what‚Äôs up. Pieck is such a delight to watch and well done to Eren for being critical about the situation!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hemisby,i lol'ed when the soldiers were blushing when they saw pieck
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LegalLoliWitch,Galliard was soooo fucking close lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HotDog-WaterDrip,Bro I got scared for a second cause I thought Eren almost got eaten. That was a close one. The old Eren would‚Äôve been emotional. But this Eren just got ready to fight
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gigi_1803,Am I the only one who wants Reiner and Historia to meet?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twixxdaweedguru,Why is nobody talking about the Titan ripping it‚Äôs own stomach open and putting Zeke in it?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,drank_your_water,Feel like there are so many scenes from the trailer which we never got to see!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_the_Professor_42,"A few things from this episode I wanted to get your guy's opinions on. (NO SPOILERS OBVIOUSLY).

* I know that she was just acting now, but Pieck made incredible good points when talking about the future of Eldians in Marley. I wonder how she rationalizes the fact that the whole world is their enemy no matter what side they're on.
* Second, this is the first time we see Eren's titan with the Founding Titan, the Attack Titan, and the War Hammer Titan, I didn't see any huge differences I wonder if you guys saw any. 
* Armin seems to agree with Zeke a whole damn lot considering he cried after hearing their plan. 
   * Also, they think the plan has begun and the Rumbling has started.
* Finally, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT INTRO! I guess being a titan of Royal blood has its many, many perks. 
   * No updates on Levi, sad."
_the_Professor_42,Twindo,"Think about this. What if Armin realized how the Euthanasia plan is something Eren would never follow due to it being the ultimate slap in the face for ‚Äúfreedom of choice‚Äù so he cried with joy because he realized that if Zeke and the Marley and think Eren is working with them in this plan, than Eren is tricking them for something else."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,civ_gandhi,"There is a lot of information still missing and Isamaya has done well keeping it hidden. 

Here's what we're still missing :

We don't know about Eren Kruger(the  Owl). Ksaver and Owl were colleagues and obviously they must've had some interaction. Owl must've been able to deduce what Ksaver was up to. 

Here's my theory : although Ksaver revealed his intentions only to Zeke, Owl probably knew about this too. Eren figured it out from Owl's memory, which helped him bond with Zeke. 

Next we don't know how much the memories affect the current shifter. Eren accused Armin of being affected by Bertholdt's memory. Eren himself must've been affected by the Owl. 

I'm assuming each Titan has had a certain philosophy, which is inherited by successive shifter. Since Titan's fought each other, we're probably seeing a replay of history."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,genethegene10,I wonder why Armin said he was moved when Yelena was explaining stuff? Was that acting?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,woolstarr,"Anyone wanna talk about the odds for this next showdown...  
I'm struggling to see genuine conflict, I believe Pieck & Jaw are no match for Eren (Even before he had the warhammer) and I also believe Reiner is no where near a match for Eren on a 1v1 anymore (also before he had WH Titan)...

Eren can transform 3 times with moderate stamina at the 3rd while getting surprise fucked by the War hammer, Cart and Jaw, so now he has WH and completely composed on home soil i could easily see him quickly dispatch Jaw, possibly cart (how would she even get out of the shackles that fast) and solely focus on Reiner and the army...

and that is all without even talking about Eren having the ability to take out the blimps with WH's range attacks AND Having Mikasa with an army of 3DM Soldiers AND Having Armin on back up AND Possibly having Levi turn up (please no spoilers)...

This leads me to the conclusion of concern, I feel like its almost 100% certain the show is going to pull something out of its ass to Balance the fight (My biggest fear is Levi being wounded \[so the shows most OP character can't end the season early\] and not turning up for any of these fights)

Any thoughts... Anyone?"
woolstarr,bluebell135,"I agree about eren beating cart and jaw, but I don‚Äôt think you are taking into account Marley‚Äôs plan, they surely have one, and I‚Äôm also sure they are considering eren having the warhammer. I don‚Äôt know what their plan is but it‚Äôs going to be enough to have a good fight."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oooshyguy,All I have to say is the way eren has been carrying himself is so dope. And my mans just lost his legs didn‚Äôt even scream just got more serious and transformed lmaooo
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JCarterPeanutFarmer,This season has been an unrelenting existential blitzkrieg on my soul. My nerves are frayed after every episode. Absolutely incredible.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,haariitthh,I NEED TO SEE EREN USE THE WAR HAMMER TITAN AND FUCK REINER THEN EAT THAT LITTLE MIDGET JAW TITAN
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,downvotedbylife,Couldn't even give us a preview man this is just sadistic
downvotedbylife,cybersidpunk,i was hoping for a season 3 part 1 type mid credit too...

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,__BabyGroot__,"Today I will be pulling a Eren Yeager and will be off to The Nation Of AotManga. I will try my best to protect y‚Äôall once I catch up with Manga. I‚Äôll forever cherish those moments when we experienced a new episode together. Goodbye for now Aot Anime watchers.
-BabyGroot"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pleiop,"What a great show. I still think eren probably has another plan in place, back when Zeke was talking to his mentor guy he stressed the importance of using someone he trusted because ultimately Zeke is just a key but eren will have to make the decision. I'm guessing eren will do a quick switchero. It's pretty obvious Falco is going to have a major roll in this too. 

I don't mind the cliffhanger and would gladly wait however many years. As long as the last episode doesn't air this show will not end üò≠"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rafikiknowsdeway1,"I'm still not sure why in the fuck Zeke and Eren wanted to attack that city in Marley. Was that all just so he could steal the war hammer titan? I mean if Zeke and Eren were together then, why didn't they just do the whole sterilization thing right then and there at the hospital in the internment zone? What are they waiting for?"
rafikiknowsdeway1,CloudMafia9,"Then the Eldians would be fucked no? Nothing stopping the Marley from attacking Paradis. And whatever Zeke wants, Eren cares for his friends. 

Also we are not even sure if this is what Eren wants or if it is all a plan for something bigger."
CloudMafia9,SufficientHeart,Isn‚Äôt the rumbling stopping Marley from attacking Paradis? I‚Äôm also confused as to what exactly zeke and eren are waiting for right now.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,1800LUNATIC,should I know why the random titan put Zeke in it's belly?
1800LUNATIC,camerose,Not yet.
camerose,1800LUNATIC,Thanks I was super curious
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NothinButRags,"I like how Eren doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge Puck or Pieck. He just looks at the ship, waiting for Reiner."
NothinButRags,Twindo,They‚Äôve got beef.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,40ozFreed,I thought the titan that was crawling to Zeke was going to be Levi.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"Everyone‚Äôs talking about Zekes plan this Marley‚Äôs plan that but not who that little girl is that Zeke sees? Seriously who is that? My best guess is it‚Äôs Historia as a child cuz it kinda looks like her and that he sees her because they‚Äôre connected with royal blood, but that begs the question what‚Äôs the point in including that scene?

Edit: so I was looking back at the season 4 trailer for something else and when they start changing scene really quickly theirs a shot of a young girl drowning, and having fingers pointed at her. That girl and the girl Zeke sees look pretty similar but I still have no clue who she is"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nikhil_Subba,I bet I am not the only one who's going to re-watch from ep 1.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mhallaback,Imagine your just chillin downstairs with your fellow jeagarists while Eren questions piek and the guy next to you starts sparking
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flappydicks,"Hopefully the theories of why Armin is crying are correct, that he knows that Eren would never go along with Euthanization plan and that he has something up his sleeve. I want to see Eren and Armin team up so badly."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,illumantimess,"Oh man so many thoughts as a non manga reader. There is going to be a overwhelming flurry of characters eaten alive, right? There‚Äôs no way this doesn‚Äôt end with Gabi, Falco and maybe even that girl who saw her mom turned into a titan turned into Titan Shifters. Also Pieck is an amazing character and really makes you question your own morality for sympathizing with her."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ReservoirBaws,"I like how Eren is surrounded by enemies. Peick and Galliard (who bit his legs off), non-jaegarist Eldians and a few blimps worth of Marley‚Äôs military and his response? ‚ÄúFuck you Reiner‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JanKwong705,I just love Pieck.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadZeus007,"I was super interested in the marley episodes at the start of the season. I thought they were amazing! But my interested dropped slowly but surely with each following episode after that... 

 All seasons, everytime the last episode dropped i was broken and couldn't wait for more. For some reason, this last episode didn't do it for me, i thought it was extremely bland and honestly non-nonsensical.

Pieck says she doesn't believe in Marley but she does Believe in her comrades... Well... 99% of the ppl in the blimps are Marlayens with the only exception beinger Reiner and Colt... So...

Pieck casually finding Eren and stabbing a guard... Eren actually believing Pieck could be on his side... eh i dno... This episode was weirdly paced for me and honestly kindoff a snoozefest."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HydraTower,ffs Crunchyroll
DrHikigaya,Elbeautz,Probably but i dont think it should be ruled out that that is his inner bertolt crying. Bertolt did have that come to jesus moment where he cried and said ‚Äúwho asks for this?!!!‚Äù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deliciouscorn,"I am so confused what Pieck‚Äôs reasoning was for pointing a gun at Eren and telling Gabi to do the same, only to reverse course 5 seconds later admitting there was no point to doing so lol"
deliciouscorn,woolstarr,fake drama... Still at least it gave us a pretty badass conversation as useless of a scene it was
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zyadyasser,Piek's plan was really bald. like there was no guaranty that eren wouldn't just go stand next to her while she was pointing out the intruders then kill her with his transformation when the jaw titan attack. Ofcourse she didn't know that they would chain Gabi to her insuring she can't transform without killing her
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DerbyKirby123,How many people noticed Porco in the middle of the soldiers when Pieck was saying ‚ÄúYorishko‚Äù to him and not the soldiers? She is smart and aware of her surroundings. I think they made it obvious by his reaction.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mita_amrita,What does the kanji say at the end of the episode? There were a couple as they showed tidbits of upcoming episode(s).
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Swedvin,"This is ok, I‚Äôve waited a year between seasons, I can do this again.


Fuck, I can‚Äôt do this again, this is not ok"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,I guarantee you Reiner was the first one in line for this mission. Dude is jumping on every opportunity to die.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ipaidgymfee,"LPT: Never watch a Youtube video on AOT until Winter 2022 if you are sticking to Anime, in case if you are watching just don't go to Comments sections, there are some sick bastards out there who just want to ruin people's joy."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lustman69,Guys didn't pieck say that zeke had the power to draw out the founding titans power? Was it the truth or was she bluffing?
Lustman69,Krishnacz,He has the royal blood and knows much more than other titan shifters which eren confirmed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Krishnacz,"I'm not sure when armin cried was it genuine or not, to me it felt like he was trying to gain yelena's trust even if its small"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zachariusTM,Okay I'm just realizing how was Levi planning to have a Titan eat Zeke?! He can control titans with his royal blood.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lawlaw125,Its really hard for me to follow the motivations of litterely anyone... Can someone explain why Piek is on Marleys side even tho she litterely told Eren minutes ago a very plausible explanation why they should follow Eren. Why Rainer cried in front of Eren but now wants to attack paradies again even tho he said to him that he hates himself for what he has done...
Lawlaw125,cybersidpunk,"marlay is a very authoritarian country. pieck and reiner love their families and if they are caught betraying the country, in the end their families will have to pay for it thus them siding with marlay."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ben_CartWrong,I'm still annoyed at that cliff hanger. It wasn't even a cliff hanger it was driving full speed at a cliff and then going just over the age and then pausing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dobmeista,I thought for sure at the start that the pure Titan was Levi and he was gonna eat zeke to become beasty boy! Then quickly remembered there was no way for Levi to become pure titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HotDog-WaterDrip,I‚Äôm gonna wait for part 2. The amount of dopamine I get from the anime is much stronger than the manga
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flipsideredkyo,anyone else sad for the lack of levi content ü•∫
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Karimattar,Why Hange is not imprisoned ?! and where was she going with the scouts ?
Karimattar,Raknel,"They briefly touched on this a few episodes ago. Hange was the one in charge of detaining Zeke, only she and a few others know his location. Floch and some Jeagerists are making her lead them to Zeke."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Velshtein,These last few episodes have had a level of intensity I never really felt in a lot of the other episodes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mdmd33,I have never been more stressed watching an episode of this show in my mafuckin life! Holy hell I honestly don‚Äôt know who is going to be the next traitor or who is playing who! **STRESS BRUH! STRESS**
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Complex-Ad-437,"Why would Pleck needs to go to the roof to expose her comrade? Why not just tell Eren where they are, or bring them there herself.

Also, how would the jaw Titan know where Eren is standing? How did the jaw Titan manage to infiltrate the army without going through training. Nobody asked why there's a stranger among them?"
Complex-Ad-437,Raknel,"> How did the jaw Titan manage to infiltrate the army without going through training. Nobody asked why there's a stranger among them?

People on Paradis don't have IDs like we do in the 21st century, they just need a uniform to sneak in. He couldn't have maintaned his cover long but he didn't have to.

Also there are ~10k people in the Garrison (the military branch Porco infiltrated) and the Jaegerists just overthrew the rest of the military so there's a lot of movement in Shiganshina. It's not like everyone knows everyone. Floch was also recruiting new people even from the trainees so all the more reason why new faces don't surprise anyone."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PandemicPartners,My prediction is the series ends with armin and mikasa with probably help from the rest of the og scouts having to team up to kill Uber titan eren to save the eldian people from Zeke extinction plan.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdeQ217,"Wow what a badass Eren has become, when he told Pieck that he knows she can't kill him it gave me chills ( I'm not an Yeagerist just pointing that out). I love how Jean didn't change one bit and instead of going into a rage reasonably points out the flaws of "" The no pp plan"". I'm also amazed by two things:
- Armins acting skills, I wonder what he was up to
-How smart the Titan who saved Zeke was , I knew Zeke's titans were extraordinary but wow, this also raises a question : Levi asked ""are you still in there?"" when fighting Valis which paired with Zeke's titans being really smart for pure titans (I mean that there's a chance that some kind of their humanity alongside intelligence remained in their titan form) might be a hint from Isayama that there's a different way to turn Beast Titan's titans back into humans. 
Also I NEED TO KNOW IS LEVI OK"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Taikaukko666,I just read some manga and i have to say it feels weird to see people speculating what could happen when you already know whats gonna happen

cybersidpunk,Twindo,Nah Zeke ripped apart that Titan and also this Titan doesn‚Äôt look like Levi at all lmao. I‚Äôm willing to bet that Levi is still alive. Besides he never drank the wine so how would he even transform into a Titan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cmtr2113,Anyone else notice that Eren kind of had the same transformation of the WarHammer Titan where he didn‚Äôt transform from the nape. His transformation looked like it originated form the middle of his body. He also didn‚Äôt need to bite his hand in order to transform.
Cmtr2113,Hange11037,"I mean he only needs to be bleeding to transform, and losing half your legs will do the trick pretty good"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stillsebs,"Gonna be straight up honest, the chapter was fire, but for a season finale, that was extremely weak. Compare every single season finale to this. This one looked like a regular good episode.

we *slams head on table*

long? *slams head on table*"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Harpzeecord,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a HUGE AOT fan (as evidenced by my A4 size Levi tattoo which you can see on my profile). But I think the end of this seasons especially has fallen into the trap of becoming too complicated for its own good. 

I know they're going for mind blowing plot twists but ""the brightest star is all the more glorious for it's brevity"" and at this point with all the betrayals and side switchings nothing shocks anymore so surprises lose their impact. 

I think they've also taken the whole ""everyone has their own cause, which they believe to be good"" and ""there are only losers in war"" narrative a little too far and are pushing it v hard with quite in your face examples. 

Don't get me wrong I've loved this season, I just think it's getting a bit muddied down and stalling (especially with the entire penultimate episode being Zeke back story). The first half was so intense you could barely breathe and now it's really slowed to a crawl, albeit the Levi Vs Zeke pt3. 

Also not knowing who to root for and by extension if the MC's motivations are true (does Eren support euthanasia, does he hate Mikasa etc) instills so much doubt to the point where any shock plot twists with MC motivations you just instinctively go ""probably a bluff, nah can't see that happening"". This combined with constant twists and turns makes it hard to get behind the plot and build momentum with it. 

Still loved the season just think it's definitely not as perfect as people say."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rayk10k,"Still on Eren‚Äôs side, man.

I also want to understand Pieck+Gabi+Falco+ And Reiner ( And maybe Annie???) I'm only watching anime but I'm assuming she'll be brought in later. I wanna understand them and I slightly root for all of them. Except for Marley, Magath and Co. I don't give a shit about them.

I did like the talk of Marley problems how they will never allow Eldians to be free which is what Eren is fighting for freedom for Eldians. However he‚Äôs making Paradis more like Marley by murdering people and arm bands. This episode explored issues with Paradis showing us that Paradis could be as shitty as Marley because while they are punishing those who are racist to Eldians what are they doing to those who are racist to Marley? It could just be Marley all over again but with reversed roles.

I‚Äôm hyped for episode 17 when that comes out but I wasn‚Äôt really satisfied with this episode mostly because I don‚Äôt like cliffhangers especially cliffhangers that end when all the action is about to go down. 

But whatever I love attack on titan and I can‚Äôt wait for part 2. See you guys in 2022."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,downtimeredditor,"I'm not going to spoil anything but if you wish to start reading the manga from where the anime left off it's around chapter 114. 

The final chapter of the series is in 12 days. That is all"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Griez really called the entire AOT fandom out when he insulted Niccolo for falling in love with Sasha.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gravexmind,This was the last episode until the winter???
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zeddyy101,"And WHO KNOWS WHAT ANNIE has to do with all this!
Can't stop thinking about how she plays a role some how."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,infantgambino,"Also if wanna start reading, do it from 115. They left out a lot this episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jack_of_Hearts20,AoT really feeding us content from a teardrop. Why is it gonna take so long for part 2 of S4? I feel like screaming
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CycleOfPain,"Mappa didn't do CGI titans this time and the attack titan and jaw titan look amazing. In any case, they did a good job incorporating cgi and anime together for the previous episodes.  Imagine if Mappa had more time. Can't wait for part 2 :)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H2opy245,Only thing I gotta say. WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOY LEVI
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uhhsamurai,When Eren transformed was so ducking badass
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Insane8ear,"Who was that at the end with reiner, was it colt?"
Insane8ear,Raknel,Yes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jebgaz,I don't understand how Galliard managed to transform without lightning raining down? Since when can Galliard do this? With Eren we clearly see lightning coming down.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ok-Ask-7718,Really ending at that particular scene and make us wait for 9 months.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ch00choh,I do hope the dub team finishes this anime strong.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jinay_vora,how many chapters have been adapted now?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kit_7,Obligatory reminder: Eren is the GOAT !
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Apexbravoo,"I swear everytime i watch a episode and see the ""To be continued"" Im like WHAT! it's only been 5 min! And then i curse silently. And this happends. every. single. time."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vishalbharti69,Will wait for the anime.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,real_pkb,Has Jean realized something about Eren? There has to be some saving grace for Eren right? I would be devastated if he were to become another Daenerys Targaryen.

Shit what am i gonna do now"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Changlini,"Don‚Äôt spoiler me, but: 
How in the world did Eren NOT get eaten from that surprise attack?! Does he have Spidi-Sense?!

Also: I liked the background bit where you could hear the family kids reacting to Yelena assassinating the Marley Brained former buddy of the guy he cooks for Sasha."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,secdeal,I think I got robbed. Why is it that the last episode of the so called Final Season is not the end of the story?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,A_Kid_Called_Xander,Still can‚Äôt believe Eren hates Mikasa and Armin. Felt like it was all for nothing :(((
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xxarchangelpwnxx,"So does the jaw titan now get his powers since he managed to eat his legs no right because he didn‚Äôt get any spinal? 

I‚Äôm confused how this whole thing works actually. I know that Erin is a titan, but is he the attack titan who has the founding titans powers? 

Also wouldn‚Äôt since Erin used the jaw Titans powers to eat the hammer titan shouldn‚Äôt the jaw titan power be passed to him as well or is it just one at a time can have it, and how come Erin got it and not Jaw? 

Any lore help would be awesome"
xxarchangelpwnxx,AlphaX4,"they need to ingest spinal fluid, not just blood."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thegoodmanhascome,"I see a lot of theories about how eren will escape this. I haven‚Äôt read the manga, and only started watching the show a few months ago, so my predictions are either totally off (95% chance) or mostly on the money (1%) and then partly right (4%). But hey, I‚Äôve gotten done weird predictions right before and so far. But there are a lot of details and nuances in this show which I‚Äôve not noticed/thought about. Any way, mild caution at the remote possibility that I‚Äôm right about any of this. 

 I don‚Äôt think this is a matter of escape. 

I think Eren‚Äôs plan is to eat each of the other titans, and I think that‚Äôs what we‚Äôll see here. I think he‚Äôs going to eat all of them, including Armin and Zeke, to bring together all of the Titans into one vessel again, like Ymir‚Äôs Titan. Like Thanos, it will have costed him everything. 

I think that in this battle in the beginning of part 2, I think that we are not only going to see Eren win, but succeed in getting three more titans added to his repertoire. Leaving only Annie, Zeke and Armin left. 

I also do not buy for a second that eren wants to euthanize everyone. He plans on starting this ‚Äúrumbling‚Äù thing, and killing everyone except eldians. He wants to redeem his father more than anything. Unless I‚Äôm totally wrong and he only wants justice for his mother. In which case, he will euthanize everyone. 

We know that if Eren touches Zeke, he would have the founding titan‚Äôs ability. What if eren ate him? If he got his powers that way, that would leave only Annie, and Armin standing in the way to protect her. They will most likely move Annie outside of the city, and Armin will feel safe to bring out his titan. Then Levi and Mikasa will probably swoop in and almost kill Eren. But fail. 

Now here‚Äôs the thing. Based on what I‚Äôve seen of this creator, there is going to be a concrete ending. And there is a grand purpose for why this story is being told now, and not later on. If Eren is defeated, then that leaves the possibility that someone else will do this in the future. If he does the Zeke euthanizing thing, I guess it ends, but it could still be reversed, by Historia or her baby. If he goes on a global genocide, that‚Äôs really the only way it‚Äôs all over. It‚Äôs a sad ending, but this is the anti hero that Eren has become. It would be an extremely controversial ending, and would absolutely spark HUGE interest in the show. I don‚Äôt know, just my thoughts.. then there‚Äôs the instant self destruct commands he could send to all eldians. So I don‚Äôt know. 

Either way, I think he‚Äôs going to have this dilemma, which I only see as a possibility if he has all 9 titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wingedlilith,"I kinda agree with the euthanasia plan,,, it‚Äôs nihilistic, genocidal and not the most rational but I can see why it‚Äôs the right thing to do,,, being turned into a titan is nothing less than utter torture for the eldians themselves and it‚Äôll save humanity from the titan threat forever."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bababoye_,So did Armin really started crying after Yelena said their massive plan? Was it really dat moving for him to start crying and not grieving it?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,whatsurplan2nite,Yo fuck eldian euthanization
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,romanNood1es,"I miss the green eyes, please bring them back."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zackywacky123321,"So was armin actually crying about how beautiful Yelenas speech was, or is he trying to hide his true feelings?  What do you guys think?"
zackywacky123321,bluebell135,I think he is acting. Why? I don‚Äôt know.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iwatchalotofporn6969,Why wasn‚Äôt there a transformaion light beam thing befroe Galliard popped from the ground?
iwatchalotofporn6969,Raknel,"The lightning from the sky is kind of an anime addition as far as I know, which creates this minor plothole of having no lightning when they transform underground."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tempstem5,"Wait, Armin's actually impressed by the Euthanasia plan? Am I the only one that thinks sterilizing a whole race of people is bonkers?"
tempstem5,DIMGOD,"Sure, maybe in this world. But imagine there was a race of people that could turn into towering monsters, that were also cannibals. You might reconsider"
tempstem5,insertproperusername,i wouldn't be too sure he actually feels that way about the euthanasia plan tbh it feels out of character
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the_wacky_introvert,I was rewatching the episode and noticed that Eren started ‚Äúthundering‚Äù before Peick pointed to Eren.. Did he already knew that Jaw was underneath?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justapotato9,"Omg.. when I see the anime is ending yet all the shits just happened at the end I was like nonononono please dont do this please DONT MAKE US WAIT and then they did :‚Äô)
 
Also, did armin just cry out of relief for figuring out eren‚Äôs real plan is? Considering how smart he is he must be right???

Now that we know zeke‚Äôs real plan I find it funny because it feels like the NTR plan for stray cats"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OmryR,"After learning about the biology change eren can do with zeke to all eldians, Is it possible for eren to use the founding Titan + zeke to change his biology to become a ‚Äúroyal blood‚Äù? Or just remove the need for royal blood to use the powers of the founding Titan?
I find it hard to believe eren wants to go with the euthanasia plan and I‚Äôm trying to think what his aim is?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dikshit101092,"How many chapters were covered in final season part ,1"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zaclarke,I got to stop using google to look up stuff because I just found out two major spoilers
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoorlyWordedName,So when is the next episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Normular_,"Know I‚Äôm a little late, but damn. I‚Äôve never truly related to or liked Eren but he turned into a full John Seed cult leader. I was hoping there would be some little hint about what he‚Äôs planning or how it ties together but ig I‚Äôll have to wait."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tyler980908,"Season 4 was amazing, was worried with a new studio and everything, but haven‚Äôt seen such a tense anime in a damn long time, can‚Äôt remember the last time I felt anxious waiting for an anime episode. Great work Mappa"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AsrielGoddard,So this is what *peak* best girl truly looks like.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdmirableElderberry9,I can‚Äôt believe they showed Hange‚Äôs team at the beginning and didn‚Äôt come back to her and Levi at all. What the actual fuck MAPPA.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainK14,As great as this season was is anyone else just angry at how they ended it? I'm sorry but how are they going to leave it just like that for the next 8 months or so?? Not even a little bit of closure. Maximum blue balls.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,beepb00pbeebop,"Maybe I‚Äôm in the minority here but was anyone else a little bit disappointed with this episode? I get that the last scene leaves us on a cliffhanger, but this episode was the end of the 1st half of this season, and it kind of felt like a transition episode almost. Just not as strong, keeping us on the edge of our seats like the finales in prior seasons. Maybe I‚Äôm just expecting too much. Either way, I‚Äôm excited for part 2 to come out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,idontcaretv,"Why is nobody talking about how Pieck said ""You shaved your beard?"" to Yelena, wtf. Is Yelena a man?"
idontcaretv,Leonhardt_309,She wore a fake beard when they interacted on Marley.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SenatorBC,"I am confused, Levi wasn't the titan who put Zeke in his stomach right?"
SenatorBC,loveholic_99,i think it was the female titan who got her head torn apart for zeke to use a weapon. she probably regenerated
SenatorBC,Tinseltopia,"As far as we know, Ackermans are not confirmed to be able to turn into Titans. But to answer your question, No. Levi was not the Titan"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarkSector93,Wtf s going on with Armin??? I can't believe he's crying.........
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MUSinfonian,"Is it me, or is Eren‚Äôs Titan subtly showing off the Warhammer aspect by the glazed-over white-colored irises in his eyes? They were usually that deep emerald green even in the attack on Marley in Liberio."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YamFor,"Very cool episode. Much enjoyed. 



Would be cool if Eren threw Armin at the ships and he transformed in the air"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SunnySolaire11,"I have no idea who‚Äôs side I‚Äôm on anymore. I don‚Äôt understand what Eren is doing anymore, I hate that he‚Äôs basically turned against all his friends. I feel more like a marleyan because I want Reiner to come in and wreck Eren‚Äôs shit. I know Eren probably has some sort of good intention, but he‚Äôs being a total POS right now in my opinion. I just want Armin and Mikasa and the gang to be let free of prison. That‚Äôs all"
SunnySolaire11,KK-Chocobo,"Marley breeds eldians in camps treats them like shit and brain wash their kids with propaganda to get them to fight for them as titan shifters. And they use eldians as bio weapons by injecting them with zekes spinal fluid and then dropping them into battlefields as seen in early episodes of the season.

I don't understand how anyone can side with marley tbh.

Especially when you count how many people died on paradis Island since episode 1, just because marley feels like their power is slipping and wants the founding titan.

About Eren, he's definitely playing some 4d chess here. We'll have to wait and see."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rodukas,"Now that the season is over, I finally watched the trailer and I'm so happy I did not before, as it's full spoiler territory.

However, either I already lost memory of what I watched over the past weeks, or it seems a lot of elements of the trailer were not present in the final product.

Anyone ?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoreMegadeth,"Not gonna lie, the first half of the season had an awesome build up and even better payoff. It seemed like the second half was going to do that too, it was looking to maybe even excede the first half imo, but that finale was super weak. A lot of it was a recap or repeat of information at least, which is unlike AoT. There wasnt a proper pay off for the second half and having us wait months for its conclusion is souring. Especially when a Part 2 was never confirmed, so psychologically I was expecting a lot more from a ‚Äúfinale.‚Äù What did happen was good, dont get me wrong there, but it was more build up which we already had a ton of. Just my 2 cents. 

Tldr A little bummed we didnt get more action in the back half and finale especially."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ChristianLW3,"First of all how is Zeke still alive? his body below his pectoral muscles is gone, he literally has no heart lungs and his remaining blood should have poured out

Also I believe if Zeke told Marley military about his sterilization plan they would have supported him, because the only reason why they're allowed to live is their military value, now thanks to Modern weaponry they're becoming obsolete

I wonder how many troops and weapons Marley was able to fit into those five blimps, if they don't quickly capture the founding titan they will be surrounded and destroyed by eldean reinforcements"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,"Ngl I feel like they did us dirty here. They ended it on a great moment that I really wanted to see, and most of the episode felt meh."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kayehnanator,"I don't get why it's called a Euthanization plan when that's killing people, it should be the sterilization plan. Also, turns out Zeke/Yelena hate Eldians more than even Marley does, which is why they want their bullshit sterilization plan.

I hope the manga is better."
Kayehnanator,Twindo,Euthanasia is the process of mercy killing someone to save them from suffering. Pretty fitting with the whole point of the plan. They basically wan to humanely and slowly put an entire race out of their misery.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,louijp,"does armin not have the same partial transformation ability as bertholt? he doesnt have to blow up the city that way, right? just curious about that"
louijp,_whensmahvel_,"I believe that partial transformation/the colossal titan in general had a big retcon. He didn‚Äôt always have the nuke button/transformation, not until season 3 and he seems to always do that every time he transforms now."
_whensmahvel_,Twindo,He also disappeared instantly the first time Eren fought him.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noduckshere94,I'm confused and sorry if this sounds dumb. There will be more episodes next year? Or just one more episode?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SufficientHeart,"So, am I dumb or am I just missing something? Why can‚Äôt Zeke and Eren just touch hands and go ‚ÄúOkay, all Eldians are infertile now‚Äù? What‚Äôs all this hullabaloo for? 

They keep saying that‚Äôs their plan but I feel like they haven‚Äôt told us what the heck they‚Äôre waiting for??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mind_Enigma,"Not sure why there's so much love for this episode. It was basically a filler with around 5 minutes of an actually good episode. Most of the dialog was of things everyone already knew, with a couple of interesting things thrown in."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_whensmahvel_,Question: I thought titan shifters weren‚Äôt able to transform after they‚Äôve been seriously injured?? Why was Eren able to transform after he got his legs bit off? Did the Author forget about that or? Lol
_whensmahvel_,Michyoungie,"Because the injury (his legs getting bitten) was the cause for the transformation and he was still in human form and just going into the first transformation, them only needing to regenerate first only matters when they've already transformed and exhausted. 

Which is why Zeke last ep wasn't able to quickly heal or transform right away, as he already went full Beast Titan plus hardening and controlling the Pure Titans and then getting blown

."
Michyoungie,_whensmahvel_,"Ahhhh okay I remember that now that clears things up, I forgot that it‚Äôs kind of a resource/energy thing and not just a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hurt so I can‚Äôt transform thing‚Äù"
_whensmahvel_,Twindo,Probably something to do with having three Titans in your body.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PotatooFace,"some answers here please...
how pieck's titan got transferred and she's still alive?
also why didn't zeke touch eren the first time they met ?!!
and why the heck did eren beat his friends ?"
PotatooFace,23rd_altacc,"What do you mean pieck‚Äôs titan got transferred? She‚Äôs still the cart titan. If you‚Äôre talking about the one that came out of the ground, that‚Äôs the Jaw titan.

The brothers didn‚Äôt want to activate anything at that point probably because they wanted to secure the civilians? Unsure, just my speculation!

Armin is the one who attacked Eren, but you can theorize why Eren said those things to his friends"
23rd_altacc,PotatooFace,"yeah, my bad . you're right"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LightHouseBigMan,"After literally weeks of just powerpoint talking heads with zero action we are finally getting some ATTACK ON TITAN, instead of the worlds boringest slide show commentary. Still not enough to really save the season though."
LightHouseBigMan,Raknel,"It's not really an action anime. If you don't care about the plot, you're watching the wrong show."
Raknel,LightHouseBigMan,Yes you are 100% correct. It‚Äôs much more of a pointless political talking head kind of show.
LightHouseBigMan,pinkmanpunk,you just dont get it
pinkmanpunk,LightHouseBigMan,Na. It's like baiting people with the first season which was full of cool titan stuff only to pull a switcheroo in the last season with a bunch of talking heads. There's a good way to do exposition and slideshow talking heads aint it chief.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SNESisKing9,I have never wanted to punch a child so bad until seeing Gabi's character development over the last handful of episodes
SNESisKing9,woolstarr,"People need to stop acting so righteous and downvoting Gabi hate man, The character is a brainwashed annoyance protected by plot armor...

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Typhooonnn,"My disappointment is immeasurable. This half of season 4 ended at the wrong point completely. Had the potential to do what attack on titan did best, give a brilliant cliffhanger, but no. Really despise Mappa for this one."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Particular-Bike3713,"It‚Äôs so weird now, because now I‚Äôm kinda cheering for the Marley side instead of the Paradis side. Since eren might be playing zeke, then maybe eren, pieck, reiner, the armin + gang, and Levi and others could fight against the euthanization plan."

MemeboiRob,Hange11037,"Yelena is neither Marleyan nor Eldian as far as I know. She supports Zeke specifically and since Eren is working with Zeke she supports him. She manipulated some Marleyan volunteers like Grior to work for her pretending that she and Zeke were helping Marley, but given that she shot him in the head she obviously doesn‚Äôt actually support them. Like Hange figured out a few episodes ago, she hates Marleyans but she‚Äôll work with them if it helps her and Zeke‚Äôs plan."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DerbyKirby123,"Antinatlism intensity so hard. Why do they believe that destroying whole humanity with all its potential is equivalent to no suffering in the future? 

Why do you care about the future if you and future generations will be dead anyway? 
Not all suffering is physical only. The fact that you will know that all humanity will be destroyed is more painful and severe to the current people than all the potential suffering in the future.

This is huge contradiction not to mention that the say ‚Äúlife is suffering‚Äù is subjective and that not everyone think that they don‚Äôt have purpose,values, and goals in their lives."
DerbyKirby123,cybersidpunk,"not whole humanity, just the eldians. the future generations of non eldians will be peaceful as they wont be in constant fear of eldians and potential future generations that would have been born will be saved from living lives of being constantly discriminated to maybe even having to live like marlayan-eldians or even worse."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Recciballo,"I just cannot resist for part 2, maybe i'll go with the manga"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lavivachica,wow i really hope what Pieck said to Gabi about resonates with her. I want to see a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù Gabi arc
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheAmzy,"I don't know wether to wait for the anime or start the manga, why such a long wait :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrocodileSunday,Anyone know what manga number I need to buy?  I can‚Äôt wait for the anime hahaha.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LuckyRoro,"Eldians aren't the source of all suffering and taking them out of the equation won't 'save the world'. The war, prejudice, and bloodshed are around because that's what corrupt humans do and they'll still continue to create these consequences even after the euthanization plan, even if it's a decade later. 

Other nations are developing weapons even stronger than titans. If titans arent around anymore, everyone is just going to use newer, stronger weapons to oppress each other."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AirIsBreathable,What chapter do I start reading after today‚Äôs episode cause I can‚Äôt wait over half a year
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,much_morre,I have been so fucking happy since reading the manga between S4 ep. 4 and 5. 10/10 good for mental health in the coming months
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,korn96,Does anyone know why that titan put Zeke in its belly? Will it heal him?
korn96,Y2KN,"I would guess to carry him away secretly. If he was carried away on it's arms, someone would see"
Y2KN,korn96,Oh I didn‚Äôt even think of that lol! It truly blows my mind how Titans that he‚Äôs created instinctively protect him.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Brakoli_ok,Marley: Well where we dropping boys?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CourtsideVision,I somehow managed stay away from spoilers to the point that I didn‚Äôt know there was a final season PART 2?!!? I am fucking UPSET! Amazing episode tho. One of my favourite shows of all time but halfway through I realized it couldn‚Äôt end in this episode and thought the whole show would end on a cliffhanger
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joseph31091,Is the titan eating zeke or is he controlling the titan to make him regenerate faster? Titan just put her in his stomach.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheFenixxer,Wtf happened to Levi? Did he die? Did he became the titan that rescued Zekke? I NEED ANSWERS
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,XCCGX,What chapter of the manga I'd this on
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Throwaway56138,WHAT THE FUCK???????????????????????????? IS LEVI ALIVE??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chano024,"Honestly if I have to wait this long for part 2, I‚Äôll just wait for all of it to come out. I felt so blue balled this season waiting a week between each episode, I can‚Äôt go through that again. When it‚Äôs all released I‚Äôll just watch the whole season in it‚Äôs entirety."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditer51,We seriously have to wait till winter of next fucking year to see the next episode?!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jadeluminara,"Wow, I‚Äôm really glad we‚Äôre getting a second half of the final season! Does anyone know how long it will take to read the manga? I really want to read it now and that'll give me something to do in the meantime. Also, what the heck!! This episode was done in the blink of an eye"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DCC503,I made it through this year with only hearing about two  (minor spoilers) before they aired! So surprising
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thetruerhy,I hope part 2 has better visuals and animations.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,r17v1,which chapter did it end at?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pHNPK,"So I started reading the manga at 115 to match today's episode, already can see I should have been reading the manga all along."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,captain-deadpool_19,No one's gonna talk about titan levi?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,evan1932,"What I don't understand is how Yelena's nation and other nations were infiltrated using the same wine strategy. I thought Eldians were the only transform with Zeke's spinal fluid, since after all they are the race of titans. Perhaps other nations are using Eldians in roles where they'd be able to get access to Marleyan wine? I'd like an explanation on this if there's any."
evan1932,realkin1112,"they weren't infiltrated using the wine, they were just defeated by Marley using the titan powers"
evan1932,Kronos45,Eldians are living in multiple countries remember? Udo is an eldian who's family came from a foreign country.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Peanutpapa,So did Eren start the Rumbling?
Peanutpapa,realkin1112,"he just transformed, he needs to come in contact with Zeke, or at least that is the plan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,visual_overflow,I love this show but DAMN THESE CLIFF HANGERS.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ni-THiNK,"Couldnt Eren just eat Piek right there? That‚Äôs one less enemy and he might get some of her memories, exposing the Marleyan invaders?"
ni-THiNK,cybersidpunk,getting memories isnt that easy and fast. eren didnt get his dad till season 3 and porco also didnt have any from ymir.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,barydos,Mikasa
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nikhil_Subba,I guess my suggestions to all is to read manga before the next chapter. Because next chapter is last and its gonna make a major headline and there's gonna be a lot of spoilers so its very difficult to avoid spoilers until the anime comes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gaysaucemage,"What was up with that titan ripping open it‚Äôs stomach and placing Zeke inside instead of eating him? He looked so weakened, I doubt he could order it at that point.

Do pure titans just never want to eat Zeke for some reason? Was that pure titan Levi?"
gaysaucemage,SAC_730,"Popular theory is its the same titan that was carrying him that he ripped up, since its last order was to carry him/protect him once it regenerated it found zeke and continued its mission"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dratseb,"Well, no way I can wait a year. I'm going to read the Manga!"
dratseb,cybersidpunk,you are lucky because you can read all the chapters in colored except the last chapter of course...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Luck2me2,Anyone else find armins laughing really out of character? I feel like he wouldn‚Äôt support that plan. Maybe there is more to it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheMagicElephant156,So does anyone think eren is actually going w zekes plan? And anyone have a guess for why armin started crying? That was def fake or explained using a lie right?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KoS1596,And now we wait
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bababoye_,So did Armin really started crying after Yelena said their massive plan? Was it really dat moving for him to start crying and not grieving it?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rks1603,"How many sides are there, and what are they?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Applefarmer124,I wonder how much time eren has left it cant be much at this point. It feels like forever ago he got the power of the titans
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RtR97,So the rumbling will likely happen or almost start or something like that obviously since it‚Äôs a major plot point. So part of my theory assumes the Titans in the wall hit the cha cha and the walls come down kill everyone on the surface then the ground collapses onto the under city effectively ‚Äústerilizing‚Äù all of peridise since everyone is dead
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,devilcation,"Two things i want clarified.

Can Eren use warhammer titan (can be transform into it instead of the Attack titan or is the Warhammer titan abilities inside of him without needing to look like it)

Something tells me that Zeke saw Ymir (that little girl, even shown in trailer) and I think she was the one ordering the titan to save him.. Maybe a stretch but at this point, what ever is possible.

And to make it a bit easier for me is that I keep reminding myself that Eren, Zeke and Armin will eventually die because of the curse of Ymir, if they don't manage to undo it somehow.

I have not been spoiled on the final chapters but it kinda sounds like it's gonna be depressing.

FUCK!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5yk0515,"I'm a little confused. How do missing limbs affect Titan transformations again?

It was kind of established that Shifters can't transform when missing limbs, being the method that Reiner and Berthold used to restrain Eren and Ymir in Season 2, Eren explicitly regenerating his leg before transforming in Liberio and as well as how Zeke was restrained by Levi throughout this season. 

And yet, the very first time Eren transformed on-screen in Season 1 was when he was missing an arm and a leg, and again this episode after Porkchop bit his legs off."
5yk0515,MUSinfonian,"The only times we‚Äôve seen where they cannot transform after having their bodies destroyed like that is **after** they‚Äôve previously transformed (e.g. Eren getting taken by Reiner/Bertholdt in S2) since their bodies are prioritizing the regenerative healing properties over forming their Titan bodies. 

The two instances you‚Äôre referring to are when Eren first finds out his Titan shifting capabilities (S1) and **before** he had shifted into Titan form and the stare down with Reiner (S4). 

Now, the instance with him being in Liberio was also him choosing to regenerate his leg, as evidenced by him maintaining his ‚Äúamputation‚Äù throughout the beginning of the fourth season until Declaration of War and then basically pressing fast forward."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maxobes,Did levi eat zeke in the beginning scene? Did he use titan fluid on himself to save himself from death and to eat the injured zeke? I‚Äôm anime-only just asking if anyone things this as well
maxobes,insertproperusername,"the titan in that scene didn't really eat zeke, she just ""stored"" him in her stomach. 
it's one of levi's squadmates zeke turned into a titan, you can see her in episode 15. 
zeke seems to be able to control the titans he created with hus spinal fluid, so i don't think she's going to do him any harm. 
also, all pure titans we have seen so far had a physical resemblance to their human form, and levi is not a ginger girl as far as i know."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cry32Wolf,can someone pls explain to me more how Zeke's plan is going to work (euthanization) know that Historia is already pregnant?!!!!
Cry32Wolf,rajajackal,yelena touched on this specifically. they will pass down the founding until historia's child eventually grows old and dies
Cry32Wolf,cybersidpunk,euthanization plans work in the way that no one would be able to get pregnant which means free vasectomy for everyone. if a dude gets vasectomy after his wife's already pregnant this wont make his wife not pregnant anymore.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yoda_intoxicated,"Okay so I have a question, Zeke and Eren have the same of end goals of peace but the way they want to go about it is different right? Does Eren want to go along with Zekes euthanasia plan?"
yoda_intoxicated,bluebell135,"I think he agreed with just to team up with him, but he has another plan in mind. That‚Äôs what I think as not having the option of having children is not very freedom like."
bluebell135,yoda_intoxicated,"Okay yeah he seems like he has something else in mind. That makes sense, going to be very hard to hold out from just reading the manga until the second part of the anime lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bluebell135,PLEASE SOMEONE!!!! Should I read the manga?? The anime is more hype but since the last episode of the manga is coming out in like 2 weeks in scared of getting spoiled.
bluebell135,cybersidpunk,"i would say you should. i was an anime only till season 3 and basement reveal just made me start the manga. and now watching part 1 after having read the manga didn't really made it bad for me but maybe 2 times as enjoyable. i still watched all the episodes while they aired with no subs even! seeing that one epic scene get animated is fun!

also there are things in the manga that really can't be animated or wont be animated because it airs on TV and has tp be PG which is not the problem with the manga.

also you can read all the chapters except the last one in color!
i would say try reading from some of the chapters before ep 16 and if you like it continue after it."
bluebell135,Raknel,"Avoid anything AoT related for a few weeks and you'll be fine. With the anime on break and the manga ending, most assholes will move on to spoiling the next thing. It'll be easier to go unspoiled soon."
Raknel,bluebell135,I hope really hope I don‚Äôt get spoiled
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dreamland96,"I should have clarified I was taking about the female titan he was fighting Levi with, not Hange. He crushed the titan‚Äôs skull and threw the pieces at Levi. At the end of the scene you can see her severed tongue twitch, meaning she can regenerate"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hello_all_Im_Khan,When is episode 76 coming out?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cmtr2113,Guys if you go to the season 4 trailer and got to 1:49 and set it to slow you can see a lot of things that are happening in part 2 including what happened to Levi.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AtlLifter20,I knew Pieck wasn‚Äôt totally on Erens side when she told him about Zeke‚Äôs secret powers. She did that to throw him off so the team could crumble from within.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Akhil123484,What happened to Levi?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JOExHIGASHI,"Zeke's euthanasia plan is stupid. I thought armin was laughing at how dumb it was. I swear a better plan would be to awaken the wall titans and push the island farther away.

I'm predicting Erin to betray Zeke and use his founding titan a different way and make all eldians super powerful

And he should have been nicer to armin and mikasa. Not only are they his oldest/only friends but they're valuable members of the military. Mikasa is just badass and armin is the collosal titan. Also Mikasa has political value because of her lineage"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Squish_94,Finally got to watch this episode (free account lol) and honestly I'm kinda pissed that they ended like that... really thought a bit more was gonna happen.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cw423,I don't know which side to root for anymore
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ganggangthagodsquad,when are they going to reveal yelena as armin's long-lost twin?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jageshgoyal,What do you guys think? Will Rumbling happen?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hohenhorn,binging that entire season in one sitting was too much at once and now im sitting in the bathroom floor at 3 am with a headache still trying to process stuff from episode 1 ‚úÖ

###NEW EPISODE SPOILERS BELOW

###MANGA READERS INSTEAD HELP PROTECTING ANIME ONLIES FROM SPOILERS BY REPORTING SPOILERS IN THIS THREAD!"
jollyradtime,Q_Man_Group,"You really see it in his face when he's being taken away. It looks less like betrayal and more like ""holy shit this is what I made my child do"""
jollyradtime,nomindbody,For me though the line is still clear with Floch: power through cowardice aka a d-bag.
jollyradtime,ipaidgymfee,"AOT might not always have the regular ingredients of  a Shonen style, but when it comes to Portraying bad guys it's definitely follows the Shonen style.  
No one is good or bad, their circumstances turned them into what they are now."
jollyradtime,nirvroxx,Semi-related but this is exactly what the essence of last of us 2 was.
jollyradtime,PublicActuator4263,I dont know about that brainwashing your son from a young age and then not telling  your othet son anything but still using him for his plans anyway. Is certainly a opposite aproach but it isnt better if he really wanted to be a good dad he either wouldnt have used eren or at least let him no what the heck was going on before he made his son eat him.
jollyradtime,UnderCraft_383,"At this point I don't think the terms ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" do this show Justice. There is not such thing as good and evil, just which values you have. They can be ""good"" values and the way to reach it might seem clear to you, but to others their ""bad"" ways."
jollyradtime,DapperDaveW,Why did he give his son the terrible burden of two Titan shifters then?  And why didn't he even tell Eren any of the truth first?
jollyradtime,NoU1337420,I don‚Äôt care about logic and the point of the story I will always hate gabi
jollyradtime,Nyx470,A good father until he left his family to be eaten alive so his son turn to a titan and fulfilling his revenge.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GutsyEddy,Did anyone else for a split second think that Keith held his own against all of the new recruits?üòÇ
GutsyEddy,Leonhardt_309,100% my first thought when it cut to bloody hands.
Leonhardt_309,xXx69LOVER69xXx,He probably whooped like 2/3 but those numbers just don't work out.
GutsyEddy,Prof_Black,Keith antagonised his recruits to save them.
Prof_Black,GutsyEddy,"That makes sense tbh, I was really wondering how he was going to handle that situation when I watched the 17 min episode. If that‚Äôs the case he‚Äôs a great guy."
Prof_Black,sexy-melon,Yep. This is what I got from that scene. They were hesitant to fight so he tried to save them.
Prof_Black,Extraterrestrialy,I Believe that was his intention as well. So that none will be killed for the sake of not putting hands on him
GutsyEddy,OOM-32,Mf does throw shade to be fair.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lordofthekebabs,monke...
lordofthekebabs,le_snikelfritz,I went from cheering when Levi dunked on Zeke to feeling so bad for him in the span of an hour that's crazy
le_snikelfritz,ArianaAnzu,Hour? More like 15 minutes!
le_snikelfritz,DanyDragonQueen,"I must be heartless because I still hate Zeke :/

I felt bad for kid Zeke but as an adult, he's murdered way too many scouts (and enjoyed it) for me to feel bad for him."
le_snikelfritz,OOM-32,Smol monke makes me change my sides quite quickly. Poor kid was so abused by everyone.
le_snikelfritz,onigiri_dorkk,"""when Levi dunked on Zeke"" I love this so much"
le_snikelfritz,samhinshy,"Same, this show is wild!!"
lordofthekebabs,lisbethslander,sad monke
lordofthekebabs,lonewolf0406,So monke's plan was to kill off everyone/turn them into titans so they can't make bebe?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rice-Paddy-Daddy,Throughout ep 15 I kept thinking about how Carla said that she believes Eren is special because he was born into this world. This resolution of sterilization can‚Äôt be what Eren truly think is the answer
Rice-Paddy-Daddy,cgoodies5,What a good call back.
Rice-Paddy-Daddy,soupybiscuit,"Was looking for your comment. I don‚Äôt think Eren would agree with this, either. He was so cold and terrorist-like in his last few appearances, and especially in this week‚Äôs appearance‚Äîwhich makes me think he is using Zeke now to get what he wants to happen."
Rice-Paddy-Daddy,justaverage00,I think that's Zeke's plan but Eren wants to do the Rumbling
justaverage00,Tordrew,I still can‚Äôt get over how stupid ‚Äúthe rumbling‚Äù sounds. It‚Äôs like a god damn wrestling move
Rice-Paddy-Daddy,titanFood101,How Eren used ‚Äúbrother‚Äù when talking to seek was so out of character for him. I think he used it to manipulate Zeke
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SagaciousFish5,"It's funny how Eren's original oath to kill every titan and Zeke's wish for the eradication of eldians have conflated like this, I don't see how Eren can think this is the right way"
SagaciousFish5,that-other-redditor,My guess is that Eren will get rid of the ability for Eldians to transform into Titans.
that-other-redditor,JakeMeOff11,"That doesn‚Äôt seem like a viable solution. It wouldn‚Äôt make the world hate Eldians any less, only take away their empowerment."
SagaciousFish5,Mr_Sarcastic12,"He originally made that oath because he thought it would end human suffering. But now he understands that the world encompasses more than just his own people, so I think you're right. Removing Eldian suffering by simply getting rid of them wouldn't solve anything. Strife and war would still play out for the rest of the world, and removing titans from the equation only simplifies things a little bit."
SagaciousFish5,jsaltee,"my question is when did eren change from ""i want to do the rumbling and destroy my enemies"" to ""i want to end the eldian bloodline?"""
SagaciousFish5,Darth_Peregrine,"Actually it makes perfect since, I still hate it but thinking about it I understand it.

Zeke want Eldians gone from the world, he will destroy their ability to procreate to do so. Destroying the ability to procreate will prevent more children from being born, when Marley runs out of people to turn into Titans the Titans can finally be destroyed. Destroying all the Titans is what Eren has always wanted to do, and until every Eldian is dead the Titans can never truly be gone.

&#x200B;

Frick I hate Eren now but it fits with his story perfectly."
SagaciousFish5,mighty__orbot,"I can‚Äôt believe Eren is being truthful about this. Not after the way he told Armin he always hated him, that was obviously not the true Eren we used to know. Somebody‚Äôs playing a long con."
mighty__orbot,RandomDataUnknown,YASSS finally someone gets it. When he told Mikasa and Armin that he's always hated them i was like it's gotta be to protect them somehow cause there is no way he's ever hated them.
SagaciousFish5,OOM-32,"I mean, Eldians are potential titans right? If you kill them you get rid of titans for real, right?"
OOM-32,AClassyTurtle,"Yeah that‚Äôs how I understood it. Eren wants to kill all the titans. It took him a while to...digest...the fact that the true identity of titans is Eldians, but now I think he‚Äôs made up his mind to stick to his original plan of eradication"
SagaciousFish5,ThrowRAmiscellaneous,"Honestly when I watched the S3 episode when Eren was chained to be eaten by Historia, and he was so struck and guilt ridden by his father‚Äôs brutality against the royals, I kinda had a feeling there would be some consequences to that. Eren looked too easily convinced the following episode that him possessing the founding was fine. Also Hange‚Äôs whole inner monologue of how unsustainable the cycle of inheritance was...damn the foreshadowing to this was good. The writing amazes me when I thought I couldn‚Äôt be more amazed."
SagaciousFish5,remmon22,"Right, I think he's just going along to take control of the founding's power. Maybe he's gonna do the opposite, kill everyone in the continent, so Eldians can live free without prejudice."
SagaciousFish5,nomindbody,"Unless this is his way to access all Titans by leading Zeke with his plan then flipping it. Using Zeke as his vessel to kill  all the Titans at once, even himself. Eren already knows he can control Titans by touching a royal blood member and he already knows Diana Fritz (Zeke's mom) was a royal from Grisha's memories. Eren's mom's words ""He was special just by being born"" makes me think he won't be with Zeke's plan. He loves his mom too much and she didn't have to die. He still hates the Titans and himself, he has a limited time so he will take down all the Titans. But I'm not sure how he'll save Armin if he does that :/"
nomindbody,nelson64,"I have a feeling that he'll be able to turn all titans back to humans, including both pure and special titans. 

Then using his founding powers...maybe uh...idk absorb the special ones (havent thought this out entirely yet lol)??? and then change Eldians' DNA so that they can no longer transform into titans and then finally kill himself with all the titans inside him. Since Eldians can no longer inherit titans, the titan powers are lost forever!"
SagaciousFish5,Serbaayuu,"> I don't see how Eren can think this is the right way

The world can't continue to exist in a peaceful state if Titans exist.  Ever, really.  There'll always be the threat of them appearing and bringing lives to ruin.

If the curse can't actually be cured, if it truly is fate that the Eldian race is doomed to be at risk of turning into Titans (at the whims of whoever holds the 9) at any time, then the only solution is to either exile them -- which didn't really work -- or end them.  Doing that consensually is the ethical way, although in this case it's more like a couple of Eldians versus a bunch of other Eldians to make that final decision."
SagaciousFish5,Neeko2lo,"The only way to create peace is if all humans are eldians and are entirely controlled by a peaceful founding titant, no ?"
Neeko2lo,-ShaiHulud-,"But that implies that one individual would need to hold control, and this goes completely against Eren‚Äôs ideology (i.e. Freedom above all)."
SagaciousFish5,Bi_Boio,The only way to rid the world of conflict and the threat of titans is to rid the world of Eldians I guess
SagaciousFish5,Calvinball88,"Yeah, I'm troubled by the whole arc of ""lets euthanize a ethny"" as a good solution. Obviously Eren fucking up with Mikasa and Armin also is super weird.

Since they like deceiving spectators I guess there's a fundamental reason we've not been given yet, but I Feel pretty meh since the last couple episodes.."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FreddyFahad,"Only one episode is left from this season , fucking hell ..... How will I spend my weekends now"
FreddyFahad,lisbethslander,Will there be a part II?
lisbethslander,Kawala_,"yeah im very confused, an official trailer described it as the season finale but whats going on?"
FreddyFahad,phillycheeseguy,There‚Äôs only one episode left?
FreddyFahad,explosivecurry13,just keep moving forward
FreddyFahad,Alexandre_Man,"Of this first half of a season, you mean."
FreddyFahad,PM_ME_RIDER_HENTAI,Are you sure? I thought the Manga is going on for another 40 or so episodes.
PM_ME_RIDER_HENTAI,spammmmm1882,I‚Äôm pretty sure the manga ends in April
FreddyFahad,OOM-32,"Shit is gonna go down hard, damn"
FreddyFahad,SuperScrodum,"Anyone know why the episode numbers provided at the title screen does the match the actual episode number, and is in fact one behind?"
SuperScrodum,Nordenfang,Maybe they started from 0
FreddyFahad,namelessking20,Same. At least my hero academia will be out soon.
namelessking20,Cry32Wolf,didn't watch this anime yet.... how do you compare it to AOT
FreddyFahad,Jeremizzle,"Damn, next week is the last one already??? It feels like we're only just getting started."
FreddyFahad,NaughtyDreadz,That's not accurate
FreddyFahad,nomindbody,Wait what?! The next one is the last episode üò≠
FreddyFahad,alabamamamba,I‚Äôm restarting it!
FreddyFahad,Hoboryufeet,Are we definitely getting a part 2 or film? I wouldn't mind a film tbh because more likely to have nice animation.
FreddyFahad,benttwig33,only one episiode left total? or is their a season4 part 2?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Red_Rocket_Rider,I couldn't believe it when they revealed Zeke to be a r/childfree moderator.
Red_Rocket_Rider,OOM-32,Fuck dude you got me there
Red_Rocket_Rider,YieldingSweetblade,Literally r/antinatalism personified
YieldingSweetblade,HellspawnedJawa,Christ that's a depressing subreddit
YieldingSweetblade,hollyviolet96,"Wow I kinda regret going down that rabbit hole. What a fascinating and depressing position to take. And they absolutely can‚Äôt be reasoned with because they put no moral worth on happiness, pleasure, joy- that‚Äôs all overridden by all potential suffering. Poor fuckers. Zeke‚Äôs plan is not meant to sound appealing!"
YieldingSweetblade,Serbaayuu,"Well, he's right though.

A world with Titans is untenable.  Unless there was also a way to just biologically erase the Titan curse from Eldians, the next best thing is making sure the Eldians peacefully die out so the curse goes with them.

It's better than millennia of war and back-and-forth persecution.  The Eldians can simply live their lives and the world can move on.  (Not that this fixes the human desire for conflict in general.)"
Red_Rocket_Rider,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,my siiiiides omg
Red_Rocket_Rider,gHHqdm5a4UySnUFM,Now I want someone to match all the characters up with the subreddit they would moderate
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PK_RocknRoll,Being Levi truly is suffering
PK_RocknRoll,ShaidarHaran2,"Guy has very few friends left living, squad gone, Erwin gone, shitty childhood, no parents, and a new round of comrades turned into titans and him being forced to kill them to get out. 

Really keeps piling on him. They can't do him dirty like that with the bomb, he has to get some comeuppance."
ShaidarHaran2,cozyduck,"That's why Levi is the main character for me. 
He is humanity - through all suffering, meaningless death, we strive to seek meaning, we do not capitulate to the void. I just love Levi as the ongoing manifestation of that people can and *do* go on despite the shittiest circumstances."
ShaidarHaran2,tylerforward,You didn't even mention losing Petra and breaking the news (at least it's implied) to her father. One of the saddest scenes I thought in the series so far.
ShaidarHaran2,AClassyTurtle,"And time after time, his choices end poorly. He let Eren decide whether to use his titan to fight Annie in the forest, and the result was all of his friends dying and Annie getting away. He tried to keep Zeke alive in the battle for Shiganshina, and Zeke got away. Actually that last bit has happened like two more times since then: trusting Zeke‚Äôs plan and then not killing him when he had the chance in this episode. Levi‚Äôs doing his best and it always turns out poorly for everyone he cares about"
PK_RocknRoll,Flying-Turtl3,"How many times has his ""squad"" been killed now? 3? 4?


And the last time by his own hand... Rough"
Flying-Turtl3,ThrowRAmiscellaneous,It kills me that Levi probably feels profound guilt over having to kill all 30 of his men despite being cornered into it with no choice. His last lines that scene was ‚ÄúVladis...are you still in there?‚Äù And finally a resigned ‚Äúguys...‚Äù he says he had no hesitation but he def feels like shit making that choice despite not hesitating out of necessity. He cares so much about people and it always ends up like this
PK_RocknRoll,suri14,"The powerful and dark moment when tells Zeke something on the likes of ""you ve no idea how many of my comrades we ve killed"" .. all  of erwins plans needed minimum 50 sacrifices just to prove some small hunch of his.."
PK_RocknRoll,Teves3D,"Strength invites challenge, challenge incites conflict and conflict... breeds catastrophe.."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FreddyFahad,I WILL DIE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO LEVI !
FreddyFahad,santiagof2p,"When he explained that the spear goes off if Zeke moves his neck, I thought 'man, he is going to be awfully close to that explosion'"
santiagof2p,Send_Me_Puppies,"Yeah I was hoping his Ackermann reflexes/durability would kick in, yet to be seen but I hope he's okay."
santiagof2p,jhames1867,"I'd just assumed he was bluffing, and he was trying to fuck with him by making him think he had a way to end his suffering, since Zeke posed no real threat to him in that state.

Then everything went slow motion and my heart sank"
santiagof2p,Mafamaticks,"I was expecting it to be a fake. 

Imagine if Zeke did that only for it to NOT go off. Bruh the despair..."
santiagof2p,BigMac518,"Levi misjudged Zeke. He thought Zeke cared about his own life more than anything, and so he never suspected Zeke would actually blow himself up like that."
FreddyFahad,le_snikelfritz,I mean....he has to be dead right? :( A thunderstick went off right in front of him
le_snikelfritz,Leonhardt_309,"\[Pure speculation\] I'd say a 0% chance Levi is dead and like a 50% chance Zeke is dead. I just don't think they would kill off Levi and leave his death a mystery until the next episode. If he ever dies, I imagine it would be a big thing. Zeke had a whole flashback and final words, so I think he could be dead. I do think Levi may lose something like Hange and Erwin did."
le_snikelfritz,StopTheFeed,Levi is the Jon Snow of AOT
le_snikelfritz,gzmu12,"If they killed Levi off like that, it would be fucking pathetic. There‚Äôs about a 0% chance he‚Äôs dead in my opinion. I could be wrong though"
le_snikelfritz,EChocos,"No main character of any fiction has died like that off camera, ever."
le_snikelfritz,trashassmemes69,There‚Äôs absolutely no chance
le_snikelfritz,AbaramaGolding,what if Levi injects himself with spinal fluid and eats Zeke? I'm sure he must have it around because he has mentioned it several times in the past episodes
le_snikelfritz,ShaidarHaran2,"Looked like he went flying with all his limbs intact, so if his reaction times let him turn around and jump a bit, maybe he's just out in the field with a few broken bones and burnt skin...They wouldn't do him dirty with such a quick death, right?"
le_snikelfritz,Soundtallica,"Nah... Levi's not an idiot, he would definitely consider the possibility of Zeke activating  the thunder spear before trapping him like that in such close proximity to him. And given his Ackermann blood and general OP-ness he'd definitely be able to get away in time."
le_snikelfritz,Basic-Climate-5409,i think he might survive that most of the main character dying by explosion and not getting to see their dead body always survive
FreddyFahad,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"I think it'd be really hard to kill off Levi in a fair 'fight'.. if he does go out, being taken out in a circumstance like this would make sense. my guess is that he'll be injured and sidelined."
FreddyFahad,Somethingblueee,There is no way Levi could die in a stupid situation like that so I'm pretty sure he is fine.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,strahanb08,I don‚Äôt like how my boy Eren talked to my Girl Mikasa like that.... that shit hurted
strahanb08,ForShotgun,I kinda hate how the two episodes ended up bundled because I really wanted to see how everyone reacted to that part
ForShotgun,GoldenSpermShower,Yeah seems like very little people are talking about the first episode...
strahanb08,SuperScrodum,"How he treated them was the most shocking thing this season IMO.

I just can‚Äôt believe he really feels that way. It was just four or five episodes ago he talked about how much he wants to protect them (it was a flashback, but I think he carried those feelings when he went to meet Zeke).

I‚Äôm hoping Eren did this for a reason and he really doesn‚Äôt not feel that way about them. Maybe it‚Äôs all apart of his plan. And I like to think it‚Äôs his own plan. Not Zekes, Yelena, the Jaegerists, the military, the scouts, or anybody. 

He very clearly stated that he is ‚Äúfree‚Äù so I think that could be seen as him acting all on his own. I have a feeling that Eren knows what to do having the founding Titan and seeing all the memories through the link all titans have, whatever that is called.

Or maybe I just don‚Äôt want to give up on Eren :/"
SuperScrodum,Ghostmerc86,"Didn't the old Attack Titan say something about protecting Armin and Mikasa just before he gave the power to Grisha?

This alludes to the power of future sight and may even mean Erin is still trying to protect both of them still"
strahanb08,jbere75,Facts this should be higher up. So much crazy stuff happened and Eren has always seemed to take Mikasa for granted but damn what a 180
jbere75,broskeymchoeskey,There‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs not lying out of his ass. He probably cares so much about Armin and Mikasa that he doesn‚Äôt want them to be involved because he knows how dark his road is going to get.
jbere75,ShaidarHaran2,"Yeah I still feel sure something else is up, even though he says he's acting of his own free will. I thought maybe he was trying to prove the point, when Armin went to attack him it seemed like Mikasa moved without even realizing it. Maybe he wants to break that somehow to free her?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StopTheFeed,...and the Worst Parent of The Year award goes to Grisha
StopTheFeed,wintersoIdier,I'd give it to the woman who slit her son's throat then her own
StopTheFeed,Skyking035,twice
StopTheFeed,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"damn right. I remember at the end of S3 around the basement reveal, Grisha has some awareness on how/why this all backfired on him.. but man, he really didn't mention how badly he handled Zeke. he had that shit coming."
StopTheFeed,OOM-32,"Absolutely. Holy shit, they used him more than a napkin."
StopTheFeed,TheGladex,The best thing about this show is how brilliantly it portrays how a broken system brings out the worst in people.
StopTheFeed,FH_Bunny,Twice.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,peniwisefunneh,So why did Eren and Zeke not touch and do the the pp cut plan right away in Liberio
peniwisefunneh,Dimmadeezy,You probably want to be inside the walls when you unleash the titans to flatten the earth. Plus they have no idea how it works so they want to be somewhere safe first.
peniwisefunneh,justaverage00,"because they have to be titans for it to work and I guess they thought if they transformed in the heart of Marley, they'd be immediately attacked and probably get beat. then Marley could have one of the warriors eat them and now Eldia is screwed"
justaverage00,PapaNicholsUSA,So why didn‚Äôt the just go to some field and do it?
justaverage00,chipthehippie,They don't have to be titans for it to work. They weren't titans when they intentionally avoided touching hands.
peniwisefunneh,strahanb08,Because Zeke has spilled his whole beans. But Eren Hasn‚Äôt he‚Äôs still up to something. And I think Eren Still wants to save his friends and people. Just not let them have Children. Thus the rumbling
peniwisefunneh,fist_my_muff2,"What I don't get, Euthenasia means to kill. Not just prevent from having kids. Is their plan not to just kill all Eldians?"
fist_my_muff2,VindictiveJudge,"Yeah, sterilization is more accurate to what Zeke's stated goal is. Might just be dodgy translation."
peniwisefunneh,InsideContext5,If they activated it right then Eldia would have no bargaining power with the rest of the world and be immediately invaded. I imagine Zeke is planning to avoid that by taking action pre euthanasia
peniwisefunneh,yanivbl,"I don't get why he didn't switch side at Shingashina. His life goal was to find an ally with the founding titan and then by pure luck the guy with the power turns out to be his half brother, so all he needs is Eren to cooperate willingly, and yet he proceeds to massacre his entire corp. And would have needed to take down Reiner, Betholt and the Cart anyway, he couldn't let them bring Eren to Marley."
peniwisefunneh,Page211,I think I saw a possible explanation somewhere in this thread saying that they needed to activate the rumbling first to threaten the world and buy time for the 100 year euthanization plan. Also I think they don't really know the extent of their powers yet and best to do so in a safe area rather than a hospital in Marley.
peniwisefunneh,kreadus005,Demo of the rumbling needs proximity to the wall titans
peniwisefunneh,Twindo,Prolly cuz Eren doesn‚Äôt really want too. Just my speculation.
peniwisefunneh,pandachestpress,"They still need to keep the other countries off of Paradis' back. If they touched at that point, Marley was still planning on invading Paradis anyways and will still result in a violent end for Eldians. They need to find a way to carry out the euthanasia plan while also keeping the other countries from invading so that Eldians can live out the rest of their lives peacefully."
peniwisefunneh,lordofthekebabs,Because first they need to be in Paradise and activate the rumbling in order to protect the last Eldians from outside world for 100 years
peniwisefunneh,RepulsiveEstate,"Because I think part of the plan is the destruction of the governments. Eren killed all those people and decimated Marley's leadership and I think Zeke intended or will do the same thing to the paradisians. The wine was meant for the senior officers for instance.

If they did their thing in Liberio then Marley would have simply continued to genocide and kill Eldians and invade/destroy the island. There's a deeper plan here than just spay/neuter your big-heads. Then there's another angle I think Eren himself has. Whatever it is that makes him see himself as free."
peniwisefunneh,Toolazytolink,Got something to do Shiganshina maybe?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Born2BeFr33,Finally we can understand what Zeke's and Eren's intentions really are.
Born2BeFr33,PharmerTE,Why do they have to wait and do in in Paradis? Couldn't they just have done it when they met up in Liberio?
PharmerTE,TeddyFatesh,"Firstly they need to be Titans (at least Zeke does) to do it so if they start it in Liberio they are going to get captured immediately.  Secondly the Titans are in the wall on Paradis Island, they won't reach Liberio until its too late."
PharmerTE,VinegarPot,"Marley will attack Paradis regardeles of the Eldians ability to reproduce or transform into titans.

So Zeke wants to use the rumbling as a threat to secure Paradis' safety for the 100 years the eutanasia needs to function. For that they need to be at the island and they need to show the threat to the world."
PharmerTE,Dimmadeezy,I assume you‚Äôd want to be inside the walls when you send the titans out to flatten the earth.
PharmerTE,LordOfNightsong,"I think there's a reason no one is mentioning and it was already hinted at in these two episodes. As the previous beast titan says, it takes two. One of royal blood and the founding titan. Just because Zekes plan is euthanasia doesn't mean that's Erens. Zeke realizes this and agrees not to touch as he doesn't trust Eren yet. 

Even so, the ground work is set that the founding titan has to agree to zekes plan and that eren operates under his own free will aka not zekes will. Be prepared for Eren to choose a different outcome when him and Zeke attempt the plan."
PharmerTE,stillsebs,"> Couldn't they just have done it when they met 

After transforming Levi's men, Zeke mentioned that Paradis didn't understand what the might of the world collapsing on the island meant. Which means he most likely wants Paradis to survive, just not to bear children anymore. They probably will fight for Eldia in Paradis and take a stand vs the world.

Meaning he wants to keep passing down titans but only until there's nobody else to inherit, because will have slowily died out. It'd a peaceful ending for a empire built on the blood of humanity (although to be fair, everything we know the Eldian empire that is negative could just be propaganda from Marley). Still, it's not a terrible idea because as long as Eldians exist, Titans will terrorize everyone unless everyone magically agrees to peace and we all know that would never happen.

Unfortunately, the rest of the world will collapse on them sooner or later and unless Eldia wins that war, Titans will keep existing forever.

Eren's the wildcard here. I feel like he still wants to protect his friends, so he might deviate from Zeke's plan to accomplish that.

Also, Levi will never EVER believe anything that comes from Zeke's or Eren's mouth. So Levi will most likely die due to being so stubborn and ignorant. Yes, he's a badass, but he has made ZERO effort to understand Zeke's or Eren's motivations, he takes EVERYTHING at face value and that's clearly a huge mistake when there's so many things he doesn't understand."
PharmerTE,JossWhedonsDick,"What if it's because they need to maintain the castration? If a Founding -- Royal pair can sterilize everyone, doesn't it stand to reason that it could be reversed? Are Zeke, Historia, and Historia's child the only ones with royal blood? It is in Zeke's best interests (not that he would've known this in Liberio) to kill Historia and her unborn child, then kill himself, thus cutting off the lines of royal blood forever and making the sterilization permanent. Historia's pregnancy just got a lot more important (though I can't see how they'll fit that in addition to everything else going on into the last ep)."
PharmerTE,gHHqdm5a4UySnUFM,I guess they still have to protect the Founding Titan until the euthanasia plan fully plays out. Otherwise someone could take control of that Titan and undo the sterilization?
PharmerTE,Charmingly_Conniving,Why couldnt eren do that with historia?
PharmerTE,ambitious_worm,Does Zeke know he has royal blood? I think his mother‚Äôs identity as a descendant of Fritz may have been hidden from him.
PharmerTE,deokkent,"Why does Eren need Zeke even?

Eren has access to other Royals. And he/his father has consumed a few."
PharmerTE,YohAsa,The point of the Euthanization plan is to give the remaining Eldians peace as they live out their lives. They need a deterrent for the rest of their life span. That deterrent is the rumbling. They need to display that power through a small scale rumbling
Born2BeFr33,GutsyEddy,"Sort of. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like those weren‚Äôt Eren‚Äôs true intention. He wishes to fight, survive, save Mikasa and Armin but also wants to end Eldians? Something isn‚Äôt right here and I hope he doesn‚Äôt end up betraying Zeke because I really grew on him, especially after this episode."
GutsyEddy,BigIron28,Probably setting zeke up so hard so that it hurts more  when he gets betrayed
GutsyEddy,TheChrisLambert,I agree. But he‚Äôs like 89% chance betraying Zeke
Born2BeFr33,FreddyFahad,I guess I need to rewatch this episode cuz I didn't understand shit üòÇ
FreddyFahad,JordanIII,"Basically the founding titan can modify eldian's bodies, so their plan is to make it so that they can no longer reproduce to 'save' the children from this cruel world. If they're never born into that world they don't have to suffer either"
FreddyFahad,matthieuC,Planet wide sterilization for eldians
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FHI_iSmile,"
Some nice backstory for Zeke in this episode (ep 15). This episode added more depth to his character and I def have more respect for him after seeing that. Removing all eldians to remove all the suffering is an interesting way of seeing and solving things. And it was interesting to see Eren somewhat was agreeing with him, but I doubt Eren is all in on that plan.
Like Zeke and plenty of other characters has said in this show, the world is just cruel."
FHI_iSmile,tbo1992,"> I doubt Eren is all in on that plan

The researcher beast titan had one line that was ""However, the power isn't yours to use. That right lies with the Founding Titan"".  
  
You can bet your ass that was a piece of foreshadowing."
tbo1992,gignac,Yep. And the trusting line
FHI_iSmile,BringBckOldGyms,"For anime onlys this was the last piece of the puzzle: Zekes backstory and motivation.

We waited years for this and it totally paid off!"
BringBckOldGyms,Eddje,His backstory and motivation were great but I do think his plan is a bit underwhelming. Most of this season we were led to believe Zeke was a master schemer and that with his knowledge of the titans he had conjured up such a brilliant plan that Erin had no choice but to sacrifice his comrades and his relationships with them to follow it. Now: I don't even believe Eren is truly in on the plan. The motivation and backstory has just made Zeke look like a tragic child whose given up all hope in life and whose only wish is to satisfy the only person who ever gave him any positive reinforcement.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,marina_kos,I was pretty sure that Zeke will die when we got the flashback explaining his motivations but I still didn't expect the end. I don't think they're gonna take Levi out like that but still give him a break. How much does he have to suffer?
marina_kos,marina_kos,"Also, him killing himself doesn't affect the euthanasia plan? What will Eren do now?"
marina_kos,Red_Rocket_Rider,"I hope nobody replies with spoilers, but I'm sure Zeke is alive. The trap was meant to intimidate and incapacitate him. Levi knows he can't kill him yet."
marina_kos,matthieuC,Historia is still there.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ordinary_chair,"Sooo how does Zeke get to be an honorary Marleyan warrior? He was really struggling with the training but after exposing his parents, he becomes more successful?"
ordinary_chair,Xurban,"he got older and stronger, and he had a new drive to euthanize eldians, whereas before, he didn't really agree with his parents so he couldn't put his entire resolve into becoming a warrior."
Xurban,valarpizzaeris,So you're saying he...devoted his heart?
ordinary_chair,InspireDespair,I think one factor is perceived loyalty to Marley. Turning in the entire restorationist movement probably won him huge points.
ordinary_chair,whats-your-mom-doing,was probably chosen by Mr. Ksaver since they‚Äôre close? he also proved to be loyal to marley by ratting out his parents idk
ordinary_chair,raylolSW,"Beast Titan is great at throwing rocks, and he was great at throwing baseball balls.

Maybe that"
raylolSW,Epic_Meow,tom ksaver said that the beast titan wasn't actually that great in war so i think that zeke was the one who developed that skill as the monkey.
ordinary_chair,Shackal017,"Connection to the previous beast titan, and also the beast titan looks to be their go to for research and not combat. The only exception was Zeke. He is second slowest titan, only slower than colossal, and colossal has it's massive size and steam to protect itself. And my guess is that Zeke was the one who came up with the idea of beast titan basically being artillery because he was interested in baseball. Without Zeke, beast titan can't turn other Eldians into titans and control them, and possibly can't be used as artillery so it becomes really bad combat titan. That is why the previous beast wasn't really a warrior but a researcher and it was most likely used for research only. Between all the titans Marley had he seems the logical choice for them to focus on research on."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jack1066,"Young Zeke was so innocent damn, it makes sense that Ksaver was his replacement dad, Grisha was awful towards him, and whats more, from what we saw in Grisha's memories, he had no clue he was so cold towards Zeke.

Am I right in saying that they said the Beast titan was quite shit before Zeke took it? So his royal blood and natural (?) throwing ability was what turned the beast titan into an actual useful weapon in war?"
Jack1066,loveholic_99,grisha was not clueless about how he treated zeke. in his flashbad in s3 he regreted that and said that he only saw him a royal blood son and that he failed as a father.
loveholic_99,Jack1066,"oh damn I don't remember that, might have to rewatch the whole show now"
Jack1066,Elbeautz,Zekes blood definitely makes him way stronger beast but i took it as ksaver just busted his ass to get the beast and then went full nerd to study titans instead of war. Perhaps marley was okay with it and it was part of the Titan Research
Elbeautz,mdmd33,Someone earlier suggested that his ‚Äúbeast‚Äù Titan may have also looked different..they still have not explained the multiple animals in the various seasons closing & title screens...just a possibility
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Question-Guru,"Eren: I hate people who aren't free. BTW, I'm taking you all as prisoners"
Question-Guru,GoldenSpermShower,"Eren: I'm also taking your ability to reproduce, because"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnselLovesNuts,"Y‚Äôall can hate Gabi, I myself fucking hate Floch."
AnselLovesNuts,5years8months3days,I hope we get to see Levi sew Flochs ass to his face.
5years8months3days,valarpizzaeris,Then Hange gets to kick Floch's stupid ass face in afterward
5years8months3days,jolewhea,This comment is everything.  Floch has been a bitch since day one.
AnselLovesNuts,1234NY,"Floch's the biggest ass in the show because every act of violence he does is gratuitous. From shooting civilians in Liberio to ordering the cadets to beat up Shadis, he's a thug of the highest order who loves inflicting far more pain than is needed for Eren's plan to succeed."
1234NY,pds_king21,And that k pop chili bowl haircut ain't doing him justice either lol
1234NY,Flamingslayer11,He‚Äôs such a bitch. He was a little shit until someone gave him a gun.
1234NY,bexyrex,"Honestly Floch is kinda a fascist. Innitiating subordinates through violence. Obsession with racial purity (Eldians above all others), hyperviolent militarism and nationalism (We will defend Eldia with all our hearts) opposition to parliamentary democracy (Getting rid of all the MPs) and obsession with dictatorship (Eren Jaeger) Totalitarian ambitions (Let's use the rumbling to show the world our power and might).

&#x200B;

Like bruh his whole everything is so fascist the parallels are astounding."
1234NY,Redditer51,"It also doesn't help that he's always involved in battles where characters we love die, but he always makes it out alive.

We lost Erwin and Marlowe (poor Hitch), and then Sasha. Dear God, Sasha.

Edit: the fact that he's the one that got to live, and *this* is what he's doing, is (like Levi said) a sick joke. And I feel like thats intentional."
AnselLovesNuts,Orange__Julius,"I'm prepared to do a complete 180 when they flashback to a Floch childhood episode, at this rate"
AnselLovesNuts,ICantTyping,Fr Keith didn‚Äôt deserve to get beaten to shit like that.

He also seems to get a sadistic kick out of seeing others forced to do his bidding.  
 
He's the worst kind of person to be given power, in any regard."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Elbeautz,Not sure if anyone else caught it but i think eren has a different plan than the jaegerists. Floch kept asking where zeke was but why bother if zekes plan was to escape and meet up in shiganshina?
Elbeautz,justaverage00,"I think their original plan was for Eren to rescue Zeke but if enough time passed or if something went wrong, they would scrap the plan and Zeke would have to escape on his own to meet Eren in Shiganshina. Eren was still asking Armin where Zeke was and Zeke didn't plan on running away until Levi said he was gonna slice him up"
justaverage00,DanyDragonQueen,"My problem with this is, did Eren know Zeke would turn Levi's squad into titans, which had the possibility of leading to Levi's death? Because if Eren knew that was a possibility, that's pretty unforgivable to me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AudaciousXII,Feel like floch is more fucked up than eren and zeke at this point
AudaciousXII,jolewhea,Floch sucks.  And has sucked since the beginning of his character introduction.  There was a brief moment I thought I liked him but it was very fleeting lol.
jolewhea,hosseinxj0152,"We all make mistakes in the heat of passion, jimbo."
AudaciousXII,Teves3D,He‚Äôs doing this for all the wrong reasons. But for now we‚Äôre bystanders we know next to nothing how floch works and I don‚Äôt think we ever will.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JordanIII,"Ok that's it, I'm starting the manga right now there's no way i can wait another week after that ending üò≠"
JordanIII,JordanIII,Can anyone tell me what chapter this episode ended at?
JordanIII,cidalkimos,114 I think
JordanIII,jcordova98,"Honestly same. This week‚Äôs episode was good background knowledge, but the story didn‚Äôt really progress at all. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna feel satisfied enough after next week‚Äôs episode to wait for a part 2."
jcordova98,JordanIII,"Bro be careful, some dude dmed me a major spoiler because of my comment here üòê"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrHikigaya,"Who's side to choose? 

Zeke killed Connie's village, Mike, Erwin and 196 scouts in the battle of Shiganshina and the latest: Levi's 30 soldiers.

At this point I'm down with whatever Mikasa and Armin do. I'm on their side."
DrHikigaya,Lerome,"For me it's absolutely clear. I'm on the side of Paradise Island and the Eldians. The Eldians are regular people, they can only turn to Titans through the spinal fluid. Without it they are normal people. Euthanizing all Eldians is victim blaming, as they suffer because people in power on both sides are using the common Eldians for their own benefits.  


The latest episode explained why Zeke betrayed Grisha in a good fashion, but personally the Euthanasia plan is very weak for me and I expected something better from Zeke."
Lerome,BlackNova169,"Well, technically the Warrior Titans get inherited by an Eldian randomly after their predecessor dies. So even if the average Eldian doesn't transform without spinal fluid, those warrior Titans will continue to persist.

I actually wonder if Eren is going to re-write all the Eldians so that they can't be transformed into the idiot Pure titans, but allow them all to transform into the Sentient Attack Titans. So instead of neutering the Eldians he drastically empowers them... But I guess we'll see in a week?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,purposelessfellow,"""Lets put an armed thunder spear which would explode even on slight movement in zeke who will be just a few feet away from me."" 


**Outstanding move**"
purposelessfellow,No3sc4pe,He didnt consider that Zeke would even see suicide as an option. He thought that Zeke had a central part in the new Eldian world order. We know that Zeke was never the central player of his plan and that all he longed for was to never have been born
No3sc4pe,Kid__Winchester,"Yeah but how does that work, he's a titan. Wouldn't he just regenerate? I'm a little hazy on how far titan regeneration goes lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crab_spy_,"Good god, I knew the eldians were hated but killing your own child and then yourself just because your husband turned out to be eldian is just insane. Ksaver‚Äôs ex-wife is now definitely along with grisha and gabi in my most hated characters list."

crab_spy_,GuyFromGermany,"Why do you hate grisha? I actually like him, he wanted to fight for his nation and actually managed to get the founding titan. Yes he wasn't a loving father but besides that I don't understand that hate he gets..."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,throwaway838392727,Wtf was up with how Eren talked to Mikasa and Armin... those two have given their lives for him. They love him. :(
throwaway838392727,ZeDitto,Seriously. I hope that Eren is just bullshitting as part of some plan.
ZeDitto,techyme008,"He is owl while transferring the attack titan to grisha told to take care of Mikasa & Armin, so there's definitely something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cgoodies5,"Two thoughts/questions. 1, can‚Äôt eren just alter eldians anatomy to not turn into titans? Doesn‚Äôt have to completely render them unable to have kids. 2, so the founding titan gave the Ackermanns an anatomy change to be compelled to protect the founding titan? Or themselves? If that‚Äôs the case why did the ackermanns fall out of favor with the founding titan family? Mikasa‚Äôs lack of freedom thing eren was talking about was real confusing to me"
cgoodies5,magpiethief1,"Regarding question 1, honestly it‚Äôs a good question I‚Äôve been asking myself as well. 

Regarding question 2, Eren is lying. Of course he doesn‚Äôt hate Mikasa or Armin, that much is obvious if we look back at seasons 1-3. He‚Äôs got some ulterior plan going on, and his ‚ÄúAckerman theory‚Äù is just a part of that. For some reason, he needs Mikasa and Armin to turn against him, and cutting them off emotionally is a step to doing that."
cgoodies5,imnotlegendyet,"About question one: Taking eldian's ability to turn into titans wouldn't make the world not hate them. If anything, it'd be easier to kill them all. Idk why Eren is agreeing with Zeke, but neither of those options seem like something Eren would do. 

About question 2: I don't really have a good answer because i've been confused about this."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DavidRoth9876,"I find it funny how nobody is talking about Eren's ""conversation"" with Armin and Mikasa.

Edit: Also, bearing in mind that Floch seems to have some sort of hard-on for following ""necessary devils"" and is just blindly following Eren, I get the feeling that he's going to be a stubling block of sorts later on, if Eren is actually committed to the whole euthenizing the Eldians plan that is."
DavidRoth9876,cgoodies5,"Yeah, I watched both episodes for the first time today, so my biggest takeaway was how brutal that scene was where Eren was beating the shit out of armin. That hurt me in my core."
DavidRoth9876,yanivbl,"Yeah, that was some Bioshock-level twist regarding Mikasa's Ackerman blood. And it applies to Levi too.   


Eren said that ""Ackermans with awakened powers apparently get sudden headaches. It happens when they old self resists being forced to protect their host"". As far as I know, Mikasa doesn't suffer from a lot of headaches despite her protecting Eren twice a day. Maybe it means that her ""old self"" is aligned with the goal of protecting Eren? I kind of hope so because it's terrible to learn that she was just brainwashed all along.  


Also, I thought that Levi had the same thing for Erwin because him following Erwin didn't make much sense, his whole motivation of ""never regret"" wasn't too solid. But in the end, he did let Erwin die out of sympathy for him which doesn't align with him being programmed."
yanivbl,Cheat_Adil,"There is something I couldn't realize without your comment. 




Have you ever read Isaac Asimov's robot stories? There are three rules of robotics, 1 - a robot can't harm a human being or, throughout inaction, allow human being to come to harm; 2 - robot must follow orders given to it by humans if it doesn't conflict with rule 1; 3 - robot must protect itself if this doesn't conflict with rules 1 and 2


These rules are purposefully ambiguous. What counts as harm to human being? Does psychological harm count? In robot stories - yes, it counts. A robot will lie, disobey humans, or kill itself if this means safety for humans.

There is a story called ""Bicentennial man"" about a robot who wanted to become human. In the end he realized that to be called a human he has to be mortal - same as other humans, so he made irreversible damage to his electronic brain.

""I have chosen between the death of my body and the death of my aspirations and desires, to have let my body live at a cost of a greater death is what would have violated the third law""

What I am saying is that Levi let Erwin die to protect Erwin's aspirations and desires"
DavidRoth9876,_whensmahvel_,"Right? I gotta say I‚Äôm leaning hard on the FUCK EREN side, he‚Äôs being such a disrespectful little condescending douche. 

He‚Äôs forgotten the word sympathy/empathy, his whole objective was just to tell his friends in person ‚Äúactually, I fucking hate you guys and your bitches who aren‚Äôt free‚Äù to the people who‚Äôve shown him the most compassion in his entire life. 

If Eren doesn‚Äôt do an extreme 180, Eren deserves to get stabbed in the dick."
_whensmahvel_,Matt-level99999,I think he did a fake 180 to push armin and mikasa away from him because he‚Äôs planning something
DavidRoth9876,PortlandIsThatWay,"I think that conversation could be one of the most important we have seen this season so far. Eren told Armin that he now shares some of Bertholdt's personality because he ate him. Given how that works, the same could be said for Eren. Based on those rules, Eren holds in some of Grisha's personality, which is basically save Eldia. It would make no sense for Eren, who's had one goal for the past 3 seasons, to switch up and follow Zeke's plan to euthanize the entire race. That sounds like the complete opposite of what Eren wants so there is no way, given all this information, that Eren has gone full genocide mode. This show is full of twists and I think we're just being strung along. Eren is gonna reveal what's up his sleeve and then there's going to be a flashback that will make us all slap our foreheads for not seeing it before or something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cgoodies5,"Eren beating this crap out of armin was hard af to watch. Really confused why he is claiming armin is being manipulated by berthold to go see Annie all the time but he‚Äôs not being manipulated by any of the former titan shifters he‚Äôs eaten? How could he know one way or another? 

Also, really wondering when we will get another historia scene, something with her has to end up mattering"
cgoodies5,ZeDitto,It was so hypocritical that I think Eren is bullshitting Armen and Mikasa for some unseen end.
ZeDitto,cgoodies5,"Hating mikasa for not being ‚Äúfree‚Äù, when it‚Äôs not something she either controlled or knew about is wildly hypocritical. Shouldn‚Äôt he be wanting to help set her free?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xoxloudy,Did Levi fucking die?
xoxloudy,sleeplessorion,I don‚Äôt think they would kill off a main character like that.
sleeplessorion,LemonMan857,"Commander Erwin, Bertholdt, and Sasha would like a word with you."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_3rd_Raichu,"I'm pretty sure eren is just playing along with Zeke to use his powers. The previous beast even says it will completely depend upon the person with founding titan what choice is made. And then eren says he understands why his father did what he did. So he's doing the same playing along with Zeke, killing innocents and getting his comrades killed. 
Plus another thing which doesn't make sense is eren and the attack titan stand for freedom. Taking away the choice to procreate from their entire species doesn't really match the freedom ideal .
I think it makes more sense if eren would use this power to remove the ability to become titans from eldians. That way they still don't have to suffer hate from everyone else, but still doesn't really take away any of their freedom."
The_3rd_Raichu,DemonicLemon02,"It can mean freedom in an extremely twisted way; free from this world, free from anymore pain and suffering hence the use of the word ""euthanasia"". Though your theory does sound more interesting and more plausible."
The_3rd_Raichu,L1uQ,"If he takes away the ability to become titans, then there is no hope left for the Eldians in Marley."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nj_shiningcheese_csy,I vibe with Zeke's ideals of never being born

throwthatstuffaway07,QuitBSing,"That sub feels kinda cringe. I kinda understand because I was depressive and wanted never to be born but now I am better and I am glad I exist.

Antinatalism acts as if there is ONLY suffering after birth and never positive exoeriences and having children is selfish and evil because of that. It would kinda be understandable from the Eldian perspective but generally nah.

This is kinda irrelevant to the sub but I just had a little rant."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lord_mush,FUCK FLOCH
Lord_mush,ZeDitto,I fucking love to hate him. He's such a textbook fascist villain. It's beautiful how evil this dude has become. Love him on screen. He's such a prick.
Lord_mush,jboyXD,"I hate floch but like his character at the same time, since he‚Äôs kinda a villain? From one side I feel extremely bad for him, because he watched probably atleast a hundred comrades get ripped to shreds by rocks and has extreme survivors guilt, which I can kind of see why he turned into such a piece. But at the same time he‚Äôs definitely a pretty unstable, pretty bad person"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nariz1234,"Wow this is one of the most uncomfortable episodes I've watched lol, amazing stuff, but I can't believe the season is ending here of all places."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FreddyFahad,"I still can't decide if Zeke is really the Good or the Bad person , and that's why AOT is the Best storyline I've ever seen"
FreddyFahad,marina_kos,I can't sympathise with him. He seems to take pleasure when he causes pain and death.
marina_kos,FreddyFahad,I cannot forget when he butchered the scouts....
marina_kos,RagingSensei,I think his ‚Äòenjoyment‚Äô is actually a coping mechanism to do difficult things like killing. He treats it as a game like baseball as to not be overwhelmed with the reality of his actions
FreddyFahad,matthieuC,It depends if you think the eldian gene is a disease.
FreddyFahad,Hamstirly,"Bruh what

Sterilization is a war crime"
FreddyFahad,OOM-32,"I think everyone in the freaking show thinks its on the good side and that is what makes it amazing.

Except Reiner ofc that just wants to die. But hey he just needs to understand the og plan from Zeke and I'd bet he'll be 100% on board."
FreddyFahad,DapperDaveW,"A few episodes into season 4, I started thinking - it sounds awful, but if the Eldians just quietly disappeared as a race it would solve all these problems.  Maybe they could just not have kids to achieve that."
FreddyFahad,justaverage00,"even if you want to say his goals are good, the ends do not justify the means. Zeke has killed hundreds of Eldians in his attempt to save the Eldians"
FreddyFahad,firestorm64,Bad guy. Genocide is bad. The only reason the Eldians turn into titans is because crazy fuckers keep injecting them with spinal fluid. How about they just stop doing that and let everyone live in peace.
FreddyFahad,Kuhlayre,That's why I love this show. There's no Good guys or Bad guys in the traditional sense. There's people that have been conditioned to their beliefs by their surroundings and it's so cool to have a show with a grey area!
FreddyFahad,PM_ME_RIDER_HENTAI,"Neither to be honest, he's just doing what he feels is necessary to secure a safe future."
FreddyFahad,arrivillaga,It depends on whether you think it's good or bad to kill yourself so that at least your enemy can live in peace.
FreddyFahad,DaveInLondon89,"He's a good bad-person.

Or a bad good-person?"
FreddyFahad,idea-man,"This is such a weird response to me. The dude killed hundreds of innocent people and smiled as he did it. His stated purpose is a ""merciful"" genocide. Even if his bad childhood makes him more sympathetic, the scale of good to bad is tipped so overwhelmingly in one direction. It's crazy the effect that a few humanizing details can have on people's perception of abjectly awful characters."
FreddyFahad,HLayton,"Bad. Like man, there's zero ambiguity there. He has shown a complete disregard for eldian life and as a consequence of his own experiences wants to commit genocide on an entire race of people. He's as evil as you're going to get."
FreddyFahad,zone-zone,A plan that involves genocide makes it pretty clear that he is a very bad person
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eduardsprue,"Eren is probably preparing to die. So he wants to distance his friends so they are not sad, when he does. That was the reason behind his behavior."
eduardsprue,rub_a_dub_ducky,"I think Eren might try to collect all of the Nine Titans, use Historia to access the Founding Titan power to alter all Eldians so that they can‚Äôt transform, and then commit suicide, thus ending Ymir‚Äôs curse and ending the cycle of Eldian suffering. So every Eldian will have the freedom to do with their lives whatever they want without being persecuted."
rub_a_dub_ducky,nastycamel,"I think this too but it doesn‚Äôt solve the problem of humanity against Eldia, it leaves them helpless."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirUlrichVonLichten," 

* Well  the conversation between Eren, Armin, and Mikasa was so heartbreaking  and tough to watch. Just all the things Eren was saying to each of them.  So cold. Part of me wonders if he really meant, or if there is some  other long con going on here? Or at the very least it was harder for him  to say then he let on. But to be honest, it didn't seem that hard.  Eren....he's just completely gone now. I love his transformation, but  god damn is it heartbreaking.
* I loved seeing Armin fight back though.
* ""We've never fought before have we? It's because it's not even a close fight!"" What a brutal moment.
* Levi  being forced to take out all his comrades. so brutal...yet still  badass. Levi is now 3-0 against Zeke. Even if the second fight was  staged. Something about watching Levi beat the shit out of Zeke.
* The  scene where the Jaegerists force the cadets to beat up the old Scout  trainer. Is there a better scene that encapsulates how far and how  different AoT is now? Back in season one, things were so much more  innocent(relatively speaking). Something like that would never have  happened back then. It was a great way to show how far gone things are. I  just love how this show constantly makes you re-examine the way things  use to be.
* So  glad we learned more about Zeke's backstory and his motivations. And  now we've gotten a bigger picture into what Zeke and Eren are planning.  Holy shit man."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DemonicLemon02,Wow they love making it look like Levi is getting blown up for the cliff hanger
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,marina_kos,If Zeke and Eren's plan is to use the founding titans abilities to sterilise every eldian why didn't they do it in Liberio? Do they have to be in paradise?
marina_kos,fist_my_muff2,"Why didn't the subtitles say sterilization? Euthanasia implies they were just going to kill every Eldian, not sterilize."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GutsyEddy,"Zeke had a rough and neglectful childhood. The fatherly love he deserved from Grisha he received from Ksaver, who also looked at Zeke as his lost son. Heart warming bond they had, it was lovely to see Ksaver pass on his Titan with a smile on his face. 

I understand now why Zeke betrayed his parents and his plan of Euthanising Eldians. Although I don‚Äôt think Eren shares the same intentions. He says he does yet he also wishes to fight, survive and save Mikasa and Armin. This contradicts Zeke‚Äôs plan and his actions don‚Äôt exactly line up with ending Eldia. I‚Äôve grown to really like Zeke, especially after this episode so I hope Eren doesn‚Äôt betray him."

makekylecanonagain,MrKaru,He's also the one who introduced Grisha to the restorationists to begin with. And then he becomes the titan that ate Thomas way back in Trost. He's weirdly important for a background character.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spirelord,"Reiner's ""I hate my life"" and Zeke's ""I hate my life"" are two very distinctly different flavors of misery.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,it_is_whatitiz,"Question, do they plan to euthanise everyone or sterilise everyone, because it might just be my subs sucking"
it_is_whatitiz,marina_kos,"From what I understood they want to make all eldians unable to have kids, so sterilise."
marina_kos,it_is_whatitiz,Well i am asking because my subtitles said euthanise and I got really confused given zeke and the former beast titan's conversation. The subtitles probably suck.
marina_kos,Zackdobre,"In my understanding, yes, the plan is to sterilise every eldians. But in someway, this is to Euthanase the Eldian race as a whole (you know, killing the race without suffering, something like that).

So in resume, to euthanise the Eldian race by sterilising each eldian individual, if that makes sense?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Peowulf,"I used to think the show wanted to say something about control and protectionism against outside unknown forces and the like.

But this episode did something very specific to me, during a scene in two parts. It's about the story that both his grandfather and his father read to Zeke. These are two completely opposing stories regarding the same incident and both are considered history by the people that believe each side. Credible, objective and factual history. And that goes for knowledge in general.

And then large groups of people take two polar opposite narratives for granted, they create friends and enemies. The power but also the danger of this dichotomy lies in the fact that the stories believed by each side are black and white. The fact that there is no grey, leaves no room for compromise and trust and also deepens the animosity. This is also very very true in real life, in countries' and nations' relations but also in the relations between smaller groups of civilians.

After all this, of course the ones that are damaged the most are the future generations, the children that are born into communities of hatred against the opposing side.  


And all that is just from  a ""chinese cartoon for kids you weeb"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,loveholic_99,so flock and the yeagerist blindly support zeke's plan for them to go extent? flock really played himself lol
loveholic_99,realkin1112,"Well we don't really know if flock knows about the euthanasia plan, all we know that he full heartedly follows eren"
loveholic_99,Jack1066,"I dont think Floch knows at all, the jaegerists want the new Eldian empire, and I dont think sterilisation would help the empire's longevity"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Former_Sea,"Here‚Äôs my take on this episode. Zeke is a traumatized kid because of bad parents. Same old story which makes sense. Due to trauma and two sided propaganda dude just believes erasing Eldians by preventing them from reproducing will solve the problem of Eldians. Well that‚Äôs good and all that but here‚Äôs my personal feelings. 

That‚Äôs a LAZY solution to such a problem. Just like we **don‚Äôt** say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs kill every women because they will be eventually sexually assaulted at some point in their lives and killing them while they are babies will save them from that pain.‚Äù Or just like when we **dont** say ‚ÄúWe should kill all the black people because they are suffering unimaginable amounts of racism and only killing them will stop it‚Äù. We also shouldn‚Äôt be okay with ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs kill Eldian race by murdering their mojo‚Äù. Because that‚Äôs not a solution at all. In contrary this kind of a goal is working in favor of powers which are currently causing the suffering of Eldians. There is a cause and effect here. You prevent the effect by getting rid of the cause, not the effect itself."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"I for one think Eren is intentionally saying lies and contradiction his past action in that scene where he fights Armin and makes Mikasa cry. 

His entire speech is riddled with contradictions. He calls Armin a slave but he has the founding Titan which is the ultimate slaver of anyone‚Äôs will. Dude has memories of three lines of Titan shifters and has the audacity to call Armin a slave? 

He says Mikasa will always be compelled to protect him but in season 1, Eren insulted Armin and Mikasa punched him in the face. In season 3, Eren told Mikasa how much she meant to him and said he would wrap that scarf around her as many times as he would have too. 

When Armin was about to die, Eren cried in front of Levi to tell him how much Armin wanted to see the world and how if anyone would save the world it would  be Armin. 

When Eren tells Armin they never fought because they both understood the skill gap between them, he wants Armin to take that as a hint that he‚Äôs bluffing big time. Those tow never fought not because the fight would be unfair but because they‚Äôre best friends and love each other. 

Eren knows Armin is smart and will figure out all of these contradictions and eventually Mikasa will tok after they‚Äôve both calmed down. 

Someone also pointed out to me that Eren saying the fight between them isn‚Äôt fair is a hint for Armin to go colossal next time they have to brawl in order to close the skill gap. 

Anyways Eren has been lying straight up throughout this entire scene and this is my take as to why."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoosySucker69,"Eren is the advocate of freedom so its understandable that he's going for the greatest notion of freedom , the freedom from suffering. Life is a suffering especially if you are an Eldian. This is a real philosophical standpoint and although this episode didn't progress much of the story, it really sorted out the philosophy of Eren and Zeke and their radicalism which is pretty agressive but seeing what they have suffered this is self-explanatory. Also it shows that you can't really chose a side in this anime. At this point you can't even enjoy this but just live through it.

The Greatest show of all time. PERIOD

P.S.:- The subtitles are wrong, its sterilise not EUTHANIZE"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Student1838,Did anyone else see the zeke‚Äôs beast titans lower jaw move after Levi blew him up. I rly thought zeke made a body double
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jznaveed,"Believe it or not, I think they fixed Mikasa. Her constant obsession over Eren seemed like her only character trait and really halted any character development from [her.It](https://her.It) made her downright unbearable sometimes.  Now we know that this is biological and there is nothing she can do about it. Really makes her a more interesting character."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GladiatorMainOP,"Damn, Levi really just killed 27 titans at once. Then took down 3 more and one was a titan shifter."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TimeTravelingYams,I have no idea who or what I‚Äôm rooting for... This show is awesome lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aglio99,"- why didn‚Äôt they touch each other in Liberio?

- why euthanasia? Isn‚Äôt it sterilization? 

- why would they want to sterilize eldians? Why should they decide the fate of million people?

- so Zeke and Eren just want to sterilize every eldian and activate the rumbling so they will be finally left alone by all the other nations? And they have to touch each other in order to do that?

- Historia: what is her role?

- what about zeke‚Äôs glasses?

- what does it mean that the ape titan is useless in battle?

- can‚Äôt they just tell their plan to the other guys and stop killing?"
aglio99,loveholic_99,zeke's glasses are the same ones tom xavier had.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,onigiri_dorkk,"Man, so much in these episodes. 

* Poor Mikasa and Armin. They love Eren so much and to see and hear him tell Mikasa that he's always hated her, then have Eren mess up Armin... So sad. There's some debate about Eren having a tear in his eyes in that last scene, but it could just be reflection. Maybe I'm hoping it was a tear :(
* I wonder if what Eren said about the Ackerman's simply locking onto protecting someone is true. I need to rewatch that scene. I think if it is true that that was truly what led Mikasa to protect Eren, I also don't think it necessarily would invalidate her feelings and love for him.
* Y'all... I hate Floch. I think I dislike him more than any character on the show.
* Also, KEITH!!! I don't know if he died?!!?!? But if he did what a tragic way for him to go -- his story revolves around constantly being proven he's not good or 'special' enough, and here comes Floch completely undermining his leadership/that under Eren and Jaegerists is better than his leadership, and making all of Keith's cadets turn on him. 
* Zeke's backstory was painful. Feels kinda raw and real to what children of any extremism can go through. Those scenes of him being torn apart by Grisha's disapproval and disappointment was too freakin real 
* LEVI. Oh my GOD. So much loss. He already feels like he's bearing the weight of his choices saving Eren and helping him become who he turned out to be... And to top it off, he said yes to his cadets to bring that wine along. Yet another heavy loss that he feels is his fault. Just wanna hug him.
* OK BUT ALSO I was SCREAMING at Levi to just kill Zeke. I know the Beast should get passed down strategically but GOD I was over it hahaha 
* LEVI BETTER NOT BE DEAD, but also I don't think he is???? I truly think if a character as main and powerful as Levi gets killed, he will get a grand and epic death and farewell. But maybe not... Idk, you never know with Isayama haha

Ok I'm done. FML it just feels SOOOOOOO heavy! The episode ended and I'm here on Reddit trying to find consolation lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,InterestingClass4254,Fuck I really hope that Eren is actually on board with Zekes plan and isn‚Äôt manipulating him like everyone else in his life otherwise I‚Äôd literally cry. Knowing Eren he more than likely is the one manipulating Zeke. Poor kid has ptsd
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meanteenbirder,Just noticed that they gave Zeke pants in the scene after he eats Ksaver in a change from the manga.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,botbuabm,"Gabi's looking real quiet after all that ""I'll kill eren"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vunacar,"Grisha is easily the most (unintentionally?) evil character on the show. Killed the whole Reiss family including Frieda to get the Founding Titan. Treated Zeke like a tool to achieve his own goal to restore Eldia which enslaved humans for 1700 years. Turned Eren into a titan against Eren's consent.

He is the only character on the show that is presented with no redeemable qualities."
vunacar,SuperMoonSensei,"Unpopular opinion, but idk that he's evil. A common theme in the series is how the perception of who's good/bad or right/wrong depends on the perspective and background you've been given up until that point. That's one of the reasons a lot of people are empathizing more with Zeke after the last episode.

The fact still remains though that the world has demonized the Eldians, and the only obvious way to free them from that persecution is to rise up against Marley. Tbh I'm not even sure the rest of the world hates the Eldians like the Marleyans do. Like when Marley gathered the rest of the nation before the declaration of war? Seemed to me they were trying to convince and be sure that the rest of the world would side with them in the conflict.

What if Grisha was right about wanting Eren to be the savior of the Eldians? I'd say the big question is whether or not Eren's will is gonna waver. The Jaegerists are behind Eren because they believe him to be the only one capable of making the tough decision to wage war with Marley despite the fact that there will be a lot of collateral damage/death. A season/few episodes ago, Eren was definitely that guy. Inheriting the titans and all of their memories though... can he still go through with it?"
vunacar,Lapystaja,Nah Grisha was a good man perhaps not a good father but a good man despite that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Less_Grapefruit_6503,"I‚Äôm still shocked at how Grisha was able to be a normal parent to Eren, but was an awful father ruled my his trauma with Zeke. Does it have something to so with the wisdom of Eren Kruger or was it because he simply couldn‚Äôt indoctrinate Eren in the same way?"
Less_Grapefruit_6503,AnselLovesNuts,Also worth nothing Eren‚Äôs mom was raising Eren as a normal kid with no titan past unlikr Dina Fritz who also added pressure onto Zeke.
Less_Grapefruit_6503,ZeDitto,I think Grisha did legitimately forget some things after he became a titan. He probably wasn't so fixated on the death of his sister. Also he realized how much of a crap father he was to Zeke after he was turned in to the Marleyans. I think his hindsight helped him to be a better father.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iLerntMyLesson,This show really knows how to work the audiences emotions. One episode you hate a character and the next you feel bad for him. Classic AoT.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flappydicks,"That fight between Eren and Armin was heartbreaking. And Mikasa not being able to stand up to Eren was a huge plot twist. On top of that Eren claiming to hate Mikasa was just a slap to the face. 

Like holy shit I feel soooo bad for Mikasa but Armin didn‚Äôt deserve that. I yelled ‚ÄúTHOSE ARE YOUR BEST FRIENDS!!!‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JGuilherme02,I can say with one hundred percent certainty that eren was lying to zeke about the mass euthanasia plan. He is the one manipulating zeke. I also have a hard time believing eren hates mikasa
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"I have a concern/question... so Eren just told Mikasa that she‚Äôs basically designed to protect the king/royal family... if that‚Äôs the case, then how can Levi be hurting Zeke?  All I can assume is that he is lying."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,romanNood1es,I actually feel bad for Zeke losing his glasses.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stolenrobotgorilla,"I see why people are falling for Zeke but he did kill ALOT of scouts and other innocent people, just because he looks cute when he was a kid and had a shitty father isn't an excuse. He's a smart guy and could've found a better way than massacre, Levi was not wrong at all."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SnooGrapes7659,What was Levi‚Äôs reason to not kill Zeke? Isn‚Äôt he too much powerful to handle now that he knows that he can trigger officials to become titans. I get that Zeke‚Äôs beast titan needs to be transferred to someone but I still believe that the risk is too high anyway
SnooGrapes7659,Elbeautz,I think levis plan was ‚Äúif i keep slicing the bitch up he will never have a chance to transform‚Äù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Icarus8798,"Anyone notice how Armin was the first to start using violence in the conversation with Mikasa and Eren? In S1 he said that resorting to violence in an argument is proof of being wrong and Im pretty sure this was the first time he resorted to violence instead of talking first. 

I also do believe Eren hates Mikasa. He was always cold to her when she would say how much she wanted to protect him and it would explain why he attacked her in S1 when he transformed into a titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,percyveil8,I am a little late to the party but one of Zeke‚Äôs greatest strengths as the beast was his throwing ability which he got from playing catch with his replacement dad...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dracob2099,I hope Reiner will be our savior
DrHikigaya,TheComplexKid,Part 2?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Less_Grapefruit_6503,"This episode fucked me up omg. The fact that Zeke‚Äôs childhood and life were so awful that he decided that no Eldian should ever have kids again is so sad. And the man he saw as a father wished he was never born. Plus all of the anguish he had to experience through his titan memories. I‚Äôm so glad they explained why Zeke can murder 100s of Eldians and feel no remorse. Anyways I love Zeke, he‚Äôs in my top 5 favorite characters üò≠"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fourlokoseltzers,"1. If daddy Levi is not ok ... I will be calling out of work for death in the family
2. Yeah grisha seems like a pos but honestly he wasn‚Äôt saying anything terrible. It was trying to influence his son to do shit he didn‚Äôt wanna do which was. We can see though he grew up and knew he was wrong to do so which he brings up in the episode he talks about his past when eren first goes in the basement. 
3. Eren def better be plotting in his brain to take over zeke and love Mikasa ok"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Foren,If the Found Titan can change the biology of eldians is it possible to remove/prevent the curse of ymir?? Eren might have something up his sleeve and it might just be that if it's even possible. but holy shit my boy levi better not be dead
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,illumantimess,"All that hate that is directed at Gabi really should be going to Zeke who massacred our beloved scouts and Erwin in a cruel way. Grisha was bad to him and he is a complicated character, but Zeke is still irredeemable in my eyes after the atrocities he committed"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zanoske00,Eren breaking down Mikasa was fucking brutal
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaseus4578,"Iseyama is still alive, so rest-assured Levi is alive too.  
Zeke had a rough childhood and all, but his plan makes has little sense and isn't a real solution. It's literally suicide, and he's forcing his bs suicidal plan on others.   
Eren is clearly lying out of his ass. He deeply cares for Mikamin. I believe he did all that to make mikasa and armin realise what was actually going on; he wanted armin to not get unduly influenced by his memories, and for mikasa to not care for him solely due to her DNA. But yeah his outburst was unnecessarily rude and cruel.  
Given that eren has always yearned for true freedom, there's no way in hell that he has actually agreed to Zeke's plan. The best course of action for saving my fave eldian demons now would be to destroy Marley and then call onto other countries to join Paradis or get destroyed, to prevent outright genocide of every non-paradis/non-eldian. Afterwards a treaty and an organisation like the UN.  
Lastly, we can all empathize with and understand the reasoning behind the actions of all the characters ( hate Zeke but get where he's coming from). Except Floch. Fuck Floch."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5yk0515,"So, how much of the alleged Eldian atrocities are real, and how much are fake news by the Marleyans?

Like today's episode had Grisha tell Zeke that at least three of the atrocities supposedly committed by Eldians in the past never actually happened.

Perhaps the Eldians did commit atrocities in the past, but perhaps some of those were exaggerated or fabricated by the Marleyans.

As we know, history is written by the victors (Marleyans in this case)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,Why tf didn't they just put their plan into action when they were together? Why not just touch Zeke right there and rewrite the bodies of the Eldians in that moment?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lazy_rocky,I love how zeke was like ah shit here we go again
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shaft_king,Episode ended with a bang.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Throw23349874,"I really didn‚Äôt want to like Zeke but they did an annoying good job fleshing his backstory out and explaining his motives. I kind of get where he‚Äôs coming from but wiping out his own race is definitely not the way. 

I also still don‚Äôt know what Eren‚Äôs thinking but it seems like he‚Äôs pretending to go along with Zeke for the time being. I‚Äôm also certain that isn‚Äôt the plan he‚Äôs pitching his followers or else his support would dry up fast."

which means Eldians without even being Titans can access memories of other past dead eldians... or the founding Titan was doing something at that time that exposed those memories to Eren .. ?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,happycatsadcat,So hypothetical question: if they were to do the whole euthanasia thing what would happen to someone who‚Äôs pregnant like historia. Would the baby just die?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LigmaNutz69420,I wanna see the goddamn rumbling happen. That shit sounds sick.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kayseriously,Was it just me or did anyone else find the CGI on Zeke's Beast form a bit too much? Monke was in 3D constantly
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mopolopol,Yoo look behind Yelena in the aftercredits. Feelssadman
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YaboiGh0styy,"Episode 14 was brutal Eren hating Mikasa because she‚Äôs a slave and then beating Armin was hard to watch even if I knew it was coming because spoilers. Also the rematch with Levi and Zeke was awesome even if 3D monke didn‚Äôt look good. And then the Yeagerists just go ahead and have the 109th cadets beat Kieth possibly to death. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough we have Zeke get tortured by Levi in a scene which I‚Äôm surprised was able to air on television you got Zeke with the thunder spear in the side and exposed wounds all over his body. 

Zeke‚Äôs backstory was really sad do you just wanted to have a childhood but Grisha was a pretty shit father and yes I know he wants revenge for his sister and his aunt after he heard she was eaten alive by dogs that doesn‚Äôt excuse what he did to Zeke and honestly I don‚Äôt blame Zeke for doing what he did. The closest thing he had to a father was the previous beast titan Tom Ksaver and all they did was talk and play catch just goes to show how badly he was treated by Grisha then at least his father isn‚Äôt Rodd Riess. Zeke also shows just how much he cares about Eren in this episode despite knowing nothing about him other than he is his half brother he goes to paradis to save him from Grisha. even though he didn‚Äôt need saving. He also gives Eren Tom‚Äôs baseball which was really nice seven giving Zeke some much needed character development. And Zeke isn‚Äôt dead they wouldn‚Äôt kill of a major character like that plus if he‚Äôs dead it would mean Eren would fight against the Titans alone (this is in a spoiler it‚Äôs pretty obvious it‚Äôs gonna happen in Pieck wouldn‚Äôt invade Paradis alone) which I really hope isn‚Äôt the case because I want to see the brothers fighting side-by-side."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PruneJelly,"All important characters in this show either have dead parents, trash parents, or unknown parents"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wolfpac187,"This show is elite.

I've been waiting for Eren to sit down and talk with Armin and Mikasa and it didn't disappoint at all. I think there's a possibility that Eren didn't mean what he said to Mikasa and only did it to seperate them from himself, but at the same time he's permanently ruined his relationship with his old friends. And watching poor Armin catch those hands was wild.

Levi is the GOAT but at this point he's made Zeke his bitch. He's bodied Zeke twice and I feel like when they fight for the third time it's gonna be Zeke's turn to get a W, and I don't think he's gonna keep Levi alive sadly. Besides that I was hype to see Zeke finally die.

Floch is trash and is in my top three most hated along with Rod Reiss and that dude that killed Grisha's sister and turned Dina into a Titan (forgot his name).

Yeah I wasn't hype to see Zeke die after ""Sole Salvation"" I don't think I've ever changed my mind about a character so quickly. He's done some of the most horrible shit in the show but at the same time seeing what his parents put him through was honestly disgusting. By the end I was hoping Levi wouldn't kill him.

I don't fully understand Zeke's plan of wiping out Eldians and why Eren is going along with it but maybe he's not and he's just waiting to turn on Zeke. Makes sense considering how happy Zeke was when Eren teamed up with him since Eren is loving breaking peoples hearts lately.

Before these episodes I've predicted that Eren will die by either Mikasa or Levi's hands but now I don't think Mikasa is even capable and I don't see Levi making it that far. I think it'll be Reiner or Gabi."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mveer99,"Just finished watching the episodes, and guys, maybe it's just me but <theorizing, so, might be a spoiler if correct..> I think with Mikasa taking the scarf off, and the whole Armin-Eren fight sequence, that these two will be the ones that will(might) eventually (have to) finish/kill Eren!   
If this really ends up happening, this was the perfect time to get their relationship sorted, what an amazing episode this!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sol_Lucifer,"AOT can't possibly end on season 4 episode 16. And yeah this isn't a spoiler or something, I haven't read the manga. But even without reading the manga I can tell there is no way they can put a proper end to the series in one episode front the point it left on episode 15. So does anyone know if there will be a part 2 or a movie or something after season 4?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Revolutionary_Edge31,It's so sad that their plan this whole time was to end Eldians man. Also I pray Levi is okay man wtf was that
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stonkmastr347,Poor monke
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Throw23349874,At this point I‚Äôm almost convinced Levi could have exterminated all the Titans himself but held back out of respect for the poor fellas.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jaralex,"Damn, can't believe Eren's just gonna make it so that all the Eldians have erectile dysfunction. Fucked up"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I_am_Feli,"When I watched the episode 14 I was leaning more towards Levi‚Äòs side because of how easy it seemed for Zeke to commit such crimes and murders but after this flashback in episode 15 I genuinely started crying tears when I saw how Levi was torturing  Zeke in the rain like that. I genuinely felt so so bad for him because I never truly believed he was evil to begin with, I was just waiting for the story to reveal his actual ideals so I had sympathy for Zeke yet I also obviously understood Levi‚Äòs standpoint. 

The further this season progresses the more I feel detached from our scouts and closer to Eren and Zeke. I trust in Eren and I think people really don‚Äôt give him enough credit this man is smarter than y‚Äôall think he knows d has experienced things beyond anybody‚Äôs imagination. Hanji and Armin on the other hand just can‚Äôt let go of their morals and beliefs and hopes for some kind of change in the greater scheme of things. Hoping everyone can become friends again but in that they are limiting themselves and causing more damage in the long run. 

They simply are not ready to make the sacrifices that Eren is preparing himself to make in order to end this cycle and progress. 

I do feel bad for them because Eren is not giving them any answers or hints that he still is the same person they grew up with. 

Anyway I don‚Äôt know how Eren is going to solve all of this because I really hope he is not going to kill off all Eldians but find some kind of loop hole to make everyone survive in sone shape or form. Historian is still pregnant and I can‚Äôt help but feel like that might be Eren‚Äòs doing and this future child is going to play a major role in how this show is going to end so I am looking forward to finding out how."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CowboyBebopCrew,"Wait‚Ä¶ just to make sure I‚Äôm getting this correct‚Ä¶ Eren and Zeke want to change Eldian biology so they can‚Äôt procreate and perpetuate the Titans over time? Are they wanting to basically make all Eldians infertile/sterile or just certain ones? 

If so, I guess I get how this would make Eldians less of a threat, but I don‚Äôt think the world would instantly treat them nicely given the recent events. But, I could be wrong."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedxHarlow,"Levi is my favorite character, however, Levi is a fucking idiot."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sikemeay,I feel weird about how there‚Äôs only one episode left and we understand Zeke‚Äôs motivations now more than we understand Eren‚Äôs. I feel serious whiplash that Eren‚Äôs character changed so much offscreen that he is willing to turn on his friends so heartlessly like that.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RoseL123,"Question: 

What exactly is Zeke‚Äôs plan? When he first mentions it, it sounds like he wants to sterilize all Eldians so they die off after a few generations, but then every time he refers to it after that point he says ‚Äòeuthanasia,‚Äô which would imply outright killing all Eldians."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chlmiguelit0,"Eren really said: ""Hey this Anakin Skywalker guy is really cool"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FreddieB_13,"This show has really ascended to the pantheon of the greats with this season.

Anyway, I don't see this having a happy ending."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TJNimNums,"I don't buy it. I don't think Eren agrees with Zeke's euthanization plan, it just goes against his whole character since season 1. I think he has some kind of secret \*secret\* plan and he just needed Zeke's cooperation for it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kamislick,So how do y'all feel about Eren??? I'm riding with him the whole way
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ARMOUREDZOMBIE,Y‚Äôall see that correlation between Zeke having a killer baseball throw to him slaughtering scouts as the Beast Titan with rocks right?
ARMOUREDZOMBIE,hushzone,"No I must have missed that incredibly subtle detail. 

They should've made it more obvious by having Zeke throw the rocks like a baseball pitcher and talk about baseball while throwing the rocks. 

It all went over my head"
hushzone,ARMOUREDZOMBIE,"Hahaha oh man you sound like a fun guy, sorry for being such a piece of shit! That‚Äôs my bad lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"When you love your race and the world so much you decide to get 2 birds with 1 stone and end your entire race thereby saving your race and the world.

But also couldn‚Äôt Zeke and eren just change eldians so that they can‚Äôt become titans anymore, then their just regular people. Or they could change the physic of eldians to be the same as Marleyan, making it so they can‚Äôt be identified by whatever tests Marley does to distinguish them. It just seems that‚Äôs theirs 1000 other ways to do this but Zeke and eren just really don‚Äôt want to be bad dads like their dad."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,masterstealth11,"Honestly it‚Äôs not a bad plan. Keeping Eldians from being able to have kids isn‚Äôt that cruel. Killing them outright is, but I see how the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm saving the children they would have had‚Äù mentality might have been what made Zeke and Eren ok with it
Still, I think Eren and Zeke have different true intentions. What Eren‚Äôs true intentions are.... who knows
Amazing as always"
masterstealth11,AnselLovesNuts,I agree about them having different plans. Eren‚Äôs ability to see the past of the Founding Titan might give him the edge over Zeke‚Äôs plan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JohnArtemus,"Honestly.  I don't think I have ever been as emotionally drained from watching a TV show as I am with AoT.  These two were episodes were just devastating.  In a span of two episodes Eren has become more hated than Gabi, in my book, for what he did to Mikasa.  That was quite honestly very difficult for me to watch.

You could see the moment her heart breaks.  It was just...awful.

I want Eren dead now.

Or so I thought.  Until I watched Sole Salvation. Now, I'm not so sure.  They want to eliminate Titans forever and ""free"" the Eldian people.  But Eldian Euthanasia sounds a little bit too close to The Final Solution.  I'm sure that's intentional with the parallels to Jewish ghettos and whatnot.

I don't see how this is going to be wrapped up by next week.  If Zeke is truly dead, as it was implied, then we are headed to a final showdown with Levi and Eren.  Assuming Levi survived that blast.

Wouldn't be surprised if Armin is the one that gets Eren at the end."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chungulungus,"I'm kinda confused. So does Zeke and Eren want Eldians to go extinct by getting rid of the ability to have kids so no one has to worry anymore? Like you're not really freeing Eldia, you're literally making them go extinct. Can someone explain it to me please because I feel like that's a terrible plan lol"
Chungulungus,formantzero,"I think you're basically right. It's called ""anti-natalism"" in philosophy. One general argument I've heard goes about like this: 

> By virtue of being born, a person will encounter suffering. If you seek to minimize harm and suffering, you should not make a decision to have children because you are guaranteeing they will suffer.

I think this is obviously a putrid way to view the world, and I don't think we're necessarily supposed to sympathize with this viewpoint. Although, it seems like the situation in Eldia has some complexities since Eren said that basically none of them have free will. Still, anti-natalism often ignores positive aspects of being alive, and who knows if they may be able to win free will as Eldians instead of choosing auto-genocide by psychic castration."
Chungulungus,dogenroll,"You explained it yourself. Zeke is so traumatized from his upbringing that he feels the only way to save Eldians from a ""cruel"" world is if they are never born at all. If you're not born, you can't experience cruelty, because you simply don't exist. 

I also think this is not the right path to take, and I don't think Eren actually agrees with Zeke, because Eren has always been about freedom. Taking away the ability to procreate means he's taking away people's freedom of choice. So Eren might actually just be using Zeke for his own plans."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LetgomyEkko,"Bruh, what if Erin's true plan is to make EVERYONE Eldian?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditer51,"Naruto: ..But we're gonna get Eren back, right guys?!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditer51,"Episode 15

Me (before watching): Oh great. A flashback episode...

Me (after watching): Never mind, this was really crucial. Never thought I would actually sympathize with Zeke a little. Like, I can see why he did what he did. And that doctors family...my God.

Also, Eren's dad wasn't the best father but I'm outright shocked at how abusive he was.

And if there's one thing these two episodes have shown....its that Eren is gone. That hot-headed, heroic kid we've been following for close to a decade is dead. He wants to essentially drive his own race extinct, he's become a terrorist leader, and he's completely and utterly turned against Armin and Mikasa in the cruelest way possible. The same kid who saved Mikasa from human traffickers is now telling her her life is worthless. The same kid who defended Armin from bullies is now beating him to the ground in a show of dominance and spite.

Maybe he doesn't really mean it. Maybe its all an act. But then again, maybe it isn't."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UsuallyParrot,"I think Eren‚Äôs real plan is to consume all of the Titans, including Armin and Zeke, and someone eradicate the Titans by destroying himself, or containing the power. I can‚Äôt really think of why he attacked Marley outright, solo, other than to try and consume more Titans powers.

I think the key part of the mystery still left is how historia and her pregnancy factors in to the puzzle. I assume Eren has some role in that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ddb996,Did anyone else feel like Eren was being extra mean and cruel to Mikasa and Armin on purpose?  It really feels to me like he's trying to push them away do that they don't get caught up with whatever his true plans really are.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,throwawayr3lation,Can someone explain to me like I‚Äôm 5 what Zeke and Erens plan is? I feel like I‚Äôm so dumb watching this
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,techyme008,"I feel Eren is just saving Mikasa & Armin by becoming the culprit, As owl said to grisha you have to save Mikasa & Armin so it's something predecessor Attack Titan holder conveying him?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EdleRitter,I'm pretty sure I would rather see Mikasa die than Eren humiliate her like that. What a punch in the gut.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StudMuffin9980,Would Zeke's plan affect Ackermans? We're told the Founding can't change their memories.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,civ_gandhi,"what both brothers don't realize that technology will soon overtake the Titan power and anyone with technological strength will then dominate the world and will continue the cycle of hatred 

Also Marley did all the propaganda and yet used Titan powers exactly like the previous Titan rulers themselves. 

Power can change hands, but the wielder (no matter who) will always rule with brute strength 

If Eldians are wiped out, other countries with military might will try to dominate the world. A new devil country will emerge... LOL 

This series is brilliant"
civ_gandhi,realkin1112,"that is true, but in the present, there is nothing really that can stop the colossal titans in the walls. weapons they have in present aot universe is no where near to defeat the clossals i guess"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noctiszaoldyeck,"Annie, Reiner, bertoldt and the other looks cute as a kid.  i loved that cameo"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,civ_gandhi,can the founding Titan bring pure Titans back to human form?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hushzone,"Wow. 

I always thought Mikasa as badass as she is is one of the weakest written characters on the show - single mindedly fixated on protecting Eren while he treats her with contempt - I always thought it was one of the more meh parts of the show. 

I can't believe they are actually exploring all of these issues out of nowhere - I always thought I was the only one that saw how dismissive Eren was of her. While I do think Eren is ultimately going to be revealed to be lying in part about what he said about mikasa - I still think it's cool they're going into it. 

I'm still not super sold on the bloodlines part of the mythology - so I'm not super stoked about this ackerman thing - especially since I'm not really seeing how it applies to all ackermans anyway (who is Levi's master or whatever?) still glad they're finally giving mikasa some depth"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,afrojoe5000,Can anyone explain to me how this works? Is there really only 1 episode left? Will there just be a Final Season Part 2? The story can't end in 1 more episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"When we see the Mr. Ksaver playing catch with a teenage Zeke, there is a little sheep doll on his table. Zeke had a little monkey doll in one of the flashback episodes of season 3. 

I‚Äôm thinking Ksaver‚Äôs beast Titan was sheep like in the way that Zeke‚Äôs beast Titan is monke."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lilnutandbolt,I now would love to see an Eren and Levi confrontation and have Eren say the things he said to Mikasa to Levi. Maybe we'll get another classic beatdown and this time I would enjoy it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Heyliluchi02,I really hope if zeke survived he gets his glasses back. This anime has simultaneously made me love and hate every character so much. Except gabi fuck her
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aht116,"Edgelord Eren ""There's no greater salvation than not being born in this world"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Illustrious_Ocelot33,"In Ksavers flashback about his family, you can see a toy ram/sheep in the background, which I feel like indicates that he was a ram titan or some sort, not a monkey titan when he had the titan powers, especially since it‚Äôs called the ‚Äúbeast‚Äù titan, not monkey titan, meaning any ‚Äúbeast‚Äù could be inherited. Also, the opening in season 2 showed all those animals running with Zekes beast titan, which could mean the same thing, don‚Äôt y‚Äôall think?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Positive_Magician_52,"Eren/Zeke: We're gonna end this 2000 year titan reign.

So now I finally understand who said ""To you, 2000 years from now"" line. It was the OG Ymir, when she received the powers or whenever in her lifetime after that. God damn."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SuperScientest1,Man is no one gonna talk about Eren being an absolute monster to the people that have been with him since day one?! Seeing him tell Mikasa that he always hated her and beating up Armin was very difficult to watch.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daisey_92,So proud of my boy armin for trying ü•≤
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cojovoncoolio,"Those damn Jeagers and their daddy issues....despite seeing Zeke and Eren's backstory, it just shows that Marley's brainwashing is far more effective than Eldia's is. At the end of the day, Zeke's plan may take away Marley's greatest weapon, but it also confirms their ""Devil"" narrative for Eldians and takes it to the Fascist extreme. 

&#x200B;

Unless Eren is planning a big ol' backstab switcheroo (which he still may be), I think I've officially stopped supporting the Main Character at this point. Sorry Jeagerists, 8-pack abs isn't enough to sway me to Euthanasia...."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thisiscaboose,"Okay, my theory: Eren doesn't care about Zeke and is just using him as a red herring to do the rumbling. He doesn't want to follow his plan and will keep moving forward. How will he do that? He is going to meet with Historia in Shiganshina and basically spawn kill her baby to create a pure titan that will allow him to do the same thing. That would explain why she suddenly decided to have a child and seemed so depressed about the whole thing. Would fit Historia's character of trying to sacrifice everything, even her firstborn kid. And would also be a nice thematic ""fuck you"" to Zeke who tried to sterilize the Eldian population, to have him get rekt by an Eldian infant."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uglyassvirgin,this show is incredible how in depth it‚Äôs getting with real human emotions dealing with war
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BashfulArtichoke,I'm a little lost on some details. What were Eren and Zeke talking about when they said their dad killed some kids? Don't remember that at all. What exactly is their motivation again? That it was better that Eldians not be born at all or something? Is that really what Eren thinks? I feel like its probably just classic anime misdirection like in Code Geass where it turns out the main character was good all along.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bl4ck0u7,"Is the reward for snitching on your parents a ‚Äúchad-buff‚Äù pill or something? Because zeke proved his loyalty to Marley and all that stuff, still he was the physically weakest candidate, and ended up as a warchief! What did I miss? And why the didn‚Äôt want to touch each other? Trust issues for the big bad evil plan?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,underpants_etc,I wonder how Historia‚Äôs baby is gonna play into this whole sterilization thing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JPastori,During the scene when zeke screamed I could only think of ‚Äúwhen you barely tap your younger sibling and they run to tell mom‚Äù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bobby_corwin,"Is this seriously about to end? Isn't there like, a lot more to get through before it's over? I was expecting the next episode to be a mid-season finale, but is it really the series finale?"
bobby_corwin,gaysaucemage,"They‚Äôre calling this the final season instead of season 4 in marketing. There‚Äôs only 16 confirmed episodes.

Speculation has been for a final season part 2. Hopefully there will be an announcement after next week‚Äôs episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,usvicruiser,"This sterilization plan has a lot of holes in it. Even if they succeed in using the founding titan to sterilize the Eldians, the founding titan and all other special titans would need to be passed on several times in 100 years. So long as there is one person of royal blood alive who is not on board with Zeke‚Äôs plan, the sterilization could be undone. So for it to work, Historia and her child would also have to be killed, and you would need to hope that there are no other Eldians of royal blood out there in the world."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ok-Ask-7718,Isyama is a legend. He makes us sympathize with the characters we want to hate too much.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cheat_Adil,Levi tieing thunder spear around Zeke was as stupid desicion as Zeke thinking titans could stop Levi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Robotik1991,I hope they are not rushing the end and will do a complete season instead of inky one movie.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Big_noob24,What was eren bleeding all over the table for??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Throwaway56138,"Beast titan scene in the woods looked it of place. Bad cgi. When the frame was on beast titans face and he's looking around for Levi. The movement was just so....off... It's sad, because that scene was amazing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,"Eren in Season 1: ""I deserve freedom because I was born into this world!""

Eren in Season 4: ""We should never have been born into this world, not being born is the ultimate salvation."""
DrPikachu-PhD,caramelmac,I don't know how Eren got so depressed after the ending in S3.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hellofriendimwatchng,THE BASEBALL. ERENS CHANGED CUZ OF THE BASEBALL. zeke needed to trust someone who wasnt him with the founding titan. (unless i missread that) so by giving him the baseball it shows his trust. it could break the vow. baseball deff has significance
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shanks1130,"I'm really confused right now. Isn't Zeke's plan just a little extreme version of Marley's plan. Sure Marley doesn't want to exterminate the Eldians, rather exploit their ability to turn into titans. But wouldn't it make more sense if Zeke had stayed with Marley, tried to take the founding titan by force, and proceeded with his plan after that. Moreover, he believes that Eren has been brainwashed by Grisha so why trust Eren in the first place. Or am I missing something here?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joey-airwalker,"This doesn‚Äôt have much to do with the new episode, but can someone explain what are the subjects of Ymir? I don‚Äôt understand it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,queenlilibeth14,Still wondering why Isayama didn‚Äôt show us Levi killing all his Titan comrades one by one lol I want to see more pain and rage in Levi‚Äôs eyes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flyinghippodrago,So that line about Mikasa being a slave because Eren asked her to defend him as a kid is total BS right? He is neither royal or had the founding at that time...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TRUFFELX,So is Shadis dead? Or just incredibly beaten?
TRUFFELX,xellospm,I think they just beat his ass
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Buddhabellyrub,"So I was a little confused by episode 15. Is their plan to use the Founding Titan to change the Eldian's bodies so that they can no longer reproduce, or to just straight up kill all existing Eldians?"
Buddhabellyrub,max1001,Founding Titan can genetically modify all Eldian body remotely.  It's pretty ridiculous but this is AOT.
Buddhabellyrub,hypoch0ndriacs,I got the impression it was no longer reproduce
Buddhabellyrub,rimmyrick,"The plan is to have Eren sterilize all Eldian‚Äôs by using the coordinates abilities, although he must be in contact with Zeke (a royal blood titan) to use the full power of the coordinate. This would euthanize the entire Eldian race within a few generations (hence why they call it euthanasia), as Zeke thinks the only way to end Eldian‚Äôs suffering, is to assure no more Eldian‚Äôs are born."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,molotovinyourbum,recommend me another anime to watch after im done with season 4
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamsploot,Well....fuck Eren. He did Mikasa and Armin dirty. Dudes dead to me.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nico1016,Does the anime really only have one episode left? Don't they have like 30 chapters of the manga to fit into one episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KGun-12,And to think I was worried that the animation would be worse this season with the new studio. Jesus that Levi / Zeke fight.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DyreWild,"I coincidentally watched a video about ""Anti-Natalism"" while binging analysis vids. Seems this is what zeke and ereh are going for."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Elpizo-,"Man, you can actually feel how shocked and devastated Levi was as he says ""kuso/shit"" in a stuttery manner when his squad of 30 turned. Give the man a break. :/"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cmtr2113,Ok so no news about a part 2 or a movie yet. Do you think they‚Äôll announce something tomorrow?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,batfastarddom,"You know what I‚Äôve realised that stuff Eren said to Missaka, it can‚Äôt be true because surely Levi wouldn‚Äôt of been able to kick the shit of eren in season 1?"
batfastarddom,Dappersloth555,I think Levi was implied to be the protector of Erwin while Mikasa imprinted onto Eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zaethex,I'm confused by the scream scene. Every soldier in the forest seem to have transformed besides Levi. Did he not transform because of his blood or does he not drink?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pakomojo,"Why is episode 14 merged with episode 15?
Like, I‚Äôm trying to see a discussion on episode 14 without worrying about e15 spoilers lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thePoet0fTwilight,Repeat after me - ‚ú®fuck Floch‚ú®
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Parker324ce,Why is it not on Crunchyroll yet??? Nearly an hour late
Parker324ce,Elemental_Design,Daylights saving time pushed it an hour.
Parker324ce,daisy_no,HONESTLY.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OOM-32,So Zeke wants world euthanasia. Queue in Reiner helping him lmfao.
OOM-32,Payment-Hour,"No, he wants only eldians sterilization!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,intellectual_ass789,"I felt bad for grisha when i first heard his story, but now when i heard his name in my head comes a picture of somone who's an absolute ashole."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAMMIIRO,Why is the soundtrack on the Levi fight scene so bad??? Good God. Just didn‚Äôt fit. Whoever made that production decision should be fired.
IAMMIIRO,rimmyrick,"Yeah it was super strange imo. I think it was used because it is Kenny‚Äôs theme (used in S3), and they wanted to tie it into Levi somehow. Either way, it sounded kind of odd and out of place."
rimmyrick,IAMMIIRO,ya. bummed me out cause the scene was so sick.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tomatomelee,The beast titan CGI was extra bad this episode :(
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAMMIIRO,Why did they make Mikasa look like a man. I‚Äôm just really frustrated about this.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,throwthatstuffaway07,Hajime Isayama is probably an Antinatalist
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"@ the end of E74: I wonder if Zeke's move here is to count on his ability to survive the blast and regenerate? Levi won't have that option, and he was really close to the blast. Wonder if that's how he goes out.. :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,broskeymchoeskey,Did anyone else notice in the preview for next weeks episode it looks like Mikasa isn‚Äôt wearing her scarf anymore in prison?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,benttwig33,"So, is their going to be a season 4 part 2? Or are they actually wrapping up the entire show like this week or next week? I am a bit out of the loop on when the story will conclude and the anime will be complete. Can anyone share some light on this?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MarthaStewartsMouth,Honestly I don‚Äôt care about their motivations I despise Zeke and Eren.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BizzNeuf,"What if they just, threw all the spinal fluid into the zink and one guy has all the titans, then just wait those 13 years out..or am I missing something? I do faintly remember something if no one possesses the founding titan a random eldian would be born with it?"
BizzNeuf,Mr_Sarcastic12,"Random eldians would receive the titan powers after the 13 years, so that plan doesn't work."
BizzNeuf,Xurban,too complicated and would take too long. the series is almost over and eren still has to be the main character
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dogenroll,"Is nobody gonna talk about how Eren was talking to Mikasa and Armin. It's so fucked, but now that I think about it, Mikasa always pissed Eren off when she tried to constantly protect him, especially in season 1. 

Zeke's backstory is amazing, this added so much more depth to his mysterious character. I genuinely felt bad for him. It's fucked up that all the stuff he went through has led him to the decision that euthanization is the way to go. 

Also, there's no way Eren is ""on board"" with Zeke's plan. It feels a bit suspicious. It also contradicts everything Eren believes in. But I also feel like Zeke is smart enough not to be fooled by Eren? So idk, I just want to see more!!!"
dogenroll,HarmonicWalrus,"I can definitely believe Eren hated how protective Mikasa was over him, but I find it very hard to believe he hated her (or even mildly disliked her) all that time. We've seen plenty of moments where he showed that he cared for her and appreciated their bond just as much as he did for Armin."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,boomstickah,"Funny how quickly Zeke goes from villain to sympathetic figure in the course of a 23 minute episode. 

And man, is Levi dead? He seemed to be enjoying inflicting pain on Zeke a bit too much. :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kreadus005,Levi casually chopping Zeke's feet off and dehumanizing him was a bit too much for me. It really was easier to watch when we knew nothing about him except the fact he piloted monke.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,l_overwhat,"The amount of plot threads at this point is fucking ridiculous. How did Kraut know about Mikasa and Armin? Why did Eren laugh when Sasha died? Does Eren even actually agree with Zeke? If he does, how does any of what he did in Marley further his plans? Why is he being a dick to his friends? Why did he orchestrate a coup? 

It goes on and on and on. I have a feeling I'm going to not be satisfied with the conclusion to all of this."
l_overwhat,FluffDuckling,Pretty sure Eren‚Äôs laugh was more hysterical than mirth. Like you know how sometimes people respond to trauma in odd or socially incorrect ways?
FluffDuckling,nativeofvenus,"I honestly identified with Eren so much in that scene. Trying to find the humor in horrible situations has been a go to reflex of mine out of self preservation for a long time. I remember watching that scene and laughing at the absurdity and irony of her last words being ‚Äúmeat‚Äù and then being punched in the gut with sadness once that reality of her death set in, much like Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DilapidatedHam,Personally bummed that Erin is a fascist now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,leadz579,"I dont know who's the Bad and Good Guy anymore. All i know is that i will keep moving forward, until floch that bastard is dead."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vivere_aut_mori,"A man chooses, an Ackerman obeys."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ribby97,"It's seriously worrying me how many commenters are saying they find it hard to pick sides.

&#x200B;

Obviously fuck Zeke. Obviously fuck Floch. Obviously fuck Eren (except that he's obviously got a secret plan to use the rumbling or something and there's a big ol' twist coming). If this wasn't where you ended up then I hope I never have the misfortune to encounter you irl."
ribby97,Objective_Reindeer42,exactly
ribby97,qvier1,I mean if thats how a show made you actually feel then i really hope no one encounter you irl buddy
qvier1,ribby97,"I mean Floch is a fascist thug, you‚Äôve at least got to give me that one. And Zeke‚Äôs plan is something the Nazis did and some say China is currently doing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TfWashington,Eren said Mikasa had no choice but to protect him since he was the King but Levi didn't seem to have a problem kicking him
TfWashington,MUSinfonian,I mean let‚Äôs look at it in a different light: he was protecting him from the MP‚Äôs killing him in Season 1. Did he injure him? Absolutely. But injuring him is obviously a better outcome than killing him.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crash18867,"I mean Levi.....maybe setting up a nuke and sitting next to the nuke wasn't the smartest of ideas?

Also, is episode 16 next week? This tv guide thing is saying episode 15 is on the 28th"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yousssefel,"Never seen a studio as controversial as MAPPA, they butchered some facial animations, the fight between Levi and Seig (with shitty animations, cheap CGI and one of the worst OST ever made for a fight scene) in the 14th episode, and then here comes the 15th episode who was a MASTERPIECE in every aspect..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dracob2099,Beast titan's animation looks so terrible...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,killertortilla,"This whole story feels dumber every episode, or it's just missing something huge that should have been explained ages ago.

First of all, where is all this mass brain washing going on to convince every single Eldyan that they are lesser and need to atone for something they had nothing to do with? Humans don't just wake up and think ""ah shit guess I'm part of the trash race."" There is one underground organisation that's only half convinced but I haven't seen a single non-paradise Eldyan that thinks they are normal humans. So where is it happening? Even places like North Korea have defectors that realise their country is lying to them even though they are fed propaganda about how evil the west is from the moment they are born. Are Eldyans just genetically fucking stupid?

Mikasa's brain washing isn't much better. I seriously doubt you could train a 5 year old to be a murderer for their entire life to the point where they physically cannot control themselves when some triggers happen.

And all that is making all their plans really fucking stupid. They have SO much power in their hands with the titans and yes they also deeply despise the titans but you have so many options. You could kill all the Marleans, you could force them into an agreement, you could work with other countries. But no, the ""plan"" they have is to kill themselves, sterilise their entire race, or probably stop whatever it is that makes Eldyans into titans.

Even Eren is now somehow convinced all Eldyans need to be sterilised or what the fuck ever.

Side note: So fucking bored of [THIS](https://imgur.com/Rxg7pFV) face being used to show every. single. negative emotion. It is horrified, angry, sad, surprised, and whatever else it needs to be when something sucks."
killertortilla,WonPika,"What do you mean you've ""never seen a non-paradise Eldian that thinks they are normal humans?"" Did you literally forget that Grisha is a non-paradise Eldian that doesn't buy into the bull-shit propaganda that Marley has been feeding them? Or Dina, Grisha's wife? Or that there was an *entire* group of Marley Eldians who were apart of a secret Eldian restorationist movement???? Did you even watch the episode? Why exactly did you think Grisha was arrested for?


 And what do you mean ""where is the brain washing happening?"" How exactly were you expecting the brain washing is supposed to work? Did you expect Marley to strap Eldians into chairs, tape their eyes open, and force them to watch propaganda videos for hours in a dark room until their brains go numb??? Obviously the brain washing takes many forms, one of which is just like racism in real life where its built into every facet of society and effects you subconsciously, how they are mistreated, demonized, and given fake promises of redemption and rewards. Another form is generational bondage. Eldians have been born and raised since a young age to believe that they are devils for generations. It's called indoctrination. And if you are at all familiar with religions or cults, you will know it's a very hard mindset to break once its been planted in your brain.

As for Eren, have some patients and try and use a bit of critical thinking. What do you know of Eren? What are his beliefs? Do those beliefs actually align with Zeke's?  Don't just take everything at face value. Think a little. The show isn't stupid at all. It's incredibly well written."
WonPika,killertortilla,"No need to be an asshole about it I didn't insult you.

As I said the movement only half believes any of it, Grisha only half believes it. Their goal wasn't to be free it was to sterilise Eldians so no titans could be born again. That doesn't solve anything it would just make the Eldians oppressed even more when the Marlean government realises they can't even be used as weapons anymore. 

The propaganda hasn't been shown at all, all we know is Eldians just believe all this shit nearly completely. The brain washing doesn't make any sense if you don't explain it and they haven't. Racism can be used as a tool to brain wash but it doesn't do anywhere near this much damage. No race on earth has ever been broken to this degree. Plenty of races have been enslaved, killed, and abused, but those people do not suddenly start believing that they are scum and villains. This is proper brain washing where children can be turned into blood thirsty killing machines that truly believe killing their own people is akin to killing actual devils. That's not propaganda that's full blown magic.

There are some *slight* real world equivalents like some African nations recruiting children and giving them weapons to fight but that's not brain washing. Those children are forced to have drug dependencies so they stay with the army to get more."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mushatazm,Wait what happened to the end of the episode before this one? Where can I watch the missing 4 minutes...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OOM-32,Did Zeke just commit suicide for real when Levi had him in the cart?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingBowser64,"Ok the scene where you see Mr. Ksaver‚Äôs wife and son. Look at the stuffed animals on the left.
Am I seeing things...? Do they resemble...Armin and Mikasa...? üòÖ"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Somethingblueee,"I never hated that  ""to be continued""  so much before in my life..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,emarie__,I‚Äôm thinking that the founding titan created the ackermans by altering their biology after learning that is a power the founding titan holds.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,drank_your_water,Damn I really thought Grisha was playing the long con by letting zeke rat him out but I gueeeeesssssss not
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gamegeddon,If Zeke's plan of euthanasia will eliminate Eldians in a century or so why does he have to betray Marley? If he just told Marley his plan why would they not be OK with it?
Gamegeddon,Jack1066,"I think its because he knows that Marley doesn't actually *want* Eldians to be eliminated. They keep them subjugated, but the fact is, that Marley is only a significant military power because of the titans. Their warfare relies on being able to use the Eldians to destroy cities as Titans. If Eldians are sterilised, Marley only has a few years to completely revamp the way they fight before other countries take revenge. Look at what happened at the start of S4, they got caught in a 3 year war just because people heard they lost the Female and Colossal titan"
Gamegeddon,thesharp0ne,Because Marley has been hypocritically using the power of the Titans and Eldians to fight their wars. Zeke aims to take away the only thing that has made Marley the dominant power.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ronniethehbk87,Does anybody know why Levi strapped Zeke to a thunder spear?  Its seems like such a stupid idea as Zeke has a way better chance at living through a blast that Levi does. And it for sure wasn't to keep Zeke from transforming as Levi was already cutting away his limbs for that.  Levi could have just tied Zeke up to keep him from jumping off the wagon. Just seems like thinly veiled plot device to get Levi out of the rest of the story.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kidgorgeous62,How is no one talking about the fact that eren beat the shit out of armin and told Mikasa he hated her all along?
kidgorgeous62,HarmonicWalrus,"Most people saw that in the partial episode last week and already discussed it, so by now it's old news."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yemani,Now I understand why Zeke loves throwing stuff so much.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RenPex,"I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I understand how Erens disposition would change after taking back Shiganshina in S3, but it‚Äôs so hard for me to watch him now. I loved the scene when they‚Äôre on the railway and he was saying that his friends were the most important to him, but the scene with Mikasa and Armin actually broke my heart. I know that his plan was revealed, but his personality shift felt so sudden and it‚Äôs lost on me rn üò≠


Also FUCK GRISHA. Man fucked up not one but BOTH of his sons."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Alexandre_Man,"At some point in EP 15 Reiner says that Grisha Jager is ""missing"", so I'm wondering: do we even know what he became after the attack on Shiganshina on the very first episode?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,slasher71,Why can't the fix by the founding Titan be that all eldians become normal humans too?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HebertoAteJelly,How many episodes in part one? A few weeks ago i was told there would be onlune 15 episodes in part 1. Is this the last one?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,boomstickah,"I'm due a rewatch, but how did Bertholdt and Reiner know that Eren had the founding?"
boomstickah,thesharp0ne,"I believe it was when Eren commanded the titans to eat Dina Fritz' Titan (Smiling Titan), they realized he held the ""Coordinate"" (AKA Founding Titan)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thegamerman0007,Why did Eren tell Mikasa I hate you. I don't understand that.
thegamerman0007,dogenroll,"Because he believe that in freedom and in the ability to make decisions without being a slave. Being free is what he constantly preaches. Mikasa's Akermann blood is tweaked to find a ""host"" to protect, which in this case is Eren. So as you've seen countless times, Mikasa is ALWAYS quick to react in a way that protects Eren, and this is not done by free choice or will, she's basically programmed to protect him. Just like when Armin tried to punch him, she stepped in instinctively, even though he was being an ass to both Armin and herself. Eren hates slaves."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kac_kat123,If we somehow get Levi and Eren on the same side for an awesome team up i would die
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hawtbutterypopcorns,"Even though I have a little bit more sympathy for zeke after the whole backstory episode, I will still go back a rewatch Levi absolutely destroy him (again)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tyler980908,I haven't been this sweaty in a long time.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gomegantron,So is there only one episode left? Will there be another part?
gomegantron,thesharp0ne,There will need to be a Part 2 if MAPPA intends to animate til the end as they've said they will.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jollyradtime,"Did anybody catch the part where they discussed the plague that was cured by the founding Titan? 

Didn‚Äôt Grisha also cure a plague? It was mentioned in episode 1. I can‚Äôt recall the exact timeline but what if he did that with the founding titan‚Äôs powers? Wouldn‚Äôt he have needed somebody of royal blood around & in Titan form to make that happen?"
jollyradtime,mishamaro,I think that was just Grisha coming from a land that had antibiotics...it wasn't a founding titan thing.
mishamaro,jollyradtime,"Yeah probably. Just a kinda crazy coincidence since he did at one point have the founding Titan and also cured a plague, you know?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,strassi3,Whats the name of the OST playing during Flochs speech in front of the recutes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gigi_1803,I was wondering why they broke out a war to save Eldians in an Eldian containment zone. Now it makes sense
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ccharles1550,"1 episode left. No news of a Part 2 or Movie in sight.
Where can I ready the manga IN COLOR. Someone said this is chapter 114 right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bozmegozonia,Is it just me or the quality of the drawings is even better?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Paprikal," So considering that Eren is willing to go forward with the euthanasia plan, and that Zeke has titan blood, why did they wait to enact it? Zeke could have just transform when they were talking together in Marley and Eren could have touched him and use the power of the founding. Sure, the military would have found it suspicious for him to transform inside a city, but that seems like a small price to pay to accomplish his life-long objective.

The only reason I can find is that they first want to unite the world against Eldian, so that the annihilation of Eldian can help bring world peace? But that seems like quite a gamble to make, and a complicated detour that could (and has) easily disturbed their plan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Paprikal,"One thought I had while watching ep. 74: I wonder how some characters from Paradise would have reacted if they learned about this plan. If we take someone like Armin, I feel like he could have understood the rationale behind erasing the Eldian to end the cycle of hatred and protect the world ; but at the same time, he would probably react similarly to Kaya, with the (quite understandable) discourse that ""the people in the wall didn't do anything wrong, why must be punished"".

That's what I found interesting: we can say that the people living in the wall have generally led better lives than the Eldian in Marley (except maybe the Scouts). That's why they would probably see Zeke's plan as unjust toward them. But to Zeke, Eren, and Ms.Ksaver, ending the lives of Eldian is not a punishment but a mercy, because in the world that they know, living as an Eldian means suffering.

And this also maybe helps to explain why Zeke doesn't show any remorse when he's killing Eldian: maybe he genuinely believes that he is doing them a favor by killing them (and his dialogue with Levi about how ""he didn't kill people, he saved lives"" seems to point to that direction). Or, you know, maybe all the trauma just turned him into a sociopath."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lunchbag-mermaid,"I was really interested in seeing Ksaver‚Äôs beast titan but sadly we didn‚Äôt. I googled it and can see why it was kinda useless in battle, but definitely interesting and wonder what it symbolises"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jolewhea,"Surely there isn't just 1 more episode, right?  They're going to do that mid-season finale fake out thing, right?  They've opened too many storylines for them to wrap it up in a 25 minute episode unless episode 16 is a feature length film...

And wtf is up with Eren telling Mikasa he hates her??  That can't be true, right?  I'm so confused and angry and just...fuck."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NOMERVARIUM,"Is placing an explosive to a person, who basically survived several of those explosives and regenerated, a logical thing to do? Taking into account that that person can trigger the explosive any time and you are 1 meter away from that. Idk man seems kinda dumb to me."
NOMERVARIUM,rajajackal,"when he was blown out of the nape, he was at full strength. levi's been wounding him so that his body has to work hard to regenerate and he can't transform. makes sense to assume an explosion lodged inside of him in that state would finish him off. obviously i'm still expecting zeke to miraculously survive cause that's what happens in television and movies lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cardigancat,levi was absolutely hot for that
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,botbuabm,"Maybe I don't remember it correctly but was Grisha not first told about titans/transforming when the Owl saved him in paradise and gave him his Attack Titan?

Because in this episode they were telling Zeke about becoming a Warrior and inheriting a Titan

I'm confusion"
botbuabm,thesharp0ne,"Eldians outside of the walls all know that Eldians have the power to transform into titans and that there are nine titan powers that can be inherited. Up until the point that Grisha inherited the Attack Titan, no one knew who truly held that titan power. Marley had 7/9, they knew Eldia/Paradis had 1/9 (Founder), but the Attack Titan was MIA up until that point."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,callmehalleluja,"so, if the founding titan can change the anatomy of eldians bodies, could it be that when marley got the founding titan in their hands, they forced him/her to ""create"" the pure titans?

if this is true, it would make the eldians/jews allegory better because then it would make marley/nazis the one who made them all into man eating monsters/""jews are the root of all problems"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SalmonCrusader,Eren is an aggressive libertarian
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainSmeg,How the fuck do they give some sort of finale/conclusion next week?!
CaptainSmeg,thesharp0ne,"spoiler alert: theres going to be a part 2 to this season, but the studios been pretty tight lipped on it. Today's episode covered about Chapter 114, the manga is on Ch 138 right now, so theres 0% chance they dont do a part 2 if their intent is to actually animate until the end."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlasphemousTortoise,"Seeing Keith beat up probably really hurt Hange, considering she used to idolise him :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noir-ojos,"Can someone explain the timeline to me? Did Zeke get Beast at the same time as Reiner and the others got their titans? Because he seems to be the only one whose time is almost up, I‚Äôm so confused"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Flamingslayer11,Is levi dead/gravely injured???
Flamingslayer11,illumantimess,My general rule of thumb in this show is they aren‚Äôt dead unless you see them explode in a cloud of blood
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JohnYeager-man,Confirmed Levi is British‚òï
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nut_Waxer,"Ik the episode tried to make you sympathize with zekes perspective, and I definitely understand his perspective now. That said I had a big grin on my face when he activated the thunder spear, FUCK ZEKE hope ymir slaps him a few times in eldian hell.
(Edit) also is anyone gonna mention how badass Levi was to kill all his titan comrades just so Zeke wouldn‚Äôt escape, Levi got that iron will."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoreMegadeth,isnt next week suppose to be the finale? did a part 2 get confirmed?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrsSntgo,Series finale title: The Eldians and The Final Solution.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mctravie,Curious if the Asian bloodline has any powers which might counter the ackermen blood
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Revanthmk23200,"Why did Zeke say that it wont be a good idea for Eren to touch him, like the whole plan wad to someone with the founding titan to touch some titan with the royal blood right. So why not do it there?"
Revanthmk23200,JessieN,Maybe he didn't trust him fully?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Snatat,So the previous beast titan was eluded to be a sheep huh.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,triggerhappy66,"Episode 15 gave me fucking chills because when Zeke was talking about his wish to never let any more eldian children be born, I instantly remembered the video I watched YESTERDAY about this exact theory: https://youtu.be/6O5S2Y4FhJ0 its fucking crazy to me that I watched this just before this episode, what a coincidence. Watch it if you want to have a more in depth explanation of what Zeke might be envisioning"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deliciouscorn,"Kinda wonder what kind of crappy Beast Titan form that guy had to be in order to be relegated to performing research and playing catch lol

Opossum Beast Titan?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,triggerhappy66,remember the whole: because I was born into this world- thing? Well all along it was referring to Zekes plan I guess. Holy shit this foreshadowing is on another level aot is insane
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cmtr2113,There‚Äôs no way that the next episode is the last one of the entire show. Judging from the promo it looks like there‚Äôs still so much information to cover and a few episodes ago they hinted in a post credit scene that a huge battle is going to erupt. There has to be a part 2 or at least a movie.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LTLuke75,Levi isn't dead!?? Right?? If Levi died in that explosion I'm killing myself
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mctravie,I could be wrong but from what I remember there were certain Eldian people who were resistant or immune to the Memory manipulation won‚Äôt that be an issue for the eutrophication
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrBlqckBird242,*Sad Monke noises*
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrBlqckBird242,"Levi: what that time to cut off another leg

Zeke: monke go boom"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JESquirrel,"Got to be honest, I didn't really want an entire back story episode right now. With the next episode being the last I was wanting something more substantial."
JESquirrel,realkin1112,"is knowing Zeke¬¥s real intentions not substantial enough, he was literally the most mysterious character in the whole show before this episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Migweenie,Does anyone know how they‚Äôll handle the rest of the story? Like a second half of the season or 1 movie or something ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,samgo88,guys but eren wasnt have founder titan when he save mikasa. he was just ordinary boy. why would mikasa obey him.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,s96g3g23708gbxs86734,Did Levy die? Would he be so stupid? He stayed there risking his life? I don't think so
s96g3g23708gbxs86734,Payment-Hour,"How would he know Zeke was going to immolate!? Levi couldn‚Äôt kill him, they needed to pass his power, the island was going to be attacked soon, and not having the rumbling as a weapon was not an option."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rajajackal,"grisha is john lennon. he completely fucked up his first son (zeke = julian), did a better job as a father to his second (sean = eren) before croaking on him"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Waymsical,"Probably Eren it's just gonna use Zeke.. but still I think that zeke's plan it's the most logical and viable solution, so eldians don't get killed and the rest of the world it's not destroyed/slaved"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,whatsurplan2nite,Wtf wtf wtf wtf
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SauceyButler,"So is 16 really gonna be the last episode?? Or is it gonna go into part 2? 

Because one website talked about it today and said it's going to be the last episode of the series, but I don't see how that's possible unless they're planning on doing OVAs to round it all off or something."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,a-curious-guy,"Is it not possible for eren to remove the ""titan-making"" bit?

Seems to all lie with the spinal fluid, so if he changes that then he can make everyone normal?"
a-curious-guy,cybersidpunk,yes but then they wont have the leverage to stay alive. the world will just kill them for the island's resources.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bellemarez,Soo why didn‚Äôt Zeke and Eren go through with their sterilization plan earlier?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kandoh,What do you guys think the beast Titan normally looks like? Less like a monkey? Maybe it has four paws and that's why it sucked?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chowdahhh,"Hold up, if their plan all along was the euthanization why couldn't Zeke and Eren have just done it when they were in Marley together? I don't really see a point anymore in them attacking Marley and having the Scouts take them back to Paradis"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nadavkra,"could anybody help me make some sense of Zeke and Eren's plans, according to everything revealed by the anime this far? I definitely missed some marks and everything feels convoluted to catch up at this point. can't even remember what the royal family's fuss is all about lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jruiz2991,"Can someone answer me how they are suppose to end the series with one episode left and alot of plot to cover. My theory is that there will be a part 2 like season 3, but according to twitter this will be the finale."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Arpx,"If Eren agreed with Zeke, why he didn't eat Zeke to gain the powers of the real family? Why did Eren attacked Marley?"
Arpx,No3sc4pe,Eating Zeke doesnt transfer the power of his heritage. It only transfers the titan power  which is seperate from his royal blood.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Minshow,"So Zeke turning the scouts in the forest affected all the eldians who drank the wine. So the question is, did it trigger and not work because of distance? Did it ""use"" the spinal fluid, making the rest safe, or are they just connected to him some way forever, and will feel it every time until its them? If there is no distance limit, maybe Zeke turned the rest of the people into titans as he pulled the pin on the thunder spear?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jboyXD,"Everyone‚Äôs starting to hate eren, but the dude looks miserable. I don‚Äôt think he wants to do this, but has to"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,alleee1121,"When you realize there's no one at fault. The Yeager brothers fighting for the Eldian race to save them from humiliation and world hate. The Scouts fighting for Eldia for its survival (with the premise that to kill is wrong no matter the reason behind is). All to preserve humanity despite the cruel, warped world. The world is indeed vile to make these characters risk their lives fighting for it. The only path to salvation is death, to euthanize Eldia and end the age of the Titans. Zeke's backstory has always struck a heavy arrow and he cannot be blamed for his acts. He, too, was a victim.

It pains more to see and realize that nobody can be put on the blame."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ItDoesntGetAnybeTtah,"Can't believe only one episode left. I knew Zeke's original intentions will be shown eventually. His father used him as a tool for revenge and never really sees him as a son and that ultimately made him feel alienated from his parents. And he saw a father figure to mr.Ksaver and mr. Ksaver treated Zeke as a son himself who was a damaged person as well. No wonder he did what he did and he was only acting based from what he believes is right for the mankind as a whole, can't really blame him. I believe I would have the same mindset as him if I were to be in that position. His definitely in the chaotic good category. Why bother being born when your existence will inevitably cause suffering to other people and most importantly to you as well."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditer51,"So Eren plans to euthanize all the Eldians, essentially driving everyone he once held dear extinct.

We...have come quite a long ways since episode 1.

In a twisted way, it still fits, since he's still trying to kill all Titans. Its like the author took Eren's main motivation and shoved it up its own ass, thus deconstructing itself. Like he's still trying to kill all titans, but so much of the context has changed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,clefayble,I don‚Äôt see how this is all gonna get wrapped up in a half hour next week. There has to be more right?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Francordz1245,Why do they cut a lot of details in the anime that they give in the manga
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jboyXD,I highly doubt erens always ‚Äúhated‚Äù mikasa and wanted to beat up armin. Either he‚Äôs going to do something horrible and doesn‚Äôt want them to feel bad or the three titans memories  and his visit to Marley fried his brain
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DapperDaveW,"So is Eren lying to the Jaegerists because the Eren/Zeke plan sounds like the opposite of what the Jaegerists would want.

* Too bad Levi killed all 30 pure titans that Zeke transformed.  Otherwise he could have chucked Zeke's body into one of their mouths and gotten rid of Zeke and gotten a bonus buddy back.  Instead he had to go on a hay ride with Zeke to go make another pure titan.  Then both got blowed up anyway on the way."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,infantgambino,"So is this gonna be the last we hear about jaegerists jacking zeke off and his master plan to ""save eldia""? Still not sure if Eren is on board with the plan fully but eren is clearly not in the right mind"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Optimal_Bit_5600,"Damn, two episodes back to back was a treat. I did admittedly cave in and watch the 17 minute version of episode 14 last week, but it was still nice seeing the high quality, full version today along with episode 15.  As for my thoughts, 14 was a great follow up to last episode, giving us the long awaited EMA meeting and rematch between Zeke and Levi. The EMA meeting wasn't as lengthy as I expected, but was still a hard scene to watch due to Eren wrecking both of his best friends either mentally or physically. While I have a sneaking suspicion that Eren is putting up an act and doesn't mean what he's saying, the whole thing with Mikasa being manipulated by some generational brain-washing akin to the Reiss family was a hell of a twist. It's something that retroactively makes Mikasa much more interesting, and fixes my major issue with her in past seasons (being obsessive and over protective of Eren). Kudos to Armin for standing up to Eren too, even if he was no match in a fight. As for Levi vs Zeke, it may not have had the same fluid animation as Imai's action sequences, but much like episode 7 the direction and pacing still carried it. Considering the tight schedule, it turned out better than I expected, and the whole forest sequence was thrilling to watch overall.   


Now as good as 14 was, 15 is another story. This was a phenomenal episode that is right up there with Declaration of War and Assault as being among my favorite episodes this whole season. Genuinely feel really, really bad for Zeke, and while I don't agree at all with his plan, I completely understand where he's coming from. Poor kid had a shitty childhood, with that scene where Grisha was freaking out in the other room actually making me tense up as if I were right there alongside Zeke. It's just one of the many strengths of this story, how much perspective can alter things with this episode and That Day showing two sides of the same coin. And yeah that last scene looked gorgeous, definitely one of the best MAPPA has put out for this adaptation. Only one more episode left until we say goodbye for a bit, interested to see how they leave off this story before we head to the actual final stretch of episodes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Careb,"Wait so Eren tells Mikasa that she only reacted because her natural instinct is to protect the king but he wasn‚Äôt the king yet. He was still just Eren, he didn‚Äôt become the Founding Titan until after. Or did I misunderstand????"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GodPowardKingOfLies,"See, I get episode 15 was meant to build sympathy and motivations for Zeke, but the whole eugenics plan kinda killed any sense of ""gray"" I had in this storyline for him. It immediately made him the bad guy from his doomer ass plan. Eren may not be the bad guy, if he actually isn't going along with Zeke's plan, but it no doubt makes the Jaegerists the bad guys in my mind.




Also, fuck Floch."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ItsAle-A,QUDJUHVDJCLPSMSJBZNICCEVHS
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ItsAle-A,"La intenci√≥n de Grisha era la correcta pero fue un p√©simo padre.

Pero ahora, Eren y Zeke quieren matar a todos los eldianos o simplemente hacer que no tengan hijos? A largo plazo es lo mismo, pero me gustar√≠a saber lo que interpretaron"
ItsAle-A,Payment-Hour,"Hacer que no tengan hijos, no se porque hablan de eutanasia si es esterilizaci√≥n. Creo que es por el hecho de una ‚Äúmuerte sin dolor‚Äù."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arrivillaga,Zeke: Immediate genocide of the majority would make me feel too guilty. Immediate genocide of the minority would make me feel less guilty but it's too hard. Gradual genocide of the minority by way of sterilization would make me feel even less guilty and it's easier.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,acetrainerwill,Already saw a comment about this but the main I gathered is that Zeke and Eren belong in r/antinatalism
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mc-Ramon,"Today felt like an extra holiday, we got gifted not only two fire episodes but also a fire 2 episode thread. After watching these episodes I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs a bad guy anymore and the root of the hatred in the world seems very ‚Äúwhat came first the chicken or egg‚Äù but with Eldians and Marley and the back story with Zeke really makes me not hate zeke anymore I have hate for Grisha but it‚Äôs hard because he had a rough childhood that jaded him and made him that way and then I feel like he changed when he was in paradis. As for now I still hate floch ever since he was introduced and I‚Äôm lowkey hating Eren for beating up my boy Armin and making Mikasa cry. I do feel like it‚Äôs gonna play out like lelouch in code geass with Eren but man it was tough seeing Eren hurt his day 1s. Also Levi can‚Äôt be dead y‚Äôall he doesn‚Äôt die. So much happened in these two episodes that I‚Äôm still kind of shook so thank you Isayama and MAPPA and everyone that helped bring this masterpiece to us."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"If the founding Titan can change the blueprint of Eldians, than one possible solution to ending suffering is sterilizing all Eldians using the founding Titan. I was thinking that another solution might be using the founding Titan to erase whatever it is that makes Eldians, well, eldians, to stop them from inheriting Titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RocketSG,which manga chapters are for this episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hushzone,"Few timing questions. 

Is it just me or did ksavers convo with Zeke about royal blood not really make sense? To their knowledge the royal family still has the founding titan so why would zeke be the key because he can activate those powers by touch? It's like they already knew the founding titan went to a non royal bloodline. It'd be more logical to say youre the one who needs to take the founding titan 

When are Reinholdt reporting to Zeke? I guess after Reiner sees Eren using coordinate? It seems odd that they figure out that Eren is more than just the attack titan but I guess it's possible"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aht116,"What I don't understand is why they waited so long? They were both in titan form in the Marley invasion, they could've just done it then and there???"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,appleberi,Why did they label sole salvation as #14 even though it's the 15th episode of season 4?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,berferd77,So is next week the last episode ever? Or will there be a second part? How are they going to finish the story in one episode? Help me!
berferd77,realkin1112,"there is still like 14 to 16 episodes worth of content, so pretty sure there is a part two"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nandir07,Pieck is on the island guys!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,behemon,Just want to say: Fuck Floch and his punchable hair )>\_<(
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CheLabani,Is this why Eren targeted the Warhammer titan so that Levi cant kill him? because at this point I dont see a reason to go after WH titan and shouldve just asked Zeke to meet him on the island. I think Eren should just use Historia as a dumb titan and use WH powers to encase her into a cage and put her inside of him and just use the rumbling anytime he wants... Dark but works.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chinny570,"I'm gonna wait til the final episode but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna read the manga after. So much has happened and I don't think I can wait for a season 4 part 2 or movie sherbet that'll come out. Plus knowing how toxic people are with spoilers of major movies and shows I am not putting myself up to get major spoilers by waiting for the anime to finally finish as well.

I just have to decide if I'm going to read the manga from the very beginning or from where next week's episode coincides."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,suri14,"What I don't understand is if you want to stop eldians to procreate then you can always kill your own people to accelerate the process and reduce suffering.. maybe I don't understand the thing but seems a bit stupid.. what's the point of the whole war if what you want to achieve is ""eldian euthanization"" ??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eduhbert,I've been insisting in how despicable Floch is since the beginning and now it couldn't be more clear why
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Syphorce,"Both of these episodes were rough. I overstand the struggle Dina and Grisha were fighting against. Its wild, but very believeable, that Zeke would go the other way and would seek to euthanize all titans as a means of ending suffering. You have Eldians being born into slavery basically and its a life of suffering under Marleyean rule, but the power of becoming a titan has been so abused.  


Who else is willing to place bets that Armin and Mikasa will fight for Eldians to cohabitate like the rest of non-titan humans in the world? That seems like the protagonist journey in this story. I just wish we could have seen Eren's transformation of becoming this edgelord instead of a time skip."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lordofthekebabs,They didn't do the ban cum plan right away in Liberio because first they have to go to Paradise and activate rumbling in order to protect the last Eldians from outside world until they extinct
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wafflezzzz2,There's no way they can finish the series in the next episode right?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,As_for_myself,"Does anyone know what the OST is called in episode 15, starting from 10:30?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ph4ntonW0lf,Ok I'm a little confused about Eren and Mikasa. Eren said that the Ackerman's were basically following orders to protect the royal family or something and so she was just following orders when he told her to fight and basically protect him. But he didn't have the founding titan at that point right? Does that matter at all?
Ph4ntonW0lf,WonPika,"Eren said that their initial purpose was just to protect the royal family. But it has nothing to do with having royal blood (which Eren doesn't have at all, nor does it have anything to do with having a titan) but rather selecting a sort of ""host"" to protect. Mikasa chose Eren as the ""host"" she would protect that day - or at least so Eren says. We don't know how much of what he said to Mikasa and Armin was truth and how much was just to trigger them. For example, unless it's a plot hole or just hasn't been mentioned, why hasn't Levi been said to have a host or show the same level of obsessive protectiveness toward a specific person? On top of that, Eren also said that it was the reason for the headaches, but Levi hasn't been seen to suffer from headache's either? 

This isn't to say I think Eren was lying, but that might have exaggerated the truth or said half-truths."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nikhil_Subba,"The female titan that Beast titan tore up like a paper was one of the soldiers that requested Levi for wine. Damn, it was so satisfying seeing Levi clapping Beast titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maddogkaz,They really butchered the scene where they talk at the table they took away a bunch of Erens dialogue. Why would they do that he said some important stuff when he was talking to Mikasa and Armin but for some reason they didn't have him say any of it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fuckenshreddit,What‚Äôs up with Eren all of a sudden hating Armin? That dude nearly killed the scouts to save Armin from dying in season 3
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Datannoyingkid,"I swear to ymir most of the cast just needs a hug and a good talk to reach an understanding. But this is aot, the new evangalion. Maybe we'll have a TTGL but for shonen. Also I kinda like how zeke already had hardening as soon as he went monke titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tuff_Lock,Who is Levi protecting/serving?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gregfess,"I don't get Erens switch to hating Mikasa and Armin. He has Eren Kruger's memory, and he wanted to save Armin and Mikasa, so he should too. Unless it's just the founding Titan that can influence future shifters"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Stellaabigail,People who recently gave in and read the manga - was it worth it or do you wish you had waited? I think I might start reading after s4 part 1 is done... I'm seeing  new spoilers on a weekly basis... I don't know how to make it through the time between part 1 and part 2/a last movie whatever

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LongShoeLace,"can some one explain to me why zeke and eren didn't touch and put the plan in action when they met in marley before the attack? what was the point of postponing the plan? they are trying to find each other right after the attack, so what did they gain from waiting this 1 month after they returned to paradis?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jolewhea,"So what do we think happened to Falco?  He started to feel zekes call in that carriage with Hange.  Did he have enough spinal fluid to turn or just feel tingly?  The next time we see Hange, she's a prisoner....so???  Is Falco a titan somewhere captive?  Are they gonna feed someone to him?  They wouldn't kill him off camera so I know something is coming lol."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GroundbreakingSort32,"Does anyone know who levi wanted to protect with his awakened ackermann power? Why is he the only ackermann not bound by this? It explains kennys headaches, it explains pretty much 100% of mikasa‚Äôs entire being, but doesnt explain levi."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the6ixpaths,Does anybody know what's up with the next episode number at the end of the episode always behind one number behind?
the6ixpaths,jbdmt87,"If you're on Funimation, it's because they've included the Chronicle recap movie in the list of episodes. It's number 60. So episode 60 (season 4 episode 1) shows up as 61 on the list of episodes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,peterXforreal,Only watched anime. Can anyone tell whether founding titan is included among the 9 titans or not? Or is founding titan something on its own?

these are the 9..."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cheat_Adil,"I got a manga spoilers about 3 weeks ago and the anime is still not here. I don't think the final episode will explain much, it will probably go out with a bang"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wannabeaggie123,"The titan euthanasia shit makes no sense. Maybe for zeke because he was disillusioned to think that titans were the true threat after all.

This show is starting to feel like it's got no real plot. Just a discombobulated mess. Oh this guy thinks this way because of this thing that happened but then this guy told him that hey lol that's not right so then his convictions changed? Like wtf is going on?

Grishas take is the still the only one that makes any fucking sense. Unless he's wrong. Unless the restorationist were wrong? Like the owl guy had brainwashed them and not told them that ymir was actually the threat to humanity and didn't help like he said she did. Because if she did then why the fuck would you eliminate titans? Idk man this shit giving me game of thrones last season vibes and I really hope shit makes sense or I'm very off on everything."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gezzanixon,"The final episode is next week, it surely has to be like an hour long they can't wrap everything up in 25 minutes?!"
Gezzanixon,Raknel,Gonna be a s4 part 2 for sure
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StochasticMind,How are they going to end the series in the next episode? Does seem likely! So many plots to cover

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hazychestnutz,is this the season finale? is there a part 2 coming out later this year?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,franksaxx,Is the basement still a mystery or am I forgetting what happened there
franksaxx,youmemba,Grisha's memoir was in there
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VlBE-CHECK,"So I hear the next episode will be the last? Is this the end of AOT Anime or will there be another part kinda like season 3? And if so, how much longer til the next half comes out?"
VlBE-CHECK,GodPowardKingOfLies,"There will definitely be another part of the season, as there is a LOT more to cover. The gap between part 1 of season 3 and part 2 was about 6 months, so that's about as good a guess as I can muster."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dhari13,"Let's me just start by saying I'm anime only. Trying to connect the dots, i went to see the last interaction between the owl and Grisha. Holy crap you guys you gotta see it. But, don't look at the comments as there's possible huge spoilers there."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AwesomeAsian,So does Zeke want to end all Titans or all Eldians?
AwesomeAsian,Broadhead349,Well Eldians are the only ones who turn into Titans so it‚Äôs a two birds one stone kinda situation
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Calvinball88,"Yeah, I'm troubled by the whole arc of ""lets euthanize a ethny"" as a good solution. Obviously Eren fucking up with Mikasa and Armin also is super weird.

Since they like deceiving spectators I guess there's a fundamental reason we've not been given yet, but I Feel pretty meh since the last couple episodes.."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gezzanixon,"All I want to search is eren actually evil now or is he like triple bluffing - he's surely hurt mikasa and armin to make them hate him or something
Please don't actually be sworn enemy number 1, broke my heart for mikasa and armin they seemed completely defeated."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gezzanixon,"SOOO the past few episodes they were talking about 'the rumbling' which was some secret weapon that we still don't know about - so that plan has been ditched for now in favour of making all eldian infertile?
Is that right? So the rumbling still exists or is the rumbling the ability to make everyone infertile?"
Gezzanixon,bluebell135,"The rumbling is like nuclear bombs in our world. In real life world powers maybe don‚Äôt want to use them but they are there as a threat for everyone else. The rumbling is what‚Äôs keeping the world powers away from the island, because they assume that as soon as they attack the rumbling will start. Keep in mind that Marley and the other countries don‚Äôt know what zeke or eren wants."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oooshyguy,So I have a question for y‚Äôall being anime only do you think eren is not gonna be faithful to his friends or will he follow zekes plan?
oooshyguy,Tomatomelee,I don't think he will follow through with the plan. It just doesn‚Äôt fit with Eren‚Äôs character. Id be less surprised if Eren decided to burn the rest of the world to ashes tbh. My big brain theory is that Eren wants to eat all of the main titan people and then give it all to a royal blooded person which would bind them all to the vow.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,akanisetti,Is next episode really the last?!
akanisetti,DeepFriedCabbage,nope there will be a part 2 or a movie
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,akanisetti,Wait how is next episode is the final episode if the mange goes on for like another 20 chapters?!?!
akanisetti,DeepFriedCabbage,There will be a part 2 or a movie
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Billowy_Peanut,Anyone know how long the last episode is going to be? I'm gonna be a amazed if they somehow finish AOT in less than 30 minutes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LikeMike04,Yo I think I'm the only one that noticed that the former beast titan warrior shoes up in the geisha flashback episode way back in season 3. Y'all should rewatch the episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dezslock,"The Owl was an Attack Titan and saw the future. Grisha was an Attack Titan and saw the future. Eren too has seen scenes that will happen so I think the Attack Titan has the power or some kind of access to 'memories' from the future. Thus, Eren has probably seen what will happen and is pushing all his friends aways so they don't suffer the consequences. He wants them to live 'long lives'."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PocketPaxton,"When the horses screamed at the end that really got me (I'm an animal lover). It was super cool to hear Zeke's backstory and why he turned his parents in, and see him and Eren have a bond."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zaher9,"Idk if that's right, I think that frame that we saw from eren before he forced zeke out of the memories is him when he was kissing historia's hand from s3 part2. Do you guys think he was seeing the future all the way from that point of the story? Because we saw eren dramatically change as a character."
zaher9,Zard91,"yes, it was shot from s3."
Zard91,DetroitCity1999,So when he kissed her hand is when he saw his dads memories of what happened in e79? Fascinating
zaher9,peoplepleaser11,it looks like that so fucking wild. so if eren saw EVERYTHING after kissing her hand he needed all the self control in the world to not go insane after kissing her hand holy shit
peoplepleaser11,x0midknightfire,Honestly he‚Äôs felt pretty insane since his appearance in part 1 of season 4 lol. Guess that was what caused ‚Äúthat look in his eyes‚Äù that Levi referred to when he saw him in Liberio.
peoplepleaser11,ShaidarHaran2,"Eren was around 16 in season 3.  
 
However this all turns out, like holy fuck is that guy a cool son of a bitch, like how much self control would that take, and how many 16 year olds do you know that would be remotely close to that, most people twice that age wouldn't be."
peoplepleaser11,Twindo,He‚Äôs able to secure his outburst and insanity in that constipation face.
peoplepleaser11,masnachi1,"imagine what he saw when he bonned historia (if you are one of the people that say he is the father of her child). PS: not a spoiler, not confirming or denying it. It is based on anime speculation not manga"
zaher9,_kito,"That time he saw grisha's memories, so he saw everything happening in this episode"
_kito,AudaciousXII,You mean Grisha right?
zaher9,dare_unusual,"yes, it is the face he made while kissing historias hand, you can this earlier in the ep too eren kissing a hand (of historia as in s3ep22)."
zaher9,___fr3n3t1c1ty,"I think he changed mainly in that moment, even in the last episode of s3 he‚Äôs like Different after the hand kiss"
zaher9,reheapify,Now we realized why Eren's shocked face is the second last moment before S3 ends.
reheapify,ShaidarHaran2,"Imagine containing all that new information and only looking shocked for a moment   
 
Monstrous self control, what a gangsta"
zaher9,TheChrisLambert,Definitely. Because that was his first contact with someone with royal blood. He got all the info at that point.
zaher9,TheMemeRemembers,Imo we only saw his father memories. But Eren probably saw EVERYTHING. He changed as a person after that. Imagine knowing that much it would change you too lol
zaher9,Lekii_ii,"But if the attack titan does have powers to look into the future memories of its inheritors, then dosent that mean Grisha saw this all coming from the very start, couldn't he have avoided it. Maybe by not having a kid or so. If he saw that Eren would turn into what he is now, wasn't there a way to prevent it. And how is it that Grisha is able to make contact with Zeke and hear Eren's words. My brain is muddled."
Lekii_ii,Maerify,Eren could use the Attack Titan powers selectively. He only showed Grisha certain memories and said only specific things that manipulated him into doing what he wanted. Grisha was asking brokenly at the end why Eren wouldn‚Äôt show him if Carla was safe (he must‚Äôve told Grisha him killing the Reiss is the only way Carla and Eren would be safe). But I think enough of Eren‚Äôs true memories were seen by Grisha that he wanted Zeke to try to stop Eren
Lekii_ii,aemzso,"Grisha saw Eren's memory of Eren talking to Grisha.

Let me try to lay it out:

In the future (from Grisha's perspective), Eren and Zeke will travel through Grisha's memories with the power of the Founding Titan.  While seeing Grisha hesitate to kill the Reiss family, Eren tells him to stand and finish what he went there to do.

This experience, of course, becomes part of Eren's memories, and so Grisha can see it with the power of the Attack Titan.

Same applies to Grisha and Zeke.  Zeke was with Eren, so Zeke being there is part of Eren's memory, which means Grisha could see him.  Them hugging is a stretch, since I don't think the brothers actually traveled to *the past*, they're just looking through memories, but yeah, that's how they can talk to each other."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thrawayidk,Jesus christ Eren
thrawayidk,lllNico,"yeah, probably actually jesus christ eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Forsaken-Currency404,"Zeke: ""Eren! You have been brainwashed and manipulated by your father!!""

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OverEffective7012,"All Attacking Titans were led to this moment of opposing the king... 
Just astonishing"
OverEffective7012,TypicalPnut,"""Every Attack Titan has always sought out freedom"" -Kruger


Maybe that's because Eren was the one that made them seek that freedom out"
TypicalPnut,kingleomessi_11,"That‚Äôs my theory. The attack titans characteristic isn‚Äôt really a ‚Äúcharacteristic‚Äù per se, but it‚Äôs actually Eren sending past attack titans the memories and influencing them with his unique status as holding both the founder and attack titan. 

If it‚Äôs true then it‚Äôs seriously all predetermined. Everything the previous attack titans did was to lead to Eren getting the founder and attack titan from Grisha."
TypicalPnut,knifeazz,Holy shit now the line from season 3 where Kruger mentions Armin and Mikasa makes sense.
TypicalPnut,Page211,Watching back AOT season 4 part 1 we get a scene with Eren chanting keep fighting to a mirror. I can't help but wonder if this will play a part in future reveal
TypicalPnut,Estelindis,"Every attack titan seeking something they can never quite have, because Eren's future-memories stop them from ever being truly free.  :("
TypicalPnut,DetroitCity1999,"Couldn‚Äôt the past attack titans see erens plan and stop it if they wanted? Maybe they didnt want to stop it

Edit: grisha did say that he didn‚Äôt think erens plan would be so terrible"
OverEffective7012,fuzzybunn,"So... There never was any trait of the attack titans being ""advancers"" or ""moving ahead"" - the trait was future sight, and the doggedness and determination was a side effect of Eren influencing the others?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Giddy4Stiddy,So did Eren Hodor his dad into taking the founding titan?
Giddy4Stiddy,cp710,"Not just that. This is turning out to be the actualized theory people had for Bran that didn‚Äôt end up panning out. That he caused not just the war by making the king go mad but that he was Bran the Builder and built the Wall in the first place. Man, that‚Äôs cool."
cp710,AMK2201,yeah there's a lot of GoT inspiration in the series. Isayama was a big fan. There's even panels of characters that resemble GoT characters.
cp710,vinvear,"Ever since AoT was premiering shortly after the last season of GoT I thought of AoT as the savior of this style of 'epic' storytelling, like Thrones dropped the ball so hard that it's all ruined, but AoT is so good it actually makes up for it."

uniretamukcipusrm,ScepterReptile,Eren to Isayama: Look at me! I am the author now!
uniretamukcipusrm,AuroraFernandazz,"Eren says ""This is the story that you started"" to Krisha but now we know Krisha only did what Eren ordered him to do so technically he didn't start anything, but Eren did. But then again in the first episode Eren sees someone elses memories from the future events so at some point he actually didn't know anything and acted along someone elses memories through paths. Yes, Eren does blame Ymir and the curse but she was also a victim of a manipulation of others. So the question is who the fuck did start the story?"
Wingo21,jediwizard7,"I'm not sure there was any hint of ""good"" last episode... it was pretty clear (to me at least) that he wanted vengeance, and Zeke was just a means to an end for him. The tables are turning non-stop though..."
StixnStones59,Kandoh,I'm reserving judgment until I see what he does
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,swbf_,"Absolutely fantastic episode. Eren is on demon time. I have a feeling that the three episode run from ‚ÄúTwo Brothers‚Äù to ‚ÄúFrom you, 2,000 years ago‚Äù will rival the return to Shiganshina run."

Elbeautz,MrMountainFace,"That entire sequence of events was incredible 

I still go back and watch those specifically every now and then"
Elbeautz,kurapikachu64,"I've noticed AoT has a lot of really crazy three episode runs.

Like episodes 5-7 in season one, 5-7 in season 2, 16-18 in season 3, 5-7 in season 4, and now 3-5 in season 4.

And you could definitely argue more, like 23-25 in season one, 10-12 in season 2, and 7-9 in season 3 just as a couple examples. Maybe it's because there are so many episodes of AoT that get crazy af it's inevitable that there will end up being a few sets of three of them in a row lol.

Edit: I'm also noticing that apparently episodes 5-7 are insane fairly often"
Elbeautz,krazybanana,"The last line of Warhammer titan. ""they're the devils of paradis"". One of the most chilling lines I've ever heard."
Elbeautz,blackashi,What push me to watch attack on Titan was the ridiculous number of highly rated IMBD episodes. I fully agree now. Holy shit man
Elbeautz,dotdotdotgov,this is already better
Elbeautz,Duty-Money,"The animation quality by mappa ruined it ngl. The early titan animations by mappa were quite bad imho.

Kbains01,TheChipiboy,"Fr. I think the animators put it on picture then the voice actor came in with his performance and the animators had to go back to the drawing board and go crazy with Grishas expressions.

Edit: a word"
TheChipiboy,Kbains01,Actually the lead facial animation director from death note helped with this ep that‚Äôs why the facial animations were exquisite

Eren in chapter 1 of the manga was napping and says [this](https://imgur.com/EtD1Byp) when he wakes up. Somehow, his dream involved present day Mikasa with her short hair.  I think next weeks episode is gonna end with Eren waking up in episode 1."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Forsaken-Currency404,"So help clear this doubt.

If Eren didn't persuade Grisha in the chapel, Grisha would not have gone through with killing children and stealing the founding titan?

(Coincidentally, it's funny that the two times Grisha had become complacent in his mission to save the Eldians, it was Eren both the times, Kruger first and Jaeger second, that lit a fire under Grisha and made him walk the story he started. They even have so many overlapping lines)

If yes, how then? Wouldn't it create the grandfather time paradox because if Grisha didn't eat the founding without Eren's persuasion, then Eren never inherited any titan and shouldn't be present to persuade Grisha."
Forsaken-Currency404,JournalistBrief3186,Yes. It is a deterministic Loop.
JournalistBrief3186,ShaidarHaran2,"I don't think it has to be, because it's avoiding time travel closed loop shenanigans through the memory insertions. The choice was made freely, but we're in the ""corrected"" timeline where these insertions have happened."
JournalistBrief3186,Money_Cookie3298,"But why Grisha let Eren inherit both titans? He literally told Zeke he saw Erens plans and ask him to stop him, before he gave Eren both titans. Why he gives them.whem he knowed it would lead to that? And why would Eren let him see that memory?"
Forsaken-Currency404,Semi_Square,"And both times Eren ended up saying, ""This is the story YOU started isn't it"" to Grisha. The callbacks in this show are simply amazing."
Semi_Square,Forsaken-Currency404,Exactly what I was referring to. There's not been a single episode which has failed to take my breath away at least once.
Semi_Square,yajCee,"When Grisha was being dropped on the island, The Owl told him to find someone within the walls, fall in love and start a family. He said that if he didn't do that, this hell would keep repeating itself over and over again. 

I think choosing to produce Eren is how he started this story."
Semi_Square,Legendver2,"Or maybe Jaeger influenced Kruger to say that, so really, both times it was Jaeger"
Forsaken-Currency404,RostLedditor,"Yeah it is a grandfather paradox, but that doesn't mean a grandfather paradox can't exist in the attack on titan reality. Basically it means in this timeline things were fixed - there wasn't really free will for Eren or the attack titan holders up to this point. Their actions were determined and manipulated."
RostLedditor,Forsaken-Currency404,"Darn you're right, that is how this paradox gets solved in this universe.

But for it to be, there's one more massive piece that needs to fit in the puzzle. The progenitor of the true attack titan. Because it can't be Eren who came after Grisha, and thus could never influence Grisha if he didn't get the attack titan. In other words, somebody else who inherited the Attack titan before Grisha willed for this happen, essentially setting in stone these events like Grisha stealing the founding."
Forsaken-Currency404,PabloEscobar_,How do we know kruger was also eren?
PabloEscobar_,Forsaken-Currency404,"His name was Eren Kruger?

I didn't mean that he was being controlled by Eren Jaeger. But again at this point, who knows if he was."
Forsaken-Currency404,Constant-Parsley3609,">Wouldn't it create the grandfather time paradox

You can argue that it's simply best not to think about it.


Or, it you really are bothered by the grandfather paradox assume that going back in time changes the future. Events play out, someone effects the past (making it so that things play out differently), in that new future someone changes the past, and on an fon until you eventually get a past and future that match. 


Maybe events previously played out differently, but still got even into this position, then he changed the past to make his position more secure and his new pasts self lived the life we see in the anime and once again changed events in the past to make his position even more secure."
Forsaken-Currency404,LezTalkz,"I‚Äôm still confused though‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt there a huge gap because of the loophole of past vs future? In the past Grisha didn‚Äôt end up going through with the murder, which means he probably died and Eren never received the attack titan. So if this never happened, how could future Eren possibly go back and change the future if the past dictates that Eren doesn‚Äôt receive the attack titan?

In short, Grisha not going through with killing the royal family would result in Eren never receiving the titan. Eren not receiving the titan would result in him not being able to convince Grisha to kill the royal family‚Ä¶.so how does it make any sense"
LezTalkz,Matilozano96,"A fixed timeline implies that there isn‚Äôt a timeline in which Eren doesn‚Äôt manipulate Grisha into killing the Reiss.

That always happened, and the result was always the same. The past didn‚Äôt change, just our perception of it as viewers.

The past can‚Äôt be changed, and any time traveller was there from the beginning. Any attempt to change the past (or the known future, for that matter), ends up causing that past."
Forsaken-Currency404,Shroffinator,"yeah it‚Äôs an instance of fate which is kinda depressing.

the alternative is that if another decision is made then it dissolves the current timeline as we know it until that point and branches off to create a new one."
Hampamatta,TheChipiboy,"This shit keeps fucking me up with all the different twists and turns. 


Reminds me about that Rick and Morty Episode"
much_morre,Matilozano96,"Eren‚Äôs surprise when he hasn‚Äôt control of Ymir in the last episode is genuine.

He has glimpses of the future, not the whole movie.

Sasha‚Äôs death, how to beat the Warhammer titan, Gabi shooting him are other things he didn‚Äôt know beforehand. He was genuinely surprised in those moments."
much_morre,lonetraveler206,I thought the shot when Eren sees Grisha asleep with Zeke and his mom was the moment he took control. Got the feeling he found something he could manipulate zeke with and went with it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,"remember when we said zeke played an uno reverse card last week? well, my boy eren just uno reversed and +5-ed mr monke"
amazingaida26,One-Bat7261,Eren just called uno and his last card is a +2 for Zeke
amazingaida26,Shiro83,"At this point Eren has a hand with all the reverse cards, the +4, +2, wilds, and the skips"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GutsyEddy,"The contrast between the brothers is staggering. Zeke was neglected and felt like a disappointment to his Father whereas Eren got the love and attention that Zeke never got. I‚Äôm glad that Zeke got to experience his Dad‚Äôs love and regret at the end, seeing those memories must‚Äôve been painful for him. 

That underground chapel scene was amazing. The rumbling sound effect in the background as Grisha argued with Frieda was almost symbolic of Eren‚Äôs boiling rage while Zeke on the other hand was calm and understanding of Frieda‚Äôs perspective of things. 

The true nature of the Attack Titan! So Future Eren influenced Grisha to steal the Founding Titan! What a plot twist, it was Eren all along, even when Kruger mentioned saving Mikasa and Armin! That must‚Äôve been Eren too! I almost feel bad for Grisha, it‚Äôs like he was a pawn in all of this."
GutsyEddy,Viilis,"In the episode Kruger is explaining everything to erens dad, krugers face is eren for like a frame.

@ 9min 45sec

https://youtu.be/FL3TX-FOUX0"
Viilis,v4zzy,"Yeah this is a good point, Krugers face is Erens face for a few seconds (when he‚Äôs explaining what the Attack Titan is called and it‚Äôs purpose) so it was probably Eren telling Grisha to save Mikasa and Armin. Nuts."
Viilis,moodytoon,I realized something when watching this clip again. Some of the things Kurger said to Grisha inorder to convince him were repeated by Eren himself in this episode (starting from 11mins 46sec) which I think further proves the theory. Man I will never find a show as good as Attack On Titan again.
Viilis,mitchcout,"‚ÄúThis is the story that you started‚Äù - Kruger to Grisha at 13:14 in that clip

‚ÄúThis is the story that you started, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù - Eren to Grisha in this episode

Eren has been manipulating him all along, probably through Kruger also. Im starting to feel really bad for Grisha."
GutsyEddy,matthieuC,"It feels like Grisha was just there to put things into place.  
In the end he had little agency in the matter."
matthieuC,Schwiftmaster,"I think legit every attack titan was there to put things into place to finally get to Eren, the point of convergence between the attack and founding titans. This legit changes the entire history that exists in AOT"
GutsyEddy,Javiercitox,"What I don‚Äôt get is that if Grisha saw the future and wanted to stop Eren after the massacre, why did he end up still giving him his shifter powers?"
Javiercitox,HanLeas,Because if Grisha doesn't give the attack titan to Eren then the Paradise will be destroyed and everyone on it will end up dead. He asks Zeke to stop Eren in the future events but he still needs Eren to save Paradise first.
Javiercitox,GutsyEddy,I was thinking the same thing! Perhaps he had no one else to entrust this mission to but his son so he had no choice or what we are seeing is the memory being slightly altered due to Paths Eren and Zeke being present.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AudaciousXII,"That was like 4 fucking minutes but Jesus fucking christ. Like my god is the attack titan probably the strongest titan. Also when it went to the intro I knew Eren is going to turn the tables. His fucking drive and hatred is freaky but god damn is my mind blown. No show has ever given me the feels or shock than AOT. So many different views we hate, The fritz, Willy tyburs, yelena, floch, zekes, Magath, and erens. Guessing the end will really just end with so much pain since no one is in the right. Jean,  hange, Levi, Armin, conny, and Mikasa are the only true protagonist. But the fucking paths like holy shit, eren was created by eren."
AudaciousXII,ShaidarHaran2,"> Also when it went to the intro I knew Eren is going to turn the tables. 

Yep. When he said next memory and Rumbling played I was like hooo boy, he has all the cards here doesn't he, we're in for a ride."
AudaciousXII,Jimmienoman,"Well, you could also consider it the weakest Titan as we see that it has little to no self will. Haunted by doing what the future Titan wills through brainwashing of memories. It truly is a bird trapped in a cage paradox 

Take Grisha for example. He lost two families because of him taking on the attack titan mantle along with killing many children to which he opposed. He was a tool, a pawn all because of the attack Titans power. 

Likewise the power can only send memories to the past from the future (meaning the present time attack titan could fully choose what to do with those memories) UNLESS all three are present : founding titan, royal blood in paths. 

When these three happen then the attack titan can interact with the people to whom the memories are sent to the past. This is the only time this power is at its apex"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tkv_is_pro,"* These CLIFFHANGERS man;  
These episodes last like 5 min istg. These episode cliff hangers are a form of torture unto themselves
* So, time travel. I was roughly spoiled there was going to be an element of time travel, but that is the extent to which I was spoiled, which left me in the difficult position of not being able to really post in the manga thread (for fear of more spoilers) or the anime thread (for fear of spoiling accidentally); Glad to finally reach here and finally be able to discuss this.
* This is what I gathered from this episode on how Attack on Titan will tackle time-travel:
   * After this episode with all the 'future memories' stuff and Eren essentially influencing decisions that ALREADY happened, I am convinced this version of time travel is the 'fixed' version as seen in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.   
Essentially, 'past', 'present', and 'future' mean nothing, because everything has happened, is happening, and will happen.
   * As opposed to the other 2 types of time travel:  
The one with the 'butterfly effect', where going back in time to effect a change in the past leads to a change in the future (e.g., films like Back to the Future) or,  
The one with the multiverse, where going back to the past and making a change will create a divergent timeline (e.g., films like Avengers: Endgame or the 'Future Trunks' arc in Dragonball Z).
   * Basically, Eren's viewpoint of time is less of a stream, and more of like a flat piece of paper with all the information already on hand. His perception is similar to Doctor Manhattan in Watchmen.
* The most surprising (and terrifying) thing in this episode though is Grisha's reaction/pleading to Zeke (ZEKE! of all people, esp. since Zeke wants to euthanize every Eldian, a goal that is fundamentally against what Grisha stands for as a nationalist) to stop Eren's plan. Makes me really wonder how terrible/awful Eren's endgoal really is; and also holy hell I am so curious/excited to see what Eren's real endgoal is now.
* And one more for the road, THESE EPISODES GO BY SO QUICKLY."
tkv_is_pro,QuietFanUser,Yeah this universe is deterministic so Eren doesn‚Äôt have freewill to not manipulate grisha there in time travel. So time travel is solved.
QuietFanUser,_kito,"He has free will, he simply didn't want to. Yes it already happened and he knows how it happens, but he still goes on with his plan. He goes forward. It's all his doing."
tkv_is_pro,asa2unakamura,Yes yes this reminds me of the film pre destination- erens seems to be on the same path the predestination paradox where changing the outcome becomes part of the circle. Thanks for the read.
tkv_is_pro,Barjuden,"Grisha's reaction made it seem like he really intends to just flatten the rest of the world with the rumbling and leave only Eldians remaining. I just have a feeling there's gotta be more to it than that, but I can't tell you what that is. Really excited for the rest of the show, obviously."
tkv_is_pro,TheDefinitionOfKek,That last note is so true. This episode went by in the blink of an eye! The preview for the next episode makes me wanna be in next sunday already.
tkv_is_pro,minimiemi,"Yea well obviously as the opening said rumbling is coming. But what i want to know is why does he want the rumbling to happen.
But what i believe from what he said in the end of season 3 p2 when he was at the water he questioned if they would be safe if he wiped his enemies on the other side.
So maybe in his own twisted way he‚Äôs doing it to protect his people"
tkv_is_pro,CoolAbdull27,"Its also incredibly morally ambigous, at one point was like founders speech was fd up and their is no way of justifying that but was totally understanding of why Grisha couldnt do after seeing those kids terrified faces but then those same kids urging Freida to casually toss away Grisha's life? Found myself saying what happens happened and will always happen, on the other hand I am like their must have been some other way right....?"
tkv_is_pro,ColdWar82,"I usually hate cliffhangers but god damn, this show utilizes cliffhangers like no other show. I spend the entire week thinking about the last episode and count down for the next one"
tkv_is_pro,murfsters,"This seems like an excellent summary. It doesn‚Äôt leave me wondering me confused though

I think your explanation is 100% correct, but I don‚Äôt really like it.
‚Äî‚Äîif it‚Äôs ‚Äúfixed‚Äù as you say, then what‚Äôs the point of Eren sending memories back anyways if you know what I mean.

If it‚Äôs fixed, then sending memories back or not won‚Äôt effect the future. 

At the same time, I know what you mean. Sending memories back IS part of that future and the past, it has to happen because it already has happened. 

But like, just because Eren showed Grisha some memories‚Ä¶that doesn‚Äôt mean he HAS TO do anything. Like I don‚Äôt see what stopped Grisha from just not feeding himself to Eren after he saw what the future looked like. I actualy find it as somewhat of a plot hole that he DOES feed himself to Eren, especially after telling Zeke to stop Eren. 

Sure, he HAS TO, as otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt be watching what we are watching rn, and Eren would never have lived this long to even send memories. But idk, it seems like a gimmicky and non sensical time travel ordeal. 

The statement that none of these guys have ‚Äúfree will‚Äù is stupid IMO because there truly isn‚Äôt anything stopping them from defying the memories they see excluding the fact that they see the memories themselves. 

Even typing this out makes it more difficult to comprehend."
tkv_is_pro,AMK2201,"You're on the right page. If you've seen Game of Thrones, it's basically like what the Three Eyed Raven says to Bran, which is actually very similar to this episode - 'the past is already written, the ink is dry'. Everything has happened for a reason."
tkv_is_pro,enough0729,"Yeah past, present and current coexist"
tkv_is_pro,littleallie99,Super helpful explanation!!!
tkv_is_pro,Caleb_u,The opening is eren's end goal lol
tkv_is_pro,Alizee918,"I can definitely infer Eren‚Äôs plans are not the same as Zeke‚Äôs.  He will not subject his people to a slow death, he does not feel him being alive in a punishment like Zeke does with himself. Where that will ultimately lead however, one can speculate. 

Also Grisha wouldn‚Äôt know Zeke‚Äôs plan (maybe)"
tkv_is_pro,realHyKo,"So my friend and I theorised a bit, and we came up with an idea:  
  
Eren HAS to be the last Attack Titan, because else someone over him in the hierarchy could have manipulated him, because the future attack titans pretty much control the past attack titans.  
  
That suggests that Eren has to somehow destroy the Powers of the Attack Titan, otherwise he would also be controlled by the next wielder of that power. Thus meaning, only the last wielder can be the manipulator, because everything a former wielder could've manipulated, would've just been canceled out by Eren if he wanted to."

Well, there is a bit of butterfly effect to this. They even hint at it in the OP when the Colossal steps on a person (I assume, from the blood puddle) and it changes from a giant footprint in the dirt to a shoe print stepping on a butterfly in the grass."
tkv_is_pro,swans183,I think Zeke might become the new protagonist! I hope so; his redemption would be quite something
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uniretamukcipusrm,"The way that Eren was so chill watching Grisha's memories like '' yeah yeah I've already seen all of this, let's move on ''"
uniretamukcipusrm,Nomaan_A,It was more like Eren showing Zeke without Zeke even realizing
Nomaan_A,Original-Ad4399,Eren showing Zeke what he was showing Eren who was showing Zeke..
Nomaan_A,GInfinity,"that would explain how Eren knew the memory about the King‚Äôs hideout‚Ä¶ Zeke didn‚Äôt know where it was, so probably didn‚Äôt bring about the memory himself"
uniretamukcipusrm,Page211,"I like how cheeky Eren was when he told Zeke 'yeah dude I'm totally on board with the euthanization plan this time for real I promise'.

Zeke was like 'no rush my dude', but boy is he in for the ride of his life"

Manga readers: yeah big deal, let's keep the story moving."
AMK2201,alien_from_earth012,"See, eren doesn't spoil. Learn from him."
uniretamukcipusrm,Kandoh,He did look back at his family once.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TimoorBTS,"Well that just took a turn...as soon as you think you knew AOT well by now,they throw this huge twist wow,so the attack titan can see the future(i guess we knida knew from krueger already)..Damn,Zeke went from thinking he was going to free eren from grisha to crying for his dad and fearing eren at the end,just how terrible the things grisha saw to tell Zeke save us from eren..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kbains01,It was insane to see the first kings vows overtake Frieda and see her entire personality change as she uttered the first kings words.
Kbains01,Page211,Yes! I'm so glad you noticed it because it definitely wasn't Frieda who uttered that words. Her whole demeanor changed before saying that
Kbains01,lehmx,"It‚Äôs all a matter of perspective, Eren is trying to save Eldians while the so called good guys like Zeke want to let them get exterminated and erased from history. The first king is the true villain of this story in my opinion, a weakling and a coward who chooses to sacrifice his own people because of his guilt."
Kbains01,Mv3tt,It's like the first king never died but is always there protecting the vow
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"Damn so there really isn‚Äôt free will in the aot universe then. Since anything the attack titan shifter can see will happen, that means everything is determined to happen that way. So since grisha saw eren carrying out his master plan, that means erens already won then, right? Guess we just gotta hope erens doing whatever he‚Äôs doing for a good reason"
Couch-Dogo,JustJerry_,I see it differently. I think it's more like eren was the first to realize and abuse that power. The the royal family said they didn't know there was anything special to the attack titan. Meaning others likely wouldn't have either.
JustJerry_,SageMidget,It‚Äôs hurting my head ü§£üòÇ
JustJerry_,Envy_onTHE_Toast,And possibly Grisha only knew because Eren used it to have him take the founding Titan
Couch-Dogo,TypicalPnut,"there is free will but Eren can only see things that he will see in the future, if his future self decides to reveal those to him....  This is going to get trippy.. But.. Future Future Eren sent memories back to Grisha.. Those memories are the ones Grisha was talking about at the end when he told Zeke to stop him.... When Eren ate Grisha, Grisha's memories eventually got revealed to Eren (Kissing Historia's hand).. SO, Season 3 Eren saw what Future Future Eren was going to do THROUGH the eyes of Grisha because originally, those memories were sent to Grisha, but now Eren had Grisha's memories.    So Eren has seen that future. He knows what he will do next episode. But he does not know details.


Time travel is strange in this story.  But basically just remember that Eren can not literally see the future.  He can only see memories that his Future self sends back to him.  If his future self withholds that information, he will not see it.   If his future self does not see something happen, neither will current Eren."
TypicalPnut,TypicalPnut,"But, at the same time, in this timeline, the past cannot be changed and things will always happen as they should.  So technically, yeah, not really free will. but also kinda. It's weird man"
TypicalPnut,Estelindis,"It feels like a paradox.  Past Eren has to do X because Future Eren sent the memory back.  But Future Eren *has to* send that memory back, because he remembers receiving it in the past.  But as with any of this timeloop stuff, it's probably only a paradox from the perspective of those of us who live in time.  If someone had an eternal point of view, everything would probably seem simultaneous, and thus every action (in theory) equally able to affect every other action, in the eternal present."
TypicalPnut,Kappa_Swaggins,"Can't tell if crazy theory, or manga spoiler.

I agree though, it isn't a deterministic universe, just one of heavy manipulation through time. Throughout the show, there have been examples of freedom being stolen, which Eren even referred to this episode. If someone is forced to do something such as via the Founding Titan, that isn't deterministic, it's manipulative or controlling. 
While AoT loves throwing curveballs at us, and twisting the plot into pretzels, the overall themes have remained consistent. With how much free will has been focused on in the show, and how fighting for freedom is worth any sacrifice, it doesn't seem consistent to suddenly have everything being set in stone from the beginning, and nothing ever matters. At least to me, those are two contradictory messages."
TypicalPnut,Starman926,My eyes glazed over 4 times trying to read this
TypicalPnut,Regression2TheMean,Fuck man I‚Äôm too sober for this
TypicalPnut,Chowdahhh,"Is Eren able to see his own memories from the future? I thought the Attack Titan let him see other Attack Titan users memories. So Eren can ""see the future"" but only through the lens of whoever comes after him's memories. Assuming that though my prediction is Eren doesn't see any future memories at all, so it adds to his mission to end the Titans"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CHEFKOCH38x,"Poor Grisha, Eren is a fuckin savage and i love it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Father_Mooose,You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Father_Mooose,AbanonPC,Eren has done all of the above
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sonofjupiteralt,"NO MANGA SPOILERS, Only Explanation  
So in order to avoid any confusion regarding the time travel mechanics, I will break down what type of Time travel we're dealing with here.  
  
AOT operates by a particular type of time travel where it's almost impossible to change the past even if you somehow go back in time. And any change that you tried to cause was always meant to happen in the overall timeline. Here time is a fixed circle, not a stream. We may see Eren meddle in the past but that was always meant to happen.  
  
The Attack Titan's ability is to receive the memories of its future inheritors. This was hinted when Kruger mentioned Mikasa and Armin towards the end of S3. Keep in mind, they can only view these memories but can't interact with them. So how was Eren able to meddle in the past?  
  
Well, he had 3 perfect conditions:  
  
‚Å†He had the ability of the Attack Titan  
  
‚Å†The ability of the Founding Titan  
  
‚Å†He was also in contact with someone with royal blood AKA Zeke.  
  
After Zeke tapped Eren's head, they were able to view Grisha's past memories with Eren using the power of the coordinate. They were freely able to view the past as if it were through a one way mirror.  
  
Now if Eren had any other Titan other than the Attack Titan, he would only be able to look. But since Attack Titan can see forward in time, Grisha can use this to see Eren's recollection of the same event that he's currently experiencing in real time.  
  
So this mean that whenever Grisha can see or hear Eren, he's actually recieving a brief future memory from Eren's POV where he can see out of his eyes and hear his words. That means he is seeing himself from a 3rd perspective. Then if he responds, his response is simply part of the memory that Eren/Zeke are viewing, allowing for a two way communication through time.  
  
Also Note that everytime, Grisha sees Zeke, Eren is always standing behind his dad. So whenever Grisha sees Zeke, it is from actually due to the memories from Eren's POV  
  
Another thing to add:  
  
Eren did NOT see everything in the future. Eren only saw CRUCIAL moments in the future, for example, he saw Pieck pointing a gun at him when he kissed Historia‚Äôs hand 4 years ago, this is why he was so calm when she threatened to shoot him, because Eren KNEW she wouldn‚Äôt shoot him. However, Eren DIDN‚ÄôT know that Porco was going to try to eat him just a couple of minutes later. Even Eren doesn‚Äôt know EVERYTHING that will happen"
sonofjupiteralt,xdyldo,"Excellent explanation thanks. So what's with the hug with Zeke at the end, just nothing?"
xdyldo,sonofjupiteralt,Eren just wanted to give something to Zeke I guess? so he gave Grisha a chance to say sorry for the last time
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kanna6501,Wtf just happened
Kanna6501,VeniceRapture,Zeke thought he was smart taking Eren through his dad's memories but he ended up letting Eren execute the most critical part of his entire plan lmao
VeniceRapture,TothaMoon2321,"How? I‚Äôm confused, I thought zeke had control through the memory sequence, I don‚Äôt get how wren can take that back"
Kanna6501,Saarthak8,RUMBLING! ITS COMING!!
Saarthak8,Agnostic_Pagan,#***BEWARE***
Kanna6501,_kito,"grisha saw future through eren, through eren's eyes, through eren's memories. All this episode he was seeing this as it happens in realtime, and what will happens in future (that eren knows of). He saw zeke as eren was seeing zeke.

Zeke has power of founding titan, can see past, eren has power of attack titan, can transfer his memories to past attack titans (or something like, idk honestly) so this special moment, eren could alter the past (it already happened), but grisha couldn't continue the mission, so eren interferes.

But you need to understand that grisha already killed royal family (leading up to current events)

Biggest takeaway of this episode was that eren knows what happens next, and he knew that for a long time, from the moment he saw grisha's memories

**E**: ~~kruger~~ -> grisha"
_kito,Page211,"Fun fact, when Eren say he is disgusted by his father's action in the cavern, he wasn't referring to the massacre. He was referring to how his father couldn't kill children to achieve Eren's goals üôÇ"
Kanna6501,Ehxdi,*So about that brainwashing...* look up that kruger and grisha clip talking about armin and mikasa
Ehxdi,supbitch,"I wonder if Eren is responsible for the whole ""the attack titan has never bowed to anyone"" thing.

Like imagine if long hair eren has straight up selectively sent memories to 2000 years of AT's to make them follow his path. He is the true Attack Titan."
Kanna6501,festival-papi,"Eren showed Zeke that he wasn't a pawn in Grisha's game, quite the opposite"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,i have decided i am not taking eren's nor zeke's side anymore and will be siding with my boy levi who never disappoints

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VeniceRapture,"Grisha says the Attack Titan can see the future but is that even the case? It's more like the future attack titan can show memories to the past attack titan. 

Grisha was yelling ""Why won't you show me everything Eren?!"". Guy probably didn't even know Carla was going to die. He thought what he did was going to save her"
VeniceRapture,ParticularOccupied34,"That's true. So Eren could see the future we haven't seen yet, but only if his future self sent those memories backwards to his Father and Eren saw Grisha's memories of Eren's future memories."
VeniceRapture,LurkyTheLurkerson,"I believe he specifically said something about wanting to know if Carla was safe, so yeah I don't think he knew Carla was going to die."
LurkyTheLurkerson,cheezzy4ever,"It seems to me that Eren deliberately kept that detail hidden to keep Grisha under his thumb. If Grisha knew that his wife was going to die, he'd have no motivation to do any of the horrible things Eren needed him to do, like wipe out the Reiss family"
VeniceRapture,sundownsundays,"Seems so. Which would mean Eren sent the memory of Armin and Mikasa to Kruger as well. And when he saw the future after touching Historian's hand, it was him sending those memories back to himself."
VeniceRapture,Twindo,I‚Äôm starting to believe nobody actually knows how tf Titans work and Eren is the closest to an expert.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JustJerry_,The part I loved most was when Zeke questioned if it was a lie that eren found his father's memory of the royal family disgusting... and the camera pans to erens pissed face. But in a way that's clear that he's not mad at grisha. He's mad at what the royal family was saying.
JustJerry_,kucafoia69,"Man, Eren's blood was boiling as Frieda was talking about the Peace Vow. She doomed her entire family by saying that."
KyeTheMovieGuy,Saarthak8,"Yeah, its really hard to pick a side now. However, I think Eren has already won because he must have seen the future."
No_Championship_5162,flashypotato998,"Yea‚Ä¶ not if you‚Äôre one of those people. 

I want Erin to burn them all."
No_Championship_5162,Zombiespire,Literal genocide rhetoric.
No_Championship_5162,Walthatron,"Except Marley, fuck Marley up"
No_Championship_5162,shitsfuckedupalot,I don't think you're seeing it from a Japanese enough perspective. Remember the they're the only people that have ever had a nuclear bomb dropped on them.
No_Championship_5162,GhostlyT,"it's a false dichotomy. idk if the author intended this but if we always cling to concepts/if we think concepts are stagnant then we're going to eventually always end up in genocide territory. 

eldians causing mass destruction is being pinned on their biology (they're hardwired to do it), rather than their social ideas. this is causing marley + the rest of the world to do the same thing the eldians did, and now the paradis eldians (eren yaegar types) are now pinning mass destruction on biology again. 

this is  seen in Willy Tybur and his mythmaking. He knows that the world is starting to unite against Marley, so he goes back to Marley's founding myth (eldians biology = mass destruction). 

it's a back and forth seesaw effect. aot would be wrapped up in 3 episodes if they had a sociologist."
No_Championship_5162,Classic_Reveal_3579,"Which makes it a numbers game, which means you're willing to negotiate the terms of genocide. 

The third option is peace."
Fernernia,NellyuWu,Zeke is not a good hearted person
Twindo,Page211,"I don't think it was Frieda's words coming out, you see before she uttered that she paused, her demeanor changed and she said those words. I think it was the first Eldian King's ideology that was imposed towards all their descendants that caused them to act this way."
x0midknightfire,Estelindis,"Perhaps.  But it looks like, for those hundred years at least, the average Eldians in the walls had a much happier life than than the average Eldian outside the walls.  Of course, that happiness was borrowed from future Eldians in the walls at a staggering rate of interest.  But in the cruel world they were living in, there could have been many other choices that would've led to a great number of people suffering.

One of the things I really like about Attack on Titan is that even when a choice is presented as a mistake, it's not black and white.  It's shown how the choice made at least some sense from the perspective of the person who chose it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fly_befalhavare,"This show just keeps finding new ways to blow my mind.

Holy shit. AoT is probably the best show in terms of providing new context to past events that just completely changes the whole framework of the whole show.

StarvedRock314,matthieuC,He didn't want to be convincing he knew what was going to happen and was a bit bitchy that it took this long.
StarvedRock314,Combat_Wombat23,I think he meant it to egg Zeke on until they reached the chapel. Then he could pull the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre stuck in here with me‚Äù and grab the wheel proper.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirSpits,I‚Äôm not sure I breathed that entire episode

ReallyColdMonkeys,DaughterOfIsis,"Lol

Erens plan = kill everyone on the face of the earth, probably some eldians in the process that get in the way of the colossal Titans

Zeke's plan = kill no one and just don't allow eldians to have children anymore, ending Titans.

ssann06,dotdotdotgov,same. on one hand zeke is right but on the other hand fuck it
ssann06,ISIPropaganda,Same
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"I‚Äôm just wondering what erens plan is. It seems to be way worse than just a full rumbling based of grishas reaction. Really starting to feel like he‚Äôs the final bad guy now. The big question is if eren can see the future, does he know if hes going to win or not?

Wonder if there gonna try push Zeke to be a good guy now? They‚Äôve done a lot to make him more likeable, and he might even move away from the euthanization plan now that he‚Äôs finally got the love of his father and understands more about eren. However I always remember how many survey corps members he‚Äôs killed and yeah it‚Äôs hard to move past that."
Couch-Dogo,geloraXO,"You can't even make the argument that ""he was just doing what he had to"", because he showed absolutely no remorse when he was doing it. The way he killed Miike was enough for me to hate him wholeheartedly, but his actions after that are inexcusable. He pretends to be the good guy who just wants peace, but laughs as over 100 soldiers charge to their deaths while shredding them with rocks. He claims to feel bad for Levi because of their difference in opinion, but taunts him saying ""what happened to your cute little subordinates"" after making Levi kill all of them. He's an absolutely sick hypocrite who only pretends to care about peace yet revels in killing those who he deems as ""brainwashed' by their own ideals, even though he's just as brainwashed as anyone else."
geloraXO,TheChipiboy,"Yeah he's the only character in here that I haven't had a change of heart for. I love our guys, Pieke, Reiner and even Gabi, but never will I root for Zeke. The shit he did to the scouts and Erwin was disgusting not to mention poisoning paradise with his fluid to make them weapons. Fuck Zeke."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,David0nsky,"I like how the episode started with Zeke believing Grisha was manipulating Eren , but it was Eren who manipulated Grisha."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheChrisLambert,"GET THIS

In the very first episode, little kid Eren is just sleeping under a tree when he suddenly gets visions of a bunch of stuff that will happen, including Dina eating his mom. Mikasa asks him why he‚Äôs crying.

So even before becoming a Titan, Eren‚Äôs seeing memories of the future."
TheChrisLambert,GLOaway5237,And then there‚Äôs falco in s4 episode one talking about ODM gear.... soooo falco attack Titan confirmed or something else going on?
GLOaway5237,Difficult-Tension-23,"Ymir was also a part of Survey Corps so it just could be her past memory, right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hottytoddy098,"Eren is the man who‚Äôs willing to bloody his own hands to ensure the salvation for his friends and for Paradis. 

To defeat monsters, you have to become one yourself. To save humanity, you must lose your own.

Amazing how that‚Äôs come full circle. Go, Eren. Paradis should be thankful Eren is there to protect them. Who else would have the mental fortitude to do this?"
hottytoddy098,x0midknightfire,"I was thinking of that conversation that Armin had with Jean too, I think it was after they captured Annie in Stohess. I was more thinking of when Jean said something along the lines of ‚Äúwell if we have to become monsters to win then maybe we deserve to lose.‚Äù I‚Äôm still more on Eren‚Äôs side but it was just something I was thinking about."
hottytoddy098,sendnudibranchia,"Eren seems like the complement to Aang from ATLA. While both possess immense power with the heavy burden of saving humanity, Aang is unwilling to compromise his values to kill the fire lord, whereas Eren is willing to set aside his own morality for the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù, it seems. I find both characters to be intriguing and Im enjoying Eren‚Äôs development. Excited to see how it ends"
hottytoddy098,Page211,"I still think future future Eren showed Eren Mikasa and Armin's salvation, which led Eren taking all these drastic actions because he knows at the end of the day, the people mattered most to him will survive. And he will do it, no matter the cost and pain inflicted on others."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,666JFC666,We pretty much already knew the Attack Titans saw each other's memories from the episode where Kruger made Grisha the Attack Titan and started talking about Mikasa and Armin
666JFC666,Kandoh,Yeah but this really showed the extent of what that means
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TimeTravelingYams,Eren really pulled the strings in this show like few ever have. The man is playing 4D chess

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gm1504,"So eren is the master mind behind everything, that was awesome."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rivenite,"We need a rendition of ‚ÄúAgatha All Along,‚Äù but with Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VeniceRapture,"I know this episode was supposed to paint Eren as the bad guy, and I'm not saying that he didn't do something fucked up but basically Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie were still going to destroy the Walls regardless of what Grisha did. At some point Zeke was still gonna show up in Paradis and kill everyone


If Grisha didn't take the Founding Titan, when shit hits the fan everyone's memories were going to get reset and the Marleyan invasion would've gone as planned because Armin wouldn't have the Colossal Titan to blow up their navy. 


Grisha taking the Founding was the only way out. He shouldn't have killed the children though, even if that would have complicated things"
VeniceRapture,matthieuC,Not sure what was the point of killing the kid if he let the father go.
matthieuC,RaZoX144,"That was Rod Reiss, he let him go so that he can meet Historia and the events in Season 3 (the cave) can happen"
VeniceRapture,RiceBurnerBoy,"A better way to phrase it than painting Eren as the bad guy, is that this episode makes you question who is in the wrong. Who is the villain? Who is doing the right thing? At this point in the story, you're wondering which side to take during the final arc: Zeke, the Yeagerists, the Marleyans, the Scouts, etc."
VeniceRapture,Agentloldavis,I think there's still some memories you haven't seen to get to that conclusion
Agentloldavis,VeniceRapture,"Marley would have attacked either way though right? Plus the entire reason Paradis only saw that invasion coming was because Grisha wrote about the outside world in his journal and hid it in his basement. If Frieda still had the founding titan, the survey corps would have been memory wiped and forget that basement even existed."
Agentloldavis,JustJerry_,No? He's entirely correct (minus killing the kids doe. Fuck dem kids).
Agentloldavis,thatscoolm8,Are we getting more memories?
VeniceRapture,Apoptosis89,"But the declaration of war on Paradis at the start of this season was mainly because the Founding Titan had been stolen, and since the royal vows no longer bind it, the world is once more in danger? So if Grisha didn't take the Founding Titan, things could have continued like they had been.

&#x200B;

I don't know if Paradis would have been attacked eventually by other countries."
Apoptosis89,Tymptra,"I think one of the ideas is that every country suffered due to the Eldians of the past, and with technology developing to the point that Titans, even colossals, might not be a threat in the near future, the other countries will be able to attack them. As another commenter highlighted, Paradis has a bunch of natural resources, and the Eldians past crimes would be a perfect justification to attack and destroy them for said resources."
Apoptosis89,VeniceRapture,No that was just the public justification of the invasion. Marley recognizes it can't keep depending on the titans forever to secure military dominance and Paradis is home to a lot of fossil fuels and that was ultimately what they were after.
VeniceRapture,ShaidarHaran2,"ngl I'm still Team Eren almost all of the way through seeing him play the villain so far lol   
 
 
Terrible things were done, maybe will be done, but the circumstances were terrible, the world was terrible. Still have to see what his master plan really is."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdeQ217,"Holy shit, how does the timeline work here? Grisha got the Founding Titan because Eren forced him to and then Grisha gave it to Eren who forced Grisha to get the Founding Titan while he was visiting his memories? Also why did Grisha see Zeke and Eren? Wtf. Eren is actually terrifying now, when Grisha begged Zeke to stop him and the camera cut to Eren I was genuinely scared. These episodes are too short ffs, I want to know more."
AdeQ217,ounage,"Grisha sees Eren's POV, through memories (of the future) that Eren conveniently sends to him. Which is why he can't see Eren, but only his own self and Zeke.

If you look closely, Grisha can only see Zeke when Eren is looking in their direction. So after the mess at the chapel, Grisha gets a memory from Eren's POV and uses it to see himself hug Zeke. Not sure if that's clear, but there's [a nice post that recaps it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/sgg9au/if_you_watched_the_new_episode_and_need_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ilesial,"Season 4 Eren is fwine.

Like come destroy my walls."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jediwizard7,"Hmm can Eren see into his own future? Does he already know how the Rumbling's going to go down?

Or maybe he only knows that he's the last attack titan. Because he can't see farther into the future, he must be the end of the line, meaning he must be the one to end it. O\_O"
jediwizard7,RostLedditor,The only reason he can tell Zeke to stop Eren is because Eren already has the attack titan which means he knows he can't stop giving it to Eren. So something must happen to compel him or force him maybe.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pardusco,"Eren is scaring the shit out of me. All I can think is ""who are you?"" 

One thing I noticed about the scene where Eren tells Grisha why he wants to join the Scouts, Grisha can see the determination in Eren's eyes and it frightens him. He probably knew at that point that Eren would become the next Attack Titan!

I really like how the King's vow in Frieda allowed her to have an actual conversation with Grisha. It really shows how King Fritz forced his descendants to hold back from fighting, even in tense situations like this, contrary to Reiss and his children who were yelling at Frieda to kill Grisha. Even when Grisha was about to transform, but couldn't because he refused to harm children, Frieda paused and did not bite her hand. It also shows how conflicted Frieda was about the injustice done in the past as well as in the present. Sure, the Eldians devastated the outside world, but it's not fair to condemn these innocent people to the same fate. Unfortunately for her, her opinion on this matter was already made for her. 

Another interesting thing to note is Grisha revealing the true power of the Attack Titan regarding its refusal to bow down to the king. They opposed the self righteousness of the king. What I *really* want to know is how did the Attack Titan manage to hide out in Marley for so long without being stolen?! How did the knowledge of the Attack Titan's ability to see into the future remain hidden, even from the Founding Titan?! Were all of these events orchestrated by the original holder of the Attack Titan?! When Frieda says she was never aware of the Attack Titan's ability, Grisha responds with ""I knew you weren't aware of that, too."" That means someone must have given him this information regarding the knowledge that the royal family has about the Attack Titan! The Attack Titan is honestly the most mysterious entity of the show, despite being so familiar."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cop-graveyard,"I was literally screaming and crying whole episode, absolutely crushed that we have to wait another week to see wtf happens next !!!!!  Want to read the manga so bad but I'd prefer to wait til the series ends at this point"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,i uhhhhh...holy shit????
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ColmanTallman,"This episode gives the line ‚Äúbecause I was born into this world‚Äù so much more meaning. I used to take it as Eren‚Äôs way of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive and therefore can‚Äôt help my desire to live.‚Äù But this episode confirming a predestined timeline loop changes the meaning of that quote. 

Eren never had a choice - he‚Äôs always made these choices and always will. He does the things he does because that‚Äôs how they‚Äôve always been. If he was in a different timeline or if circumstances were different, maybe he would be too. But he was born into THIS world. And because of that, he always has and will make these choices. 

‚ÄúBecause I was born into this world.‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fake_the_jaB,I just wanted to suggest another show that gives me the same vibes as AOT. The show is called ‚ÄúDark‚Äù and it‚Äôs the only show I‚Äôve seen that gave me the same feelings as watching yesterday‚Äôs episode‚Ä¶just throwing that out there for people looking for other stories similiar to AOT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Program-Mysterious,"I don't belive eren ""manipulated"" grisha, more like fiercely motivated. Plus I'm a little confused that grisha told zeke to stop eren because in S1 we know grisha told ere  to master the attack titan In order to save mikasa and armin"
Program-Mysterious,junko_kv626,"Agreed, I‚Äôm really confused as to why Grisha told Eren to stop. ‚ÄúMikasa‚Äôs life. Armin‚Äôs life. Everything rests in your ability to control this power!‚Äù (I might have paraphrased.)
Also, mind = blown."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"This is so interesting because how are they going to explain grisha‚Äôs decision to make eren into the attack Titian as a child. He says zeke needs to stop eren, but he could‚Äôve been the one to do it by not injecting him."
Johnny20022002,RiceBurnerBoy,"Grisha's only hope of saving Eldia was through Eren. Grisha has already been shown the future by Eren. No matter what he does, Eren has already set in stone what happens. Grisha *must* give Eren the Attack & Founding Titan. As Eren said earlier in the episode, he would rather take other people's freedom away than have his own freedom taken. He does this to his father, who has no will of his own to stop Eren. At this point in the story, Grisha begs Zeke, who is with the ""present-day"" Eren, to stop him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zombiespire,"This is why I watch the anime also. Seeing Eren's anger and disgust in hearing the First King's self race hating bs that the Eldians should have to ""atone"" for crimes they never committed against people they never met or even knew existed. That's the first time in a while we've ever seen Eren be like so disgusted and angry on a physical level. That along with Grisha's episode he had leaving the church, the emotion of him apologizing to Zeke and regretting the past, all those tears come through so much better here in that moment. Just hits SO different than the manga.

If hearing the First King's demented self hatred rhetoric through Frieda didn't hit you with a truck of epiphany and turn you into a Grisha Jaegerist right there and then, it's hard to say anything will. ***Born into this world***"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Admirable_Branch_221,"Eren is like, ‚ÄúGrisha traumatized you and I traumatized Grisha. We are not the same.‚Äù Lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MonsterCookies8,Eren's playing 5D chess with multiverse time travel
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IceBre4th,grisha va woke up and choose to do one of the best voice acting in anime
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cp710,"So what‚Äôs happening is basically the theory that didn‚Äôt pan out that people had about Bran on Game of Thrones. That he went back and made history happen, even being Bran the Builder who built the Wall. Cool."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wallen3,Eren said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm like that‚Äù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,emergencyambulance,"Fantastic episode, having Eren manipulate Grisha was beautiful storytelling. I guess the Rumbling is confirmed now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Prof_Black,Eren is literally the definition of by any means.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fahiem123,‚ÄúFuck them Kids‚Äù Michael Eren Jordan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fimbres16,"I went back to watch Grisha‚Äôs and Kruger‚Äôs conversation and so many parallels. 

‚ÄúStand up and fight‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can only move forward, until death even after death‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone down the line can be watching this‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Beverly2696,"I finally understand the ending:
In the ending credit Eren is holding a knife and then blood drops on the flower. I didn‚Äôt get it (I‚Äôm an anime only watcher) 

So I thought it was him as a child killing the bad guys to save Mikasa (because he‚Äôs still wearing the scarf), but I remember he didn‚Äôt use that. So my next theory was that it‚Äôs a meaning of how he will need to kill many people and it all started with that night and why the flower is stained in blood (innocence is gone)

Now that this episode dropped it makes sooooooo much sense. Eren is holding the same knife Grisha had when he was going to stab himself to kill the Reiss family! 

So in reality if you really think about it, it was Eren who killed the Reiss family. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs holding the same knife Grisha had in this episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ahmad45123,Imagine Eren is the one controlling Isayama to write Attack on Titan hehe
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hollandaise87,"So when Eren said he saw the memories of his dad eating the Founder and it made him feel sick, it wasn't actually because of the slaughter. It was because his dad was trying to back down and not carry out the plan and his weakness made Eren sick."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jawdyhighroller25,"Literally the craziest thing to me is when Zeke told Eren about how he said he was disgusted by his fathers actions in this moment & then he realizes he wasn‚Äôt disgusted by his dad killing them, he was disgusted at how weak his dad was so he had to push him to murder them all. Eren smokin on that royal family & grisha pack"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrippedoutErin,I love how as soon as Erin tells Zeke ‚Äúnext memory‚Äù the power dynamic totally shifts
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Prestigious_Bank9428,"There are few characters in all of fiction that makes me as repulsed and terrified as Eren. The most famous classic villains are actually pretty chill people compared to him, if a bit control freak. But Eren? He's the person who's willing to obliterate anyone and anything that stands in his path of unending vengeance. He's the worst possible person to hold any power, and unfortunately he now holds almost 'all' the power. I doubt Zeke would be able to stop him, because he's too compassionate, ""too soft"" for the task, and compassion cannot stand it's ground against Eren's ruthlessness."
Prestigious_Bank9428,ch0k3,I love Eren for the same reason you are disgusted by him. He's a HERO that will stop at nothing to save his race.
ch0k3,Prestigious_Bank9428,"Which includes killing over half of his own race too apparently (more than half of the eldians live outside of Paradis), and if the Rumbling will indeed commence, they‚Äôll be annihilated alongside the rest of the world. That‚Äôs quite the opposite of ‚Äúsaving your race‚Äù, that‚Äôs nigh-omnicide with a select few survivors who happen to be on a tiny island."
Prestigious_Bank9428,ounage,"You know, it's been hard for me to decide who I was rooting for in the end. But seeing Gabi  standing there in tears after losing Falco, Colt and Galliard, I was somehow super relieved when she shot Eren.

Reiner, Galliard, Pieck and Magath felt more legit than Eren and Zeke during last week's episode. Probably just because they're trying to prevent a nuclear bomb to go off."
Prestigious_Bank9428,Samus_Ripley,"Eren is actually the good guy. There's no compassion in willing to sterilize his own race for the sake of a fascist nation like Marley. Eren got all his powers for the best, it's a great chance for people of Eldia to be freed and teach Marley a well deserved lesson."
Samus_Ripley,Prestigious_Bank9428,You didn‚Äôt listen to anything I said before did you? You didn‚Äôt even read the manga properly if you believe anything you just wrote.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,theholyheathen94,I don't care what anybody says I still back Eren if the world didn't wanna get destroyed then maybe they shouldn't of done his people so dirty. Yeah he's not taking the hero's high road and I don't blame em
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Agnostic_Pagan,"ITS TIME!

I kinda hope Annie shows up this episode.

Edit: No Annie, but awesome episode with TIME TRAVEL."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wingo21,"Going by Eren words ""if someone tries to take away my freedom I take their freedom instead"", I suspect his plan is to literally massacre everyone out of the walls with the rumbling, which would make Grisha telling Zeke to stop Eren logical I guess.

What a fucking masterpiece of an episode, how is it possible that this series has been able so many times to create plot twists that completely change the perspective on the whole series? 

Now we learn that the attack titan can see the memories of future holders of the titan, which means that Eren could see the future all along.

Grisha and the attack titan before him, even Zeke, all pawns in his game. Absolutely insane. 

Masterpiece"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SuperSpread,"Just want to repost this for everyone: the Attack Titan power is NOT the power to see the future. It is the power to receive chosen future memories - i.e. the power to send memories back in time to itself. Even the Owl got memories of Armin and Mikasa and immediately said out loud he had no clue why he was being given the memory but was just blindly passing it on to Grisha.

Past Eren had no power to select future memories to see. Future Eren selected every memory for past Eren to see as well as when he would see them - including when he saw the royal family massacre in season 3 after kissing Historia's hand. See his reaction. This is when Eren knew he was actually the one responsible for killing them  
https://youtu.be/hrfYjhnP9E8

In fact at 13:50 you can see Eren is literally controlling Kruger like a puppeteer.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL3TX-FOUX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL3TX-FOUX0)

On that scene on the wall, it was Eren speaking directly to his father, not Kruger. He then repeats some of those lines in this episode.

The show has never once allowed an Attack Titan to 'grab' a future memory. Grisha literally begged future Attack Titan to show him more. So Eren manipulated Grisha into murdering the royal family, thinking it was the only way to save Carla - sike. The Attack Titan can only send memories back in time!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clockbone25,zeke he realizes that the shows called attack on titan and not beast on titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"I just wanna put it out there that I called the attack titan being able to see the future for ages no and no ones believed me. Feels nice to finally be confirmed on that fact.

God tho the realisation that eren made his father kill all those people is horrifying, I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd go that far. Also since eren controlled his father like that, maybe he‚Äôs been doing it with other attack titan holders? Influencing people like Kruger as well? How far back does it go?

Edit: apparently more people thought the same about the attack titan seeing the future than I thought lol. Whenever I used to bring it up people always said either 1:‚Äùall titan shifters can do it, we just haven‚Äôt seen the other do it‚Äù or 2:‚Äùit‚Äôs not seeing the future it‚Äôs just eren mixing up his memories‚Äù. I think that we can all agree that these arguments are pretty stupid tho now."
Couch-Dogo,Johnny20022002,"I said it last week when I brought up the owl mentioning mikasa and armin, but then someone told me that wasn‚Äôt right. How the turntables"
Johnny20022002,Couch-Dogo,"Exactly how I feel dude, weeks of people‚Äôs telling us were wrong only for us to turn out right"
Couch-Dogo,ReallyColdMonkeys,I thought this was pretty common knowledge since Kruger mentioned Armin and Mikasa who hadn't even been born yet before giving the Attack Titan to Grisha... People really aren't paying attention.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,XPrecision2937,Oh shit. Look how the turntables have turned.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,unqualifiedromantic,"AOT manages to have almost an entire episode devoted to talking and keep me intensely interested. Towards the end when Grisha hugged Zeke was emotional and that last moment tho. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!

Also, I must say that Eren looks cool af this episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jusaturt,"That was incredible. My brain still hasn't fully been able to grasp the implications of everything happening in this show, but this storytelling is really on another level in so many ways. I'm also high right now so this is gonna be rambly.

Where to start? My first time through the episode felt like being wacked over the head with so many plot revelations, moments of emotion, disgust and amazement that it was difficult to absorb. Immediately after it ended, I rewinded and watched the episode again. I'm about to rewatch it once more once I get some thoughts out.

There's so much complexity in this story, with so many different themes, narrative reframings, character motivations, and now time travel rules (which I'll touch more on later) that it's kind of mind-blowing how much.. plot, has been packed into these 80 episodes. But what's so fucking nuts about it all is that it's remained incredibly consistent. Attack on Titan has always felt like Attack on Titan, despite the fact that Attack on Titan feels like a thousand different things in one show. There's a scale and a depth to this thing that trump's anything else I've read, watched or played. The clashing ideologies are so interesting. The constant plot twists NEVER feel cheap, despite the fact that on paper it seems like they should. That's what impresses me most about this show.

I also am really growing to appreciate that Attack on Titan does not hold the hand of the viewer. It presents this story to you, and allows you to make sense of it all, in both the morals of its characters, and also it's internal logic (specifically the time travel rules and the powers of the titans.) My first time through the episode, I didn't realize that Grisha can't physically see Eren. I had to piece together for myself with a rewatch that when Eren kisses Historia's hand, he is seeing Grisha's memories of Future Eren, and that Grisha is seeing Eren's memories of watching him in the paths. Piecing that together for myself makes it feel so much more earned and rewarding than if the show had just outright explained it to me in an exposition dump. And even though I didn't quite get that on my first watch, it in no way hampered the experience. My disgust at Eren, Grisha's mental breakdown, Zeke and Grisha meeting again... It was a rollercoaster of emotions only made possible by careful buildup.

I fucking love this show. Everyone should watch it. I want to write up a more in depth analysis in the future."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ComfortableReason796,"I‚Äôm with Eren. Eren told Zeke it was a waste of time showing the memories. Zeke still thinking that it was all Grisha‚Äôs fault proves he is a novice at understanding it all. Maybe Eren really IS doing things for the betterment of everything, he isn‚Äôt blinded by memories when he can change them. Maybe I‚Äôm reading into this completely wrong though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,XTGENZ,"What fucked me up the most was that Grisha saw Zeke, all grown up, HUGGING HIM AND SAYING TO STOP EREN.

That just really blew my mind how this is all connected, the past, the present and the future..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TJNimNums,From the teaser at the end it looks like we're actually going to see the Great Titan War. How is nobody else talking about that?? I'm so hyped
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sawinnz,"I can‚Äôt even remember half the shit that happens in this show, but wow. This show is fucking insane. 

I love it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zaher9,So how tf eren is now the one who controls the founding titan?
zaher9,AbaramaGolding,"Eren has the founding Titan. Zeke has the royal blood.

Eren was always supposed to control the founding titan power. Zeke was stuck in the paths for years, so he thought he found a loop hole (because he had royal blood Ymir followed him) ."
zaher9,666JFC666,What do you mean? His dad ate the founding Titan
zaher9,Diavolo__,"yeah, I need an answer for this one"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shisuka,"I‚Äôm only just to the opening but I swear if Zeke‚Äôs whole purpose of sterilization is rooted in daddy-issues because he felt that he was unwanted and unloved and he doesn‚Äôt want other children to feel the same, I will slap him.

Edit:

Just finished. Oof, that was a great episode. Slower than the last few but a lot to take it and unpack. Uh. Eren though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoosySucker69,"Wait , it's all Eren Yaeger!!
Always has been."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Siegfriedchicken122,"So far all I‚Äôm seeing is this

Eren is a walking paradox. He is so obsessed by freedom and wanting to be free that he‚Äôs become a slave to a set path. Since touching historia and seeing the future he‚Äôs become stuck on one path. This renders him to become the least free person in the show minus ymir. It‚Äôs ironic really, his passion to free the world has made him a villain intent on destroying it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,adityapatcher26,"So how many plot twists do you want?

Isayama: YES"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LavenderScented_Gold,"It‚Äôs crazy how Zeke always wanted a father who wanted him and latched on to Mr. Ksaver. He seems to wants to be a replacement father to Eren as well but doesn‚Äôt want other Eldians to ever be fathers. And yes, Zeke needed that hug and Grisha needed to give it. 

Eren‚Ä¶..man. Who TF am I supposed to be backing? Is alllll this he‚Äôs doing just for Mikasa and Armin. I guess I‚Äôll just keep watching."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MapleLeafBeast,That episode legitimately felt like it was five minutes long holy shit. Incredible episode. One of the best of the whole series.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,potato_crip,"There's no telling how far this goes back, now that we know Eren Jaeger can manipulate the actions of past Attack Titan Wielders, it can be argued that he forced The Owl to choose Grisha as his inheritor. That would explain why he knew Armin and Mikasa's names despite them not being born at the time."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VlBE-CHECK,This show just pulled an Interstellar
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ghost18867,"Damn so over a three week period we went from ""Eren's the villain"" to "" ahh he was just playing all along"" to ""Damn this guy's a God damn monster""

Also, I wonder when Annie is gonna wake up. How many episodes are left? 4?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vyrnius,"yeah, that's it. I won't watch any new AoT episode... at least till all episodes are streamed

I simply can't deal with waiting 7 days for watching only 20mins of this masterpiece..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KasenPringle,"Something that a lot of people don‚Äôt realize is that Eren knows HIS OWN FUTURE MEMORIES. He can see Grisha‚Äôs memories of looking into Eren‚Äôs future memories. From the moment of holding Historia‚Äôs hand, he knew egos exactly everything was going to play out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"Dude I'm so fucking confused and blown away at the same time.

So what I can determine, the Attack Titan can pass down memories to those who came before.  To me, this would mean that originally, Grisha must have passed on the Attack Titan to Eren, who must have seen some terrible future, and thus influenced Grisha in the past to not only take the Attack Titan, but also take the Founding Titan, so that Eren would then inherit both.  That's the only way I can see them get out of the paradox of Eren needing to initially persuade Grisha in the first place.

So Eren may actually be the bad guy after all?  And if everything that's happened has been influenced and predetermined by Eren through passing down information through the years... then he must also have known about Zeke's whole ""vow loophole"" and passed that down and prepared for it.  I need some sort of recap episode that pieces together all the important bits and pieces from over the seasons to help me grasp everything that's been passed down and influenced.

Also, I still want Eren to eat all other Titans and become some **Mega Titan**.  I want some huge, furry, armored, angry Titan that runs around on all fours with a bone jaw that can summon Titans and summon spikes and weapons.  And also has boobs I guess."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hellofriendimwatchng,Eren rlly be controlling eveything. its crazy how Grisha was able to see eren too. like when he was leaving the house he is looking straight into erens eyes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turtloblade,"Holy crap, Zeke was playing 3 dimensional chess while Eren was checkmating the 4th dimension."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nrv923,this mf eren went from being the bad guy to the good guy then back to the bad guy in three episodes lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seraiss,How many episodes are left ?
seraiss,klaygotsnubbed,"8 left, not sure why the other dude said 12"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dare_unusual,how did grisha talk to zeke. how did eren talk to grisha
dare_unusual,cybersidpunk,so basically attack titan can send memories into the past and eren sent memories of him and zeke into the past where they are speaking. grisha is just talking alone all the time but he sees the future memories sent by eren.
dare_unusual,thegirlofravens,"Grisha only sees Zeke through eren's view so whenever Eren stands behind Zeke, only then does grisha see Zeke."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,icannotbebothered7,"When eren was telling grisha to go ahead with it, is this what he saw when he kissed Historia‚Äôs hand? There was a lil clip in there of that moment and I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs finally answering what he saw."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lord5678,Eren has just ascended man he's asserting dominance on someone who has godlike powers like it's nothing.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Artistic_Way_6579,It‚Äôs nice to learn why Eren has had BDE this season
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sadgurlsays,"After doing a rewatch prior to this finale, I‚Äôve realized how much foreshadowing is used in the story. I‚Äôm not going to pretend that I think I know what happens next, because I‚Äôve never even been close when it comes to AOT. However, they‚Äôre setting up a pretty solid stage for Eren to be the ultimate villain. This episode he says he‚Äôs been this way since birth, and that he wants to essentially destroy others before they have the chance to take away his freedom. Not to mention how the first part of this season was from the Marley warrior‚Äôs perspectives‚Ä¶It may seem like Eren is a hero initially for what I‚Äôm assuming will be genocide in the episodes to come, since he is saving Eldia. But it‚Äôs all about perspective in this show. We‚Äôve always seen Eren turn his violence against conveniently ‚Äúevil‚Äù characters. But now that he has the power to essentially ‚Äúflatten‚Äù the world and all of the Marley characters we‚Äôve been introduced to, the script may be flipped on whether he‚Äôs a hero or a villain. I FUCKING LOVE IT."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mo_047,I think this is the greatest attack on titan episode of all time. But knowing what happens next after reading the manga I'm probably gonna say the same thing next week.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tddammo1,"Anyone else have this literally break you? It took me a solid 30 minutes to realize:

The attack titan sees the memories of future holders. 

Zeke is the one who initiates going through the memories

As a result there is zero lag between Eren telling these guys what to do and them seeing the future Eren telling them what they need to do. 

Eren didn't lie. His father was wrong. And I'm also now broken."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lakeland234,THE ATTACK TITAN‚ÄôS POWERS ARE SO UNDERRATED HOLY SHIT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mas-sive,Reading all the reactions for anime watchers is awesome.  My head was messed up after reading the manga chapter.  And it‚Äôs even better than I expected after watching the ep.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,somalipilates,"Why isn't anyone talking about Grisha saying he has a daughter.

Initially he said children, but then he specifically states daughter. Is it Mikasa?"
somalipilates,PabloEscobar_,"Yeah, i think it‚Äôs Mikasa. I actually thought it was nice touch that he considered Mikasa his daughter."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hottytoddy098,"Question for all of us:

If you could go back in time and stop all the suffering that has ever happened to you, would you?

Follow up: what if you had an enemy threatening every person you love in the present, and to defeat the enemy you had to ensure all your past suffering had happened. Would you still go back and change it?

I feel like that dilemma is 100% what just happened with Grisha and Eren. The suffering he‚Äôs putting on his father/himself is horrific, but Eren knows that if he doesn‚Äôt make sure it happens, then Grisha won‚Äôt give him the Attack Titan, and Eren won‚Äôt be in the position he is today. 

What do y‚Äôall think? What would you do? This is S tier writing damn."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Costa_Rican_GOD,Eren knows how I will react after the final episode before I even have the feeling. What a season so far. One of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TequilaKid98,I‚Äôm still rooting for Eren
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ancient_Mai,"Zeke: I'm the one controlling you.

Eren: *Mangekyo Sharingan*"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Taraklana,"Anime only, dobt know if someone will answer by this time but, did zeke not know his aunt was eaten by dogs, the anime shot when eren tells his father to get up for his sister getting eaten by dogs is interrupted to show zeke surprised reaction, and then eren tells geisha about his dead comrades.
So did zeke not know his aunt was eaten by dogs?"
Taraklana,Johnny20022002,"Zekes reaction before this is that he‚Äôs confused why grisha is hesitating to kill the royal family. He knows the future can‚Äôt change so how is it that grisha isn‚Äôt killing them. That‚Äôs when he sees eren is the one telling grisha to kill them. So he‚Äôs shocked by the fact that eren was the one who caused grisha to kill them. 

Not sure if zeke knew, but I‚Äôd be surprised if he didn‚Äôt considering how much grisha did to convince him to restore eldia.  I want to say he did I just can‚Äôt think of a specific scene where it‚Äôs implied he was told."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rayk10k,"So Grisha had a memory of him killing the royal family, but he didn‚Äôt know what actually compelled him to do it until he had actually lived that moment, which is why he said ‚Äúthis is where I end the royal bloodline‚Äù, but didn‚Äôt go through with it at first UNTIL Eren shows up and pushes him into doing it.

And why he asks eren while kneeling in the grass ‚Äúwhy won‚Äôt you show me everything‚Äù 
The level of depth the memory-time travel stuff has is crazy."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nyarlathotepisyummy,"My mind is fucking BLOWN. I am fucking speechless‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt even hnnnnNNNNG

Remember when most fans were starting to get tired of Eren in S2 because his character felt very 2-dimensional and stuck in his ‚ÄúI AM GOING TO KILL ALL TITANS IN THIS WORLD AAARGH‚Äù mindset? Motherfucker played us."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JakeXXII,"So I see a lot of confusion around the Attack Titan power and Eren ""changing"" the past. 

The Attack Titan allows its users to glimpse memories of future inheritors of the Titan. This allows them to see the future through the future host's pov. The Attack Titan power alone didn't allow Eren to ""change"" the past. It is because Eren also possesses the Founding Titan that he was able to do so. 

When he kissed Historia's hand, he made contact with royal blood allowing him to use the founder's powers and likely took him to the Coordinate where he could have spent as much time as he wanted studying the future. It showed Eren his father's pov of his memory of killing the royal family. Although they didn't show it in S3, Eren would have also seen future him reminding his father why he was there and urging him to kill them. (Except the father because the father needed to stay alive in order for the Historia plot to happen and allow Eren to kiss her and thus set this whole thing into motion) 

Present day Eren was only ""there"" because Zeke was using the founder's powers to visit their father's memories. Without the founder, the attack titan power does not allow physically revisiting past memories. Eren knew he'd end up there if he just followed the path however thanks to his Titans powers. 

Now for the trippy Inception like part. From Grisha's point of view, he is alone with the Greiss family in that secret hideout. At that point, as shown in the episode, he has already seen some of future Eren's memories. Normally, he'd experience these visions through Eren's eyes just like every other Titan shifter when they glimpse their Titan's memories. This is where the Attack Titan's power comes into play. Whenever Eren is physically present in one of Grisha's memories, it creates a feedback loop where Grisha is then able to see future Eren's memory of that very moment in his own memories through Eren's eyes. He doesn't see Eren standing beside him in the hideout or in any other memory, he sees himself through future Eren's eyes. 

He is able to see Zeke though because Eren is looking at him in the future and thus he is able to see him through that memory

People are saying that Eren has been playing everyone since the beginning but I dont think that's accurate. Up until the moment he made contact with historia, he was ""normal"" Eren and had no notion of the things he'd later do/has already done (Unless he also went to the Coordinate when he touched Titan Dina in S2 but they didn't show it). I think it is more accurate to say that Future Eren (post Historia kiss) has been the one orchestrating everything since the start, possibly even his own birth.

Disclaimer : this is just my understanding of how this all works. I have not read the manga"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,idontgiveafunyun,Bro wtf this is one of the greatest twists I've ever seen in an anime episode. So many amazing twists in this anime so far.  I am so floored by this. Fuck I wish I had someone in real life to talk to about it

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rob3125,"I think the first king quite literally is the main villain. He and his vestige have been holding back Eldians and their power the entire time because of his guilt. To you, 2000 in the future is the first episode of the series, and from you, 2000 years ago will be next episode. Eren is waging a war from the future against a god who died millennia before Eren was ever born. The Titan who must alway push forward vs the the Titan who resolves to wait in atonement. The First King has physical representations of his will that eren is supposed to defeat (Zeke)."
Rob3125,Johnny20022002,"You‚Äôre probably on to something, here‚Äôs a quote from grisha last episode:

‚ÄúFrom long ago the inheritor of the attack Titan never obeyed others, and I know why. It‚Äôs all been to resist the self-righteousness of the king‚Äù 

He goes on to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôve all been led to this memory for this moment‚Äù

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vegasman20002,"On passing down memories:

In physics it is true that someone in a higher dimension of reality can see all of the lower dimensions, at once. For example if you look at a 2d piece of paper from our 3d world you see both the dimensions at the same time. 

In our world the fourth dimension is time. And they theorize there are something like 12 or 13 dimensions. So a being in the 5th dimension, in theory, would see all of time, all at once.

When grisha was talking to the royal woman, there was a shot where eren was on Grisha‚Äôs right side and zeke was on his left side.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shellycya,"I'm watching the episode a second time. Do you think Grisha sensed Eren and Zeke from the beginning? He didn't seem to act any different during the first baby scene but started acting stranger when he was at the deathbed of his patient.

Was he seeing the same two strange guys for many years and getting freaked out by them until he realized they were his sons?

Was the reason he stopped at the hideout based on what Zeke was saying about the walls falling in the future?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IceBre4th,"Eren is definitely able to share only selected memories. So it seems that he doesn't know the whole future, but is also only presented with snippets that his future self has set and that he sees through his father's memories, for example. He himself cannot send the memories to himself, so when he kissed Historia's hand, he saw his future self's memories in his father's memories. I think it would take too long to go through all the scenarios, since it is also a paradox. Because there should have been a point somewhere where someone started forging the future. Someone who makes the decision to let Historia and her father live to make sure Eren will kiss her hand to receive the memories. After all, there must have been an Eren who went through a completely different timeline than the one the current Eren is headed into. I have the feeling that Eren is also being manipulated by himself from the future.  A time paradox is such a brain-melter."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,venkrish,"1. For all the talk about freedom, isn't Eren also a slave to the future that he has already seen and is supposed to enact? No matter what he will do, the future will happen so why not make it happen and finally be free?

2. Does attack titan have the future memories power only because Eren is the first and final titan that also happened to hold the founding titan? Eren sent selected memories to the past attack titans creating illusion that attack titan had the power to see the future, when it was actually the power of the founding titan coming via the attack titan?

3. How does Grisha ""hear"" Eren's talking in the cavern when all Grisha can see are memories of Eren? Edit: Figured this one out, Eren talking to Grisha is a part of Eren's memory, which means when Grisha sees Eren's memory, he can hear Eren talking to him."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rocker27c23,"This episode suggests that the lives of Attack Titan holders are of a pre-deterministic nature. Even if this is only a special circumstance involving the Attack Titan, Founding Titan, and royal blood, the idea of a pre-determined life directly contradicts free will which Eren is so obsessed with. How is Eren ""free"" if he NEEDS to pressure Grisha into taking the Founding Titan? Was he not forced to make this choice? Did he have a choice at all?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Complex-Confusion,"What I don't understand is Grisha telling Zeke to stop Eren, but then he goes on gives Eren the attack titan, he could've stopped the chain right there if he wanted"
Complex-Confusion,insidiouskiller,"He couldnt.

Its a fixed timeline, no action he takes could change the future, any action he takes to stop this would end up causing it to happen anyway.

Also we know Grisha is easily motivated by vengeance and he tells Eren to take revenge for Carla before injecting him, and we know Eren didnt show him everything.

‚ÄúWhy wont you show me everything? The day it happens.... Carla‚Äôs safety...‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sami_sy44,"Isn‚Äôt it amazing how AOT manages to change how we see or feel about someone/something not only throughout the seasons BUT recently from one week to the other!! The layers are just insane!!

I want to get the next episodes but at the same time I never want the show to end üò©!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Donutzer,I guess I watched the wrong LOKI series -.-
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,barney-sandles,"Something to keep in mind is that mid-S3 Eren was still the same person we always thought he was, up until then he didn't have his knowledge of the future. So at that moment when he touched Historia and learned everything that would happen, we can still basically trust his motives and persona as we always did. And, at that moment, the future he saw seemed good enough for him to go through with.

So, I don't think it can all be totally evil. 

I also don't think it's fair to say that Eren brainwashed Grisha. We saw all throughout the memories, Grisha acting of his own accord without Eren's influence. It was only at that one critical moment where Eren intervened and encouraged Grisha to keep 'moving forward,' with a plan that Grisha had indeed come up with on his own and fully intended to do without Eren's influence. Things would have turned out differently without Eren's influence, but it's not like Eren is some time-lord architect who set up every event and controlled people against their will. Many things still happened that he had no control over. He just gave the final push across the finish line, at the point where Grisha's will-power was wavering."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mango789,Did the wall maria attack start before or after Greisha met with the king? I'm still confused on that
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FlowingMochi,"Don‚Äôt mean to be trippy here but doesn‚Äôt the revelation that the attack titan can see into the future/past and do all this jazz confirm Eren is a slave to himself? Or to the attack titan?

I get the attack titan doesn‚Äôt have a mind of its own so then would that mean Eren was the ‚Äúattack titan of all attack titans?‚Äù 

I‚Äôm confused as to how it was determined the attack titan fights for freedom if just all it takes for someone to get the titan is to eat the person who currently wields it. 

Was Eren the one who made it that way now that we know he can send future/past memories to holders of the attack titan? 

Stoked the anime is back!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SeaMeasurement9,why give eren the attack titan then? non-manga explanation would be nice
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CringeName,"Anime only here, I have some questions.

I'm a little confused about the memories Eren and Zeke are seeing. I understand that the attack titan can see certain memories that future inheritors send back, but the memories they are seeing of Grisha are in the past, and neither Eren or Zeke are present to witness (most of) them. So how are they seeing them? Is it part of the founding titans power?

If it isn't part of the founders power, then there are some implications..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DestinyUniverse1,"I just realized historia said eren wasn‚Äôt responsible for her families death but he literally was ü§£ I wonder what‚Äôs the significance of the attack Titan and why it gets to see into the future? Something must be special about the holder of the attack Titan to make that possible. Because even the founding Titan doesn‚Äôt have that power. That essentially makes the attack Titan the most powerful Titan overall since they get to see into the future. I wonder who eren sees in the future??? But at the same time maybe it ends with eren? Maybe everything has been built up to end with eren and that‚Äôs why even all the way during the owl time he got memories from eren yet we haven‚Äôt gotten any hints of eren getting memories from his child or future inherenter. And if you think about it the first episode was called to you 2000 years from now and the next one is from you 2000 years ago. So I definitely think it ends with eren or there‚Äôs just some significance to erens possession of the attack Titan. Also though how the hell will eren regenerate his head is he just dead‚Ä¶? Zeke was still barely alive when he blew himself up so when the Titan swallowed him he was able to regenerate even more and heal. But like eren literally got his head BLOWN CLEAN OFF. And there‚Äôs no titans around ü§£ will he just regenerate infront of everyone? Well he turn into a Titan to save his body? Will he live on as zeke? There‚Äôs so many questions and 8 episodes left. I still want to know what historia is doing, I feel like after zeke and eren wake up though zeke will immediately switch sides and I feel like everyone at that point will have to form a temporary alliance just to stop eren LMFAO based off the pacing of episodes AND the opening that spoiled the rumbling I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs set to happen episode 6. I think episode 5 will basically be explaining everything and what the 2000 years ago means or whatever. I always thought the significance of the paths was kinda low because Ymir also gained access to it. But eren is on another level."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,joz3rh,aot getting a world record for the most uno reverse cards in two episodes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ItSpaiz,Can someone explain to me what does it mean when all the attack titans before eren served their purpose to achieve this future? Please explain without spoilers
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shanksta31,"after watching this episode I just came up with a thought. in the ending song sequence, what if  Eren is going through the memories of his future inheritor, and that inheritor is walking through what is left of paradise island. it looks like paradise island had been wiped out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MapleJacks2,Looks like the metaphorical devil on the shoulder became a lot more literal.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Legitimate-Row7081,im actually starting to think zeke might be the hero of the show and eren is the villain
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xXTylonXx,This episode and the implications being discussed in this thread have solidified Eren as officially more sadistic and evil than Light Yagami ever could be. He is like a mouse compared to this evil time lord shit that we are witnessing.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shroffinator,Even in Episode 1; eren repeated the same inspiring Scout line that the Commandeer told his dad when he first arrived on the island as a way to inspire him to seek out the Founders
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sparrowjack00,So attack on titan is literally just a fight against authority
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,usernames_ar3_hard,"A bunch of comments in this thread are discussing how Eren has essentially controlled past Attack Titans by sending select memories to them, but I'm not sure that this is implied in the show? 

We know that Eren cannot access the Coordinate except by touching Royals, and we've seen him do that three times: Dina's titan, Historia and Zeke. 

Further, Eren was able to communicate with Grisha only because Zeke was showing him Grisha's memories, which Zeke could do because he's a royal. Other than this one instance, I don't think we have seen Eren demonstrate the ability to ""send"" memories to past Attack Titans or even access their memories. He only knows Grisha's memories because of what Grisha wrote in his diary. 

The implication is that Eren hasn't really been pulling the strings all along. It's only after he kissed Historia's hand that he would have seen Grisha's memories and would have come to realize what was in store for the future. He couldn't have ""sent"" memories of the Wall being breached to Grisha, because Grisha was not in contact with a Royal until he confronted the Founding Titan, by which point, the Wall had already been breached"
usernames_ar3_hard,Johnny20022002,Future eren could‚Äôve been pulling the strings. Not past and present eren.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bakuding,"Eren‚Äôs referencing his own memories to influence the past is very Lisa Barlow‚Äôs ‚ÄúLisa Barlow is an amazing human‚Äù energy 


I will be so happy if anyone gets this reference"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hashmaroon,"btw can someone explain to me if zeke really had the founder to, could they like both control it or was zeke just lying?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,magichobo3,If Zeke hadn't tried to show eren that grisha manipulated him would he have been able to force grisha to steal the founding titan? If so does that mean that he knew Zeke would go through the attack titans memories to allow him to do so?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Elements-fury,How did grisha see eren when he went to go kill the children? If grisha decided to not kill the children (which he chose not to) then eren wouldn‚Äôt be able to talk to grisha from the future because he never adopts the attack titan as a result of grisha chickening out‚Ä¶
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadZeus007,"I don't understand, Grisha seems rather sane when taking Eren to the woods.

Also, if Eren saw all this when he kissed the hand, why was he still pretty normal in S4 part 1 flashbacks, he only becomes ""chad eren"" when he's in marley."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"After this episode I have two ideas. Eren is going to go crazy like Danny did in GOT, and gabi eats Reiner then Eren. I think there‚Äôs too many parallels between eren and gabi for her not be more significant to erens final story. 

Also now that I think about it. Is that scene from the intro where eren is screaming him activating the rumbling. If it is then that must mean he ate zeke because how else could he get that ability unless Ymir gave it to him I suppose."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SayLessSam,So who's in control zeke or eren?
SayLessSam,shittybillz,I feel like zeke never was. Him saying he can enact his plan at any moment is a bluff
SayLessSam,K_2Smooth,Eren
K_2Smooth,matthieuC,Mephisto
SayLessSam,nokyinaabarai,Eren it seems
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SayLessSam,Why is it that Eren is the Attack Titan that gets to command previous Attack Titans? Is there no future Attack Titan wielder after him?
SayLessSam,cybersidpunk,"he can't command anyone, he can just send memories to the past titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kkungergo,Wtf are daddy issues? Just traumatise your father back.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fearlix2,"Ok so I'm seeing a lot of confusion over this episode which is understandable for anime onlies. Manga readers had a month to make theories and analyze the story between each chapter which is roughly equal to every half episode.
So I'm going to try my best to explain stuff.
First off, something u should keep in mind is that not everything that comes out of the character's mouths is the truth. Case in point is grisha's explanation of the attack titan's power. He explained that the attack titan's ability allows it's inheritors to see the memories of future inheritors which is technically true but not the whole thing.
Let me explain. All the nine titans including the attack titan have the ability to see the memories of past inheritors ( porco seeing ymir's memories, Armin seeing bertholdt's etc) but only the attack titan has the ability to not only see memories from past inheritors but also send their own memories to past inheritors. So essentially what grisha said was true, he can see erens memories but he cant choose which ones to see because the memories he is seeing are being handpicked and sent back by eren and so by only sending specific memories back to his father he essentially manipulates and forces him to act as he wishes.
Something else to keep in Mind is that eren was actually unaware of the mechanics of this ability until right before the intro plays in the episode.
The first time we see the attack titan's power in action is when grisha notices future Zeke for the first time in the basement. If u pay attention in the episode grisha mentions Zeke's name before even seeing him just as he wakes up and he only does so when eren focuses on a picture of Zeke. So eren unconsciously sent back a memory of Zeke to his father when he noticed the picture and upon realizing how the power worked began essentially drip feeding grisha memories to guide him in the direction of the main timeline.
 It's a closed loop. Eren sends back memories, therefore grisha takes the founding and passes it to eren so 8 years later eren can use a combo of founding and attack powers to drip feed memories to his father and it all starts all over again.
And as for how eren knows the future despite not getting any info from inheritors after him, well it's ... Weird. Basically the idea is that if u see someone else's memory of something then that person's memory will become a part of your memories. When future eren sent his own memories to grisha they became part of grisha's memories which allowed grisha to become a sort of link between past and future eren. four years ago eren kissed historias hand and was able to see his father's memories and in his father's memories he found his own memories of the future. And that's how he knows his own future.
I think that about covers almost everything. Do ask if u need clarification on anything else."
fearlix2,oyuhhhhh,"This actually clears up the scene in this episode where Eren notices that Grisha could ‚Äúsee‚Äù Zeke. Makes a lot of sense, thank you for that"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_kater,"Eren is the mc that we needed. He isn‚Äôt a hero and he no longer advocates for any of that idealistic bullshit. He wants to protect those he cares for and if anyone should pose a threat they will be eliminated. Im tired of all the sheltered ‚Äúim gonna save the world and protect everyone‚Äù bullshit. We needed a selfish prick mc like eren. Definitely my favourite mc of all anime and top 3 aot characters. Only old eren though, young eren was a bit of a pissbaby."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rocker27c23,"What horrible things is Eren going to do that Grisha was so horrified about? Freedom for Eldians comes at a high price, and it's clear that Eren is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that freedom. He's already walking the line between protagonist and antagonist. Hopefully, he remains a hero and doesn't turn psycho."
rocker27c23,Ferronier,"More correctly, between good guy and bad guy. You can be the literal devil and still be the protagonist if the story follows you. Protagonists are not inherently good and antagonists are not inherently bad. Antagonists simply oppose and create obstacles for the protagonist."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seele-117,It was glorious!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pleiop,Jesus. Who the fuck are you Eren?!? This completely changes everything since ep 1 season 1. Nothing is the same. Fuck
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoosySucker69,So did Eren manipulate his younger self by showing only part of the memory like he did with Grisha or younger Eren saw everything?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lunchbag-mermaid,I think that Eren was in that scene from Season 1 where (I think) everyone was fighting for bread after they were evacuated and there was a man standing just behind them against a pillar.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aceeed,"I don't know what to think about Eren, like he's a Psycho manipulating the future."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chungulungus,"Eren: Look at me, I‚Äôm the captain now"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YaboiGh0styy,Voice actors are God tier i‚Äôm convinced the show wouldn‚Äôt be half as good without them. Even the Voice actors for the characters who barely show up our fantastic everyone gave it there all and it really shows.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainSmeg,I wasn‚Äôt emotionally ready for this and Demon Slayer today.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Galaxy-Warrior,Imma sell my kidney for access to the next episode I need it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rayk10k,So this means that Eren manipulated Grisha into giving eren the attack Titan and founding Titan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mercuryheart_,I've been waiting for this chapter to be animated since it first game out. It didn't disappoint.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fellow-Traveller01,So did Eren know his head was gonna get blown off?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,supienewoolz,"This episode was mind boggling, and making me rethink everything we know about/seen of grisha. Like I remember when we first got memories of grisha giving eren the attack and founding titans, it seemed like he was desperate because he needed eren to continue the mission‚Ä¶ but now we know that grisha is desperate for eren to be stopped, so I wonder why he gave him the Titans?? Was he not aware of eren‚Äôs crazy plan when he gave him the titans, but became aware before that after he was manipulated to kill the reiss family? Eren why u gotta make this so complicated for me LMAO"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaktusJacklynn,"I'm on the verge of tears with the closing credits this time around. I don't quite know why. I guess because the journey is almost done and it will be missed. 

ETA: it's like the last day of high school and you're a senior about to graduate."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,afcc1313,"Am I the only one that never sees Eren as the villain? I just love the character anyway lol

Only time I was a bit sad was when he hurt Mikasa."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,The ending of season 3 where Tge Owl has memories of Mikasa and Armin make so much more sense now. It's not just that all Titans memories are connected through the paths (like I assumed up till now) it's specifically a foresight ability of the Attack Titan. It makes so much sense. Though that does lead me to wonder... The only other character in the show that has had glimpses of the future is Falco. Do we think perhaps Falco could inherit the Attack Titan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dilsosos,Why did Grisha turn Eren into a pure titan and let himself get eaten if he told Zeke to stop Eren?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrypticHunter37,"So no attack titan really has true free will, they at any point can be manipulated by the future holder, so if Eren truly wants to be free he will need to find a way to get rid of his shifter and given he isn't seemingly being manipulated by any future attack titan I'm guessing he must get rid of the shifters, or at least the attack titan, in some way, maybe the ability to turn into titans as a whole, I've heard that one being thrown around as an alternative to the euthenasia plan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"So now that it‚Äôs established that Eren can send memories into precious attack Titan users, is that where Falco got the memories of odm gear users back in Episode 1? Does that mean Falco will eventually inherent the attack Titan? Or will Eren find a way to use the founder to send memories to all Titan shifters in the past?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PunjabiBruah,Imagine your own son‚Ä¶ SONNING YOU. I am mindblown
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShaidarHaran2,"I've literally never gotten why people react to things by writing out ""I'M SCREAMING!"", like, you're sitting alone screaming at a screen?

...When I saw the end plus the next episode title, I fucking screamed at my screen! I KNEW the overall story of AoT was always going to loop back to the very beginning, with the title ""To You, in 2000 Years"", and Eren's dream that seemed to last forever. It's all really coming...Well, um, I used this last week, but to a head!

Man, there is not going to be another show like this."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tagor99,So Eren is the Lisan Al-Gaib?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IceBre4th,It's like Isayama saw the memories of his future self and knew exactly what to write from the beginning
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xmandarinorangex,"The whole predetermined attack Titan seeing the future thing threw me for a loop at first. But after thinking about it and thinking about how every person that had the attack Titan before wren knew wren was coming and knew what he is/ was gonna do. Meaning Ymir even knew who he was and what was the end of what she started. Idk it‚Äôs wild everyone was fulfilling a prophecy basically, like Kruger gave it to Grisha to give to wren knowing what would happen. I could use some clarification on what the future seeing powers are and how they work tho.

Side note: now I‚Äôm thinking the reason why wren was laughing when Sasha died was because that was the moment he was like ‚ÄúFUCK everything I see is going to happen, everything‚Äù"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Proud_Bluejay_5568,Can someone explain this concept to me? I‚Äôm confused because I still don‚Äôt understand how eren spoke with his father which resulted in him killing the royal family because at that time eren was still a kid. So how can a future eren start a chain to help a young eren do all the stuff he has done until now. Time travel man‚Ä¶
Proud_Bluejay_5568,VEGANMONEYBALL,"Okay so Grisha can see the future thru Eren‚Äôs eyes, so he‚Äôs literally watching himself thru Eren‚Äôs eyes which is also how he see‚Äôs Zeke. He also can see further into the future to what‚Äôs going to happen and he knows Eren‚Äôs intentions which explains why he was telling Zeke to stop Eren. That‚Äôs at least what I got from it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Visualize_,"Since season 4 part 2 started I've been so confused what the hell is even happening. I still really enjoy watching, but I feel so lost in the plot"
Visualize_,Odd-Block-2998,You can rewatch everything from season 1 to get the idea. I think it may kill the fun if someone tells you the details.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,malont61,Why was Grisha able to see zeke and eren?
malont61,ColmanTallman,"Grisha wasn‚Äôt seeing them, he was experiencing Eren‚Äôs memories of these moments. He‚Äôs simultaneously living his life and experiencing the memories of Eren in the future observing the moment. 

Notice how Grisha never looks at Eren or comments on his appearance. That‚Äôs because he can‚Äôt SEE Eren, he‚Äôs only seeing the memory from Eren‚Äôs perspective looking at himself. That‚Äôs why he stares past him with the key. On the contrary, he only sees Zeke when Zeke is within Eren‚Äôs field of view. In both of the scenes where Grisha talks to Zeke, Eren is BEHIND Grisha, meaning he can see Zeke in Eren‚Äôs memory of the current situation he‚Äôs in. 

Grisha is just seeing Eren‚Äôs memory of the event that‚Äôs happening in real time, allowing him to basically talk to Eren in the future."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kykusan,Oh my fucking GOD! There are so many twist upon twists and my expression this whole time watching was exactly like Zeke's. Goddammit Eren!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Soccerfreakgod,I understand Eren playing the uno reverse card and all but isn't Zeke still in control as Ymir will only listen to his wishes and he can carry out the Euthanasia plan with/without Eren's consent? What am i missing?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Odd-Block-2998,"Story tellers on 1/30/2021: It is still very hard to come out with a story involving time loop. Difficult to cover all the plot holes.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Blessed_Passenger14,"Not sure if this has been explained yet, but if grisha was capable of defeating the founder, then why the fuck didn‚Äôt he just transform and defend his family during the fall of shiganshina.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vinvear,"Can I get this cleared up without spoilers; These revelations are insane, but Eren is dead now right? Do we just not know what will happen yet, or is it known that he could come back somehow? I'm confused."
vinvear,cybersidpunk,a decapitated head is alive for like 10-15 secs. it probably only took 2-3 secs max for the head to come in contact with zeke and the time in paths is infinite so eren is kinda alive. once they are back in IRL world he should be dead.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mike_kitty11,"So I have a question (theory?). Eren and Zeke went to the Paths place when they touched where time is infinite and instant, wouldn‚Äôt Eren have gone there with Historia when he kissed her hand and Historia would‚Äôve seen everything Eren did like with Zeke? We haven‚Äôt seen much of Historia this season, couldn‚Äôt Eren and Historia be plotting together then?"
mike_kitty11,cybersidpunk,"historia didnt see anything because she is just a person with royal blood not a titan. also i assume only royal blood titans with founding titan can go into paths and ask ymir to do stuff.
also hostoria didnt look like she knew anything but eren had that crazy face."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Proud_Bluejay_5568,"wait so is eren the cause of his father killing the royals,, or was his father going to do it regardless because its a fixed timeline?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,C137-Morty,"I wonder if the current attack titan knows the identity of the future attack titan or if that future person can hide their identity. 

One might even be able to argue that Eren chose his mother by leading Grisha to her."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tikipon,"So Eren/future attack titan wanted everything that has happened to happen or atleast is powerless to change anything.  They are just acting out the series of events that led them there, going  back to the first (attack) titan .

The first A titan sees memories of the future and know it will happen.

If that is correct then there is no agenda or influence behind it. The A titan is not fighting anything, because if it did it could just send memories back and change things around. But as future seems what is it the attack titan is fighting for, everything will happen regardless of choices."
tikipon,IzziTheEpic,"Exactly, there is no free will."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bshafs,"Dumb question but... Why did Grisha have to kill everyone in the royal family? Was it just part of Eren's plan to get Historia on the throne, or is there another reason?"
bshafs,romanNood1es,"Yes, and I believe Eren also told Grisha to spare the Reiss father so the events in season 3 can play out."
romanNood1es,bshafs,"When did that happen? Is it just implied by Grisha saying ""i killed everyone but their father""?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,awkwardpotatita,Wait what
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,margaritaorange,"This series requires a long essay if not a thesis hahaha.

I think another clue from this episode is where Zeke realizes that Eren‚Äôs not brainwashed by Grisha, and Eren says something like he‚Äôs born this way, which is conveniently set against the scene where he and Mikasa killed those thugs. Which kinda tells his destiny. Also, if Eren‚Äôs role is pre-determined and he knows about it, I suppose that scene in front of the mirror where he tells himself to fight is a way to rally himself to stay on his path. Because Eren‚Äôs gotta do what Eren‚Äôs gotta do."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KryptoniansDontBleed,So Grisha killed the royal family to stop the titans from outside to attack the wall? But then he didn't do anything about it?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mighty__orbot,"So is this really a power of the Attack Titan, or was Eren just taking advantage of the time-spanning aspect of the Coordinate?"
mighty__orbot,hatefulsalad,I think it's the power of the attack titan. Zeke took them to Grishas memories and Eren used the attack titans ability to send memories to his father.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,conqueror45,"I still don't understand what is the purpose of eren , what he will do with ymir's power?"
conqueror45,DaughterOfIsis,The rumbling lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_Sadsloth_,The twists this show has are amazing!! Like I never could have imagined this!!! Can't wait for next episode!!!!!!!!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ISWIS-AND,I had to go to a youtube channel to fully understand....I think i got more lost when it came back with new characters and was wondering ...where is Eren? Mikasa? Armin etc...that is where I got lost...thanks for this thread and many others and youtube channels...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tonguebuster,How many more episodes left?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sigmastorm77,"Eren: So you must be ""Fry-daa""


Frieda: Actually it is Princess Freeda Reiss


Eren: Really? Then why is there an ""i"" in it?


Freeda: There isn't!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"Season 2 episode 12 (Timestamp: 13:30)

Eren can be seen accessing the power of the founding Titan for a second time, except he is no longer in contact with Dina Fritz. So unless mikasa is somehow of royal blood, because he was carrying her, then eren must be able to use the founding Titans ability under some circumstances without contact with a royal. It may just be a time duration thing. Like he might just have a limited window after touching a royal. 

Really strange, but interesting.

Edit: I suppose it would be a cool twist to find out Mikasa was a royal somehow. She does get a weird flashback to people with blonde hair in season 1 episode 6 (Timestamp 10:02). Maybe those were her royal cousins or something. Doesn‚Äôt make sense though because he‚Äôs touched mikasa too many times."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IonlycareaboutYelena,Fuxk them kids Ereh at it again
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,illumantimess,My big takeaway: The world would have been far better off if there was quality therapy to help Eren process the horrors of watching his mother and others eaten alive. The attack titan seems to be a metaphor for the destructive power of unprocessed rage
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JustCallMeTsukasa-96,"Seriously y‚Äôall! The intensity in these last few episodes is just so much, it‚Äôs actually starting to make me tear up for a bit with all this waiting and anticipating.üòÖ"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jimmienoman,"My HUGE plot point was Zeke said he waited what felt like an eternity for Eren to be rebuilt. 

He then proceeded to want to walk Eren down memory lane.

In order for Zeke to know what memories to show Eren, would he have not had to walk through all of the history thus seeing how it played out prior to ‚Äúshowing Eren‚Äù?

So guess this could explained either by arrogance of Zeke (possible). 

or that the past was not changed yet as Eren had to be present to affect the past. This though would create issues with how AoT plays out timeline fixedness as Zeke would be viewing the past NOT viewing the past prior to Eren interfering. The key being in order for Zeke to see an ‚Äúuntainted‚Äù historical event then a butterfly effect view of time would have to be present which contradicts how AoT is presenting ‚Äútime travel‚Äù theory. Am I wrong in this?"
Jimmienoman,Johnny20022002,I‚Äôm pretty sure if you go back you‚Äôll see there‚Äôs a clear point where it‚Äôs eren leading zeke through the past. So he‚Äôs showing things zeke may not have scene previously. We see this when zeke is shocked by how early grisha found the royal hide out. Also hes shocked when he sees eren influencing grisha. Meaning he had not previously seen that memory. Also the past doesn‚Äôt change.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Buttcheekllama,"This episode did a great job of rekindling the rage I feel along with Eren. 

The show does so much in the back half to humanize the world outside the walls that at times you forget just how monstrously atrocious the treatment of the Eldians is. 

It‚Äôs not the good thing to do, but I‚Äôm with Eren. Fuck‚Äôem all, burn the planet to the ground."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,Need Levi to come back and beat some manners into this brat Eren.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kagamaii,So Eren already knew everything that was going to happen in the future. So that's why he told his father to kill the royals?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vojaaaaa,"Can someone explain in detail, how did Eren manipulate Grisha? I don't get it."
Vojaaaaa,Kltpzyxm-rm,"Basically, the attack titan‚Äôs power to see the future works by allowing them to see the memories of its future inheritors in addition to its past ones (like we see with other titan shifters). From there, Eren was able to manipulate Grisha by showing him specific memories of the future. For example, getting him to confront the royal family by showing him the memory of the wall being destroyed. Likewise, Eren was able to talk to Grisha directly to get him to kill Frieda by sharing his own memory of that conversation (basically, Eren talks to Grisha, and then has a memory of what he said. He then sends that memory back to Grisha at that time, which from Grisha‚Äôs perspective is like Eren talking to him directly). That‚Äôs my interpretation anyway."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vamsimedisetti,"I see two possibilities here:

1) Grisha may have meant Eren Kruger when he yelled ""Will this save Eldia?"" and since he can see the future, he saw what's Eren going to do and warned Zeke. If this is the case Eren Yeager wouldn't be manipulating timelines  
2) If Grisha called his own son then Eren must be manipulating timelines"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ansanm,"Anyone else disappointed with the art, especially the faces and figures."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KryptoniansDontBleed,I am not sure I understood anything that happened.. So the Attack Titan can see the future. What has that to do with anything else that happened in this episode?
KryptoniansDontBleed,QuietFanUser,Eren gave memories of him and zeke seeing his fathers memories to grisha. Though he didn‚Äôt give memories of anything related to the wall being destroyed or Carla. He also gave memories to grisha that we haven‚Äôt seen yet? So grisha is scared of Eren because of that.
KryptoniansDontBleed,Agentloldavis,"Bruh, if you really have to ask that, just rewatch the episode, because you literally didn't pay attention."
Agentloldavis,K_2Smooth,They need to rewatch the entire show sounds more like it lol
Agentloldavis,KryptoniansDontBleed,Nah I paid attention but it didn‚Äôt make any sense to me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lunchbag-mermaid,My boyfriend never finished season 1 but when S4pt 2 came out he watched it and I‚Äôve told him what happens every episode as best as I can. But I definitely won‚Äôt be able to explain this episode
lunchbag-mermaid,Fr33zurBurn,That is the wrong way to watch a show lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Madvillains,"If Eren could see the future, how come he didn't know he was going to get quick scoped by Gabi? I'm confused."
Madvillains,Mudjumper,"He isn‚Äôt all knowing, as grisha demonstrated. ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you show me more?‚Äù He can only see the specific memories that are sent back from the future.

If we go back to Liberio, it seems like eren knew that he would get the warhammer, yet he still had to figure out on his own that he needed to use the jaw to break through Lara‚Äôs hardening"
Mudjumper,illumantimess,Your point on the warhammer made me rethink the line ‚Äúnow or never Mikasa‚Äù when the war hammer was about to finish him off. Wonder if Eren knew Mikasa would join the battle? On my earlier rewatch I was confused why Eren would know Mikasa was on her way.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,No no. I still think Eren is going to save the world. No way he‚Äôs the villain now.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DukeofDoinks,"Lol after reading some of the comments, did Eren intentionally get his head blown off by Gabi?"
DukeofDoinks,Odd-Block-2998,"I think he didn't know that his head will get blown off by Gabi (except if Gabi or someone nearby is the future Attack Titan and they saw his head blown off), but he knew that he would succeed regardless what happened and what he did.

He can only see the memory of the past and future Attack Titans and the War Hammer Titan. I am not sure whether he could see the memory of the Founding Titan or not. All of these memories should not have Gabi shooting his head off.

Note: I don't read manga, so I don't know whether Gabi or someone nearby will be the future Attack Titan or not."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sDollarWorthless2022,Can anyone who hasn‚Äôt read the manga answer me this: how tf is eren gonna do shit with his head separated from his fucking body??
sDollarWorthless2022,Mudjumper,"I‚Äôm assuming that he‚Äôll have full control of the founding titan‚Äôs power, and it will let him regen or shift instantly once he and zeke are done in the paths"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hartimez,Maldita serie tan buena
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheZeBode,"I just don't understand the future thing, do the previous attack titans have no free will at all?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OzzietheTurtle,Guys. Listen. What I don't get is if Eren wants Rumbling then why not simply use Historia?
OzzietheTurtle,rl68rl,"It needs to be a Titan with royal blood, not just any human that has it.

And Eren doesn‚Äôt want Historia to be titanized because of the 13 year lifespan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Type1996,This is crazy because I always wondered what was the attack titan/Founder titan‚Äôs power. No way he‚Äôs just a regular ass titan and they finally revealed it this episode. Explains Erens attitude all the way from the beginning of the show so much. Also I think Eren fucked Historia‚Ä¶.all according to plan. Which is INSANE
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sandra-Alek,"This episode is 5/11, marvelous"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LoudTension3,"I‚Äôm going to need to watch this episode like 10 times to understand it, why would Grisha kill the royal family because Eren encouraged him to? He‚Äôs clearly horrified by the future (whatever the hell Eren ends up doing)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AudaciousXII,So what he told about Mikasa and she is slave was him using the founders and telling himself to say that to her? Only way he knows about the Ackermans powers right?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CoolAbdull27,What is most revealing is the man had the oppurtunity to change his past but was like naw I think I liked how it all went down and I' m cool with who I've become (rewind all the horror trauma)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dracob2099,"Kinda confusing, did Eren altered the past?"
dracob2099,VEGANMONEYBALL,"Grisha can see the future thru Eren‚Äôs eyes due to the ability of the Attack Titan so he‚Äôs watching himself thru Eren‚Äôs eyes. That‚Äôs how he can see Zeke, it‚Äôs thru Eren‚Äôs eyes. You notice when he hugs Zeke, Eren is standing behind Grisha watching them. Eren had been manipulating his father thru the Attack Titan‚Äôs ability to see thru the eyes of its future host."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shroffinator,"Okay the real implication no one is mentioning; eren essentially killed his dad‚Äôs sister to set everything in motion. 

He kept his dad to watch the zeppelin‚Äôs after beating the shit out of him knowing he was keeping him from stopping his sister being murdered & eaten so it‚Äôs put in motion ‚Äúthe story he began‚Äù. To radicalize him, to ruin Zeke"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deadassreal,EREN IS A MENACE
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ModieOfTheEast,"I guess there it is. I was expecting some kind of time travel twist. It wasn't so hard to figure out, but I hoped it would be done in a different way. Now we have a character that's basically the mastermind behind the whole story, the character who has been influencing the events of the story. And I personally don't understand why authors like to include a character like that (typically it's in Shounen where they have to make the final antagonist seem to be powerful, but here, I don't know why you would even go for it). It takes away from characters actions as they never had a choice to begin with (similar like with the Ackermann DNA twist). Yes, I get it's part of the ""freedom"" theme the anime goes for, but I don't think it was necessary. I mean, all that's left now is to show that Eren has been influencing Events even before that to really hammer home that there is this one character who has been behind everything. And I mean, they already did that to an extent with Kruger. I don't know. The music was good and the studio did a good job, but I am really not sure if the story can actually recover from such a blow."
ModieOfTheEast,AbaramaGolding,So you‚Äôre telling me you predicted that Eren manipulated his dad to kill the royal family many years after it happened?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mv3tt,Was the first attack titan an Ackerman? They share the same rebellious relationship towards the King
Mv3tt,DaughterOfIsis,Ackerman's aren't subjects of Ymir. They can't be Titans.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Trollzore,Hey so why did Grisha give Eren the attack titan?
Trollzore,cybersidpunk,because eren told him carla would live if he did this and this is the only way to save eldia. in the moment he was going crazy thus telling zeke to stop him. afterwards when he knew that calra actually died he would have been like fuck it and if he didnt give eren the titan it would have been all for nothing.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maddogkaz,"I'm not sure I like any of this time travel stuff since I already see a plot hole with Grisha wanting to stop Eren but still giving him the titan power.

Not to mention we are told the attack titan can see the future and no one else, this is a special ability that only the attack titan has. So my question is why did Falco see the future in the first episode of season 4?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KryptoniansDontBleed,"Okay, so how was Grisha so damn easily persuaded by Eren? After the deed Grisha cries, yells and even begs Zeke for help and tells him to stop Eren. But just a few words by Eren make him murder an entire family?"
KryptoniansDontBleed,cybersidpunk,"eren didnt just speak but also showed him some future memories. grisha said ""why wont you show me everything?"" when he comes outside, which mean eren showed him specific memories in the future which made him do it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wolf8808,"Unpopular opinion,  but this whole time travel thing didn't work for me. Always feels cheap"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Narae-Chan,This anime is incredibly idiotic. I‚Äôll watch to the end but the reasoning is everything is so absurd lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MightyAxel,This show is so stupid üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ it better have a good ending
MightyAxel,IzziTheEpic,Why are you even watching?
IzziTheEpic,MightyAxel,Many claim that this show is a masterpiece so I decided to watch it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheNewGuyGames,"So, does this mean, or is it possible that this means, that Eren told Grisha to ""give"" him the titans powers? Obviously, Grisha had a lot to be horrified over regardless, but Grisha's emotions in those flashbacks in S1 where he is injecting Eren felt very similar to the ones in this episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Original_Jelly_3895,If eren is just sending memories to his dad how did he speak to him?
Original_Jelly_3895,cybersidpunk,by sending memories of him speaking
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LawsonThomas,Wait so how is eren in control of the memories
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Toodope4kidz,Omg the secret trait of the attack is by far the craziest part about this show. Still love Eren. Top tier Anproganist!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSlumpDog,So Eren was orchestrating his father to do all those things?
TheSlumpDog,AbaramaGolding,Yes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Affectionate_Eagle75,Eren's design is INSANE. As the series progresses we just see him lose more and more of his humanity
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,L_sigh_kangeroo,Bruh Grisha hugging Zeke and apologizing broke my heart
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Planeswalker2814,One of the things I'm confused about is exactly at what point in the story did Eren start manipulating his father?
Planeswalker2814,Vinthar,I would guess when the owl mentioned mikasa and armin
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gregfess,Can Eren see his own future memories or is it only the next users memories?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lunchbag-mermaid,I often get lost in different people‚Äôs objectives and just the overall story if someone could help me. Zeke is saying that Eren was manipulated by his father. But‚Ä¶ did Eren manipulate his father from the future‚Ä¶? So it‚Äôs all just a big loop?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MindYoBeezWax,Eren is the perfect example of an Anti-villain
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,slatkiller,What chapter did this episode end on?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,realdusty_shelf,I‚Äôm so confused
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Veeeeeezy,"The only thing that doesn't add up to me is the fact that Grisha chooses to give the Attack and Founding Titan to Eren. Even though it's a certainty based on the future, it still seems like that's something that he has a choice in doing. What is his reasoning for giving it? If he's so against the idea of what Eren's plotting, why would he give the power to Eren?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mathapp,"Just watched the episode. What just happened?
How is grisha hugging zeke in his memories and how is eren convincing grisha in grisha's memories? Also what could eren have done which makes grisha demand zeke to stop him? I NEED ANSWERS OMG"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Freakency,Am I the only one who wonders why is eren‚Äôs face so awfully drawn suddenly?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dualitysl,"This may just be a very confusing thing for me, but in Ep 1, Grisha was already murdering the Reiss family and acquiring the founding titan. When did Eren influence Grisha to do that, because Eren didn't have the Attack Titan yet. So how did he do it? Or is it some Paths mumbo jumbo that I don't understand?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"Eren to Grisha: look at me, look at me‚Ä¶I am the captain now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,foolie02,"MAPPA animated this episode with perfection man, I‚Äôm just blown away. The extra detail on the facial expressions were everything. It was so intense. Grisha walking to the Royal hideout was beautifully executed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justaverage00,wtf Eren is actually a demon üò≠üò≠
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Strawberrycherrypiee,"I‚Äôm so confused, if Grisha knew the terrible things Eren is going to do why did he then give his Titan abilities to him ??"
Strawberrycherrypiee,klaygotsnubbed,eren told him that the only way to save eldia was to go with the plan and give him the titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,moodytoon,"So if Eren already knows everything that has happened and will happen, is he truly ""free""?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Koemans2020,"I am blown away by the revelations in this episode. Just..wow..

It makes me wonder why Eren Kruger only told Grisha to protect Armin and Mikasa before Grisha was injected by the Titan serum.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fred42069,Zeke pulled the Uno reverse card of getting the founding titan's powers only for Eren to pull the Uno reverse card on him after he let him see his father's memories and manipulate him... Jesus Christ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reborno, So what did Eren see when he kissed Historia‚Äôs hand?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Palebluedot1002,It‚Äòs simple. Zeke thought him and eren were playing uno the whole time. But in reality they were playing 4d time travel chess
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CasualJonMMA,Best Reverse Uno ever
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Safe-Hugs43,Yeah that episode left me speechless lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,depression420b,"Fkin 10/10 episode for 10/10 series. Even though I've already read the manga i was still on the edge of my seat. The music, the animation, The timing, the acting, all were perfect. The scene from ep 1 when grisha flashes the key but was looking at old eren was amazing. Also loved that they're playing cost of freedom/0sk ost again and again. Masterpiece!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,no0necaretofu,Eren show his memories of the day that got attack the wall and urging to save his family to greshia . And some  memories of future but it got limited by Eren . So he don't know about the rumbling .

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UltramusMaximus,Holy shit
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lakeland234,THE TRIPLE CROSS KILLED ME
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RedEye55,"I still dont understand whats Eren's plan? he wanted at first to make a small rumble so outside world would stay away for 50 years and they will get stronger weapon-wise.

then Zeke ""convinced"" him (was obviously fake by eren) that the only way is full rumble that people inside the walls wont be able to give birth and they will 'die' by time.

&#x200B;

What now? grisha said stop eren so it means that eren's plan is now different than the original one? im confused what eren is about to do (please no spoilers but do explain if you can, thanks)"
RedEye55,DaughterOfIsis,Eren is about to do the rumbling and kill pretty much everything on the planet.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,guyluis,This episode was just a beautiful symphony. Just years of work coming and piecing together. What a masterpiece.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Madvillains,Eren with the double double-cross.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Winners_84,That episode was awesome. I don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore after going into it thinking Zeke was holding all the aces to find out he was holding nothing. Brilliant. Can‚Äôt wait for next week.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Safe-Hugs43,Looking at his childhood how did he turn out like this? Like understand living in the walls and that driving you crazy but he like an extremist from no where (kinda) idk I need to rewatch from a new perspective probably and maybe some reaction/analysis
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dankmemer8585,eren wrote the story with the author
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ottawanonymoose,Eren made his past father go all Macbeth on the royal family against his nature. He is his own antagonist. My brain hurts.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Such-Consequence-738,Mind blown
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,goremouth,"Grisha looks so, so miserable. I loved reading these panels way back when but seeing them animated is just *chef‚Äôs kiss*"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,666JFC666,"This is my guess on Erin's end goal:

He wants to kill everyone. Like, EVERYONE. Just wants the human race to die out and be ended"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThePrince_OfWhales,"I'm both amazed and appalled at this episode. Brilliant storytelling, the showing of animation of earlier seasons, obviously the huge twist... incredible.

But as a dad to an almost 3 year-old little boy I admit this episode broke my heart in about a thousand different ways. I feel like I need to lay down."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xRelucity,"I‚Äôm still so confused lmao, just 2 questions, is he a bad guy or good, and what‚Äôs his plan"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Peter70011,"so when eren kissed historias hand did he see his older self telling his father to do that, or only that his father did it?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tymptra,"Eren kept saying ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better salvation than never having to be born into this world.‚Äù I wonder if that is a clue to what he is going to do? I also noticed the ED depicts locations inside the walls as if they are abandoned... I wonder if Eren's solution is to make it so that all Eldians were never born? Back to 2000 years ago? Or just the current ones...

Grischa did say that his solution was more horrible than he could imagine."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,togavaulter3,This plays back to one of the earlier seasons when ‚Äòthe owl‚Äô mentions Mikasa and Armin when grisha is first given the attack titan. It just never registered until now.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MookaMG,"I'm a little lost
Can someone please explain how Eren's able to control Grisha's past behavior? I know from today's episode that the attack titan can see the memories of its future inheritor. But how does that mean Eren can control Grisha's past actions?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,z-moneyz,"Every time I watch a new ep this season, I just know I‚Äôm going to end up being more confused"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mikesimus300,The VA for Grisha needs an award for this episode. Dude gave the performance of a lifetime.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seekenrun,"I thought the same about Harry Potter time travel which makes the most sense to me. Everything that has happened in the linear observer‚Äôs past will always have happened. So if Eren does something to influence the past, it will always have happened and doesn‚Äôt break the loop."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SorranTheGrey,"Ever since the start of S3 (or maybe even sooner), every episode has just had me thinking ""there's no way they could sink any lower than this, there's no way it could possibly get any worse, right?"" and then just being proven horribly wrong every single time. You think Eren is gonna redeem himself or SOMETHING at some point, but he just keeps going farther and farther down the rabbit hole"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shibbikitteh,"What an episode, I've read enough comments to 100% understand the time travel, and it just explains SO MUCH - Season 3 Finale - Erens change in vigor. ""Everthing is as I saw it in my fathers memories...right? 
So if we kill the enemy, the one waiting for us on the other side. Will we finally be free?"" 
We'll find out soon I think! 

Also, they had no business making Eren so goddamn hot in this episode. It kept distracting me from the heavy info we were receiving. I'm standing with Eren to the end."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,theanonymousdude101,"I'm confused, how did eren change what his father did when it already happened"

""Ha ha! You thought, but it was ME the whole time!"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,powerofkings,"I‚Äôm still a little confused. So the memories Zeke was showing Eren, were they somehow able to actually interact with them like for example Zeke hugging grisha in the memory?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dirtydawg1481,I literally said ‚Äúah fuck‚Äù as soon as the episode ended.  Cliffhangers this season left and right.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tron_1981,"So I'm a little confused, is Eren's beheading just a minor inconvenience?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrShad0wzz,God the episodes keep getting better and better. Spot on translations from the manga too. Mappa has done an amazing job with the adaptation
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cant_hinkofanything,"so zeke thought he tricked Eren then Eren said he was born into this world and lied to zeke, then zeke lied to Eren again, now Eren uno reversed it and tricked zeke, wtf, the ultimate uno game"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shroffinator,"Okay imagine is Eren didn‚Äôt want the Rumbling & just wanted peace. Couldn‚Äôt he have just gone back to beginning like he did, convince an early Attack Titan to take an early founder, do the sterilization plan and end it?

At the very least he could‚Äôve altered the past to make sure his mom survived & people were prepared for the initial wall breach. He wouldn‚Äôt become who he was though which wouldn‚Äôt send him back? Fuck idk"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Johnny20022002,"In season 1 episode 1 mikasa asks eren ‚ÄúAre you still **bound and determined** to be of them...the scouts? English Dub 

In the subbed she says ‚Äúdid that change your mind about joining the scouts‚Äù 

The English dub is hinting at what eren would eventually become with the pause (Titan), and its pointing to the destiny aspect of the story that we see now."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamgoingtointernet,Definitely didn't imagine the wall titans swimming like that
iamgoingtointernet,redchairyellowchair,Yeah my dumbass thought they were walking on the ocean floor
redchairyellowchair,Vegasman20002,"Me too. The displacement of water because of their weight would have been like the parting of the Red Sea. 

Or so i thought"
redchairyellowchair,QuestioningEspecialy,same
redchairyellowchair,cidalkimos,Lol
redchairyellowchair,del_visuals,They were swimming like Olympic champions
iamgoingtointernet,eyeEric,Am pretty sure they use their heat to propel them. Kinda like a rocket.
iamgoingtointernet,MikasaAckerman1996,Fucking hell yeahhh! That scene was mind blowing!!!!
iamgoingtointernet,lunchbag-mermaid,Ngl it looked really silly imo heh
lunchbag-mermaid,matiaskjer,Not like we haven‚Äôt seen titans do wierd shit and act like clowns on crack before though
lunchbag-mermaid,Flaming_Butterfly,"I think the animation for the underwater scenes didn't sell the realism of the swimming titans properly for a few reasons:

1) Scale

There's no point of reference to convey the scale of the titans when they're underwater. The scene right before the steam hits and the first titan silhouette swoops under the giant cruiser is excellent at communicating scale, and the only other notable example is when a titan zooms past the now stationary exploded limbs to communicate their speed. The other underwater scenes have no size or speed reference (i.e. schools of fish speeding across the foreground or a shark getting vaporised).


2) Effect on Environment

The volume and presence of the titans isn't properly highlighted by their effect on the environment. When the Beast titan is first introduced, he crouches down and the wind from his body blows through the trees shortly afterwards to emphasise the magnitude of his presence. It looks silly when the titans are shown swimming because they don't appear to be properly resisted by the water. Given their size, we expect to FEEL the deep *vwoom* *vwoom* as the displaced water from their kicks distorts the scene. We expect to see the missiles produce delayed shockwaves and gurgling bubbles of heat as they hit, and the titans should be bubbling with emitted steam.
Instead, the sound effects are shockingly faint, and the camera pans somewhat disjointedly over the swimming titans as they seem to glide with human-like weight and leave smooth, undistorted trails in the water.


This handful of scenes might be fixed with relative ease if the sounds of the bubbling and heavy swimming are magnified, some delayed water distortion is added to the titans/water trails, and some fish are sprinkled-on as blurs streaking across the foreground."
lunchbag-mermaid,Teves3D,Someone said the use the heat to propel like a rocket.. which makes that scene even more terrifying. Imagine 100m walking nukes‚Ä¶
iamgoingtointernet,drip_watch,"me neither, which makes me wonder.. was eren swimming? i think he might've switched back to his regular titan to swim because i can't imagine that fucking mountain of a titan fucking swimming LOL"
iamgoingtointernet,Kbains01,Yeah it‚Äôs a bit weird to see them swimming lol. You‚Äôd think that they‚Äôre so big that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to float but hey that‚Äôs titans being titans
Kbains01,Comfortable-Sea-1,even colossal titans are insignificant to the ocean's extreme vastness and depth.
Kbains01,jinyu98,"well, logically speaking, wall titans are 50m (164ft), the largest blue whale was 33m (110ft). Whales are massive, but retain amazing water buoyancy. so it‚Äôs not too hard to imagine a colossal titan being able to float/swim üòÖ"
Kbains01,DangerZoneh,also they're probably boiling the water around them creating an air bubble for them to swim in
Kbains01,bloodycups,Aren't Titans very light for their size?  Or is that only in death I remember eye patch girl kicking a head around once
iamgoingtointernet,BitchOfficial,seeing them just kicking along was definitely a highlight
iamgoingtointernet,mcrcuryy,"it was actually funny tbh, big ass 100+ft tall titans ocean diving and flapping their feet"
iamgoingtointernet,TyGuy223,"Dude, I'm so pumped because I totally saw this coming! Although, in my thoughts I thought they should've been doing the back stroke on the water's surface. Let me explain:

1. Titans are supposed to be less dense than humans. If humans float in water then titans definitely should, so it wouldn't make sense for them to walk along the bottom. Maybe they could give themselves some hardened titan shoes to hold them down, but that would be inefficient because of the following.
2. Wall titans have lanky arms and massive feet. Literally the best qualities of a swimmer. They should be able to swim way faster than they could ever walk.
3. Their intense heat means the water will likely instantly boil around them (as we saw) reducing friction and allowing them to swim that much faster.
4. I thought the back stroke could make the most sense if the titans were unable to submerge themselves because of their buoyancy, because then their napes would be more protected from shelling and bombs. Obviously this would be ridiculous, but it was a fun idea to throw around.

All the pacing I did thinking about this now feels totally validated. Man I love this show!"
iamgoingtointernet,del_visuals,Lol bro it was crazy i legit thought they were gonna be walking
iamgoingtointernet,Vaojin,"Omg me too! I cut that out from my reaction video because i thought i was to only one who didn‚Äòt thought about this, glad i‚Äòm not to only one haha"
iamgoingtointernet,Microtic,"Also, how the hell did they aim? The steam?..."
iamgoingtointernet,brayNmik420,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying!!!!!!üòÇüòÇ
iamgoingtointernet,Slightly_Wet_Peas,I think they walked the whole way in the manga but I might be misremembering
iamgoingtointernet,MegaGhostQueen,bro they were zoomin
iamgoingtointernet,shibafrien,it was a bit of an ‚Äúoh wow‚Äù moment
iamgoingtointernet,chickenwontonsoup,"The only thing in my mind when I saw the swimming scene was... here titan fishy fishy fishy~ 

Couldnt take that scene seriously at all"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kbains01,"Did anyone else find the founding titans face more disturbing than they thought it‚Äôd be? üòÇ

The rumbling coming out of the ocean scene was just so intense and the parallels to the start of season 1 and soundtrack was just chefs kiss. 

On a happy note at least we saw everyone be happy even if it was just for one last time."
Kbains01,MikasaAckerman1996,I so loved that scene when everyone was happy and honestly I get it why Eren is doing this...he saw his family being destroyed..and only two friends that he has closest to family...he just want them to be happy! Not saying he is right or wrong...but I definitely get it why he does this...AOT did a commendable job in showing his motivation. üíØ
MikasaAckerman1996,Shanks1130,"Finally, someone with sense. I've been straying off the two AOT subs because people have been fighting like cats and dogs over whether Eren is right or wrong. Isayama told this wonderful story and people are bickering over whether genocide is right or wrong when that was never the point of this story. Never have, never will be."
MikasaAckerman1996,Alphabunsquad,He‚Äôs wrong. But I get it. But he‚Äôs also an idiot for thinking what he‚Äôs doing will achieve what he wants. But also I get it. But also he‚Äôs dumb.
MikasaAckerman1996,michaels1336,People keep forgetting that Eren has the memories of all attack titan users which means he‚Äôs live multiple lifetimes of abuse  not just his own he is the only person that has felt and seen every part of mankind‚Äôs history up to this point there is no reason why what he‚Äôs doing isn‚Äôt justified
MikasaAckerman1996,Significant_Form_253,I agree with Mikasa and co that his genocide still isn't justified.  They're proof you can live through the same thing and act different
Kbains01,SirBing96,Sasha throwing up was hilarious
SirBing96,Kbains01,It was nice to see the old gang back together again
SirBing96,MikasaAckerman1996,Oh yeah we got to see Sasha one last time too! üò¢
Kbains01,TheNewGuyGames,And now all of those people will be crushed by the very person they let into their home. Unless Eren decides to have the titans do a little hop skip and a jump over them...but I doubt it :(
TheNewGuyGames,vindicare1,He said that nothing has happened to them...yet.
TheNewGuyGames,maddogkaz,They only let him into their homes because they didn't know he was an eldian.
TheNewGuyGames,Sponge56,He made the wall titans avoid the people in paradis but yeah probably not everyone has to go
Kbains01,alfalfafex,"I was and still am hyped even now because of all the info we got this episode and how it ended off, eren repeating what he said back in season 1...with imo one of the best soundtracks that we last heard only from annie, Bertholdt and reiners appearances in season 1 and 2

Ngl i feel bad for eren even tho he is the ""bad guy"" here. He values his friends and people on paradis so much that he doesnt care that he only has 4 years left, he just wants to die knowing that his friends and the others will be safe and this time we saw the lengths that eren would go( self mutilation) and we even saw that eren still has emotions when we saw him cry (probably because he realizes that innocent people will have to die if they can't make peace)

""this world is cruel, but it is also beautiful"" - mikasa"
Kbains01,Different-Ad3276,The episode was wholesome until we saw Titans playing Warship and crushing poor Marleyans.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thisguyisnotyou,Levi in a suit was something I did not expect üî•
thisguyisnotyou,AngleThat8380,No body is talking about the Joker straight up bullying Levi.
AngleThat8380,vindicare1,That thing was legit the scariest thing in the show and it's existence alone excuses ominicide if that means the clowns dead.
AngleThat8380,MikasaAckerman1996,Hahahaha oh yeah that scene was hilarious üòÇ
AngleThat8380,Meanteenbirder,I want the screencap to be the cover photo for the sub
AngleThat8380,FunnyDifficulty6,">Joker straight up bullying Levi.

The joke calling him ""kid"" was the best part for me"
thisguyisnotyou,TheNewGuyGames,Levi being called a kid playing a ganger was something I did not expect to happen. I was waiting for him to send that clown 20 feet into the air hahaha
TheNewGuyGames,Sponge56,I really wanted him to this clown has no idea that Levi has cut up monsters bigger than the buildings around him how dare he disrespect our main man
TheNewGuyGames,aheze,That man literally a ü§° though
thisguyisnotyou,Mybitchmyhoemyhoemy,Did he like literally get a foot shorter? I know he‚Äôs always been shorter but why did it look off in this episode
Mybitchmyhoemyhoemy,1234NY,"Attack on Titan and having wildly inconsistent proportions for its characters and creatures, NAMID."
Mybitchmyhoemyhoemy,CretinInPeril,"He's five foot exact, I think, due to the malnutrition when he was a kid. He's always been super short but it was definitely exaggerated here and in the manga for the sake of comedy

Edit: I misread, thought you meant only in the clown scene he looked off"
thisguyisnotyou,MikasaAckerman1996,He was hot AF
thisguyisnotyou,ShaidarHaran2,"Levi saving that kid though, god I live the OG crew"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoosySucker69,"Eren was crying before he had that conversation with Mikasa? Was he crying because he already knew the answer or because he thought about thr fate of those refugees?
A question we can ponder upon. What a goddamn depressing episode. Eren's face broke me."
PoosySucker69,GoBlueDevils4,Didn‚Äôt he say to Mikasa that nothing had happened to the refugee boy‚Ä¶ yet. Or something like that? I took it as him sympathizing with the refugees because they‚Äôre innocent people who are being treated horribly like the Eldians. But he also knows they‚Äôre all going to get crushed in the Rumbling which is why he had the tears.
GoBlueDevils4,SillyLilHobbit,That is what I believe to be the case as well.
GoBlueDevils4,Kappa_Swaggins,"Connect it with earlier in the episode when he was like, ""This is the other side of the sea."" It was a direct reference to the end of season 3, when he said his enemies were on the other side of the sea. Now he makes it there, and he finds no enemies, just normal people. Then he finds the refugee camp, people he empathizes with even more. He is heartbroken to realize that all of these people are going to be killed, by him. AKA, it's easier to kill people that you don't understand, the same dilemma that Reiner found on Paradis.

The timing of when he left also shows a bit more of what he was thinking. He wanted to listen to the sympathizers for Subject of Ymir, to see if there was any chance of the island not being hated. But the moment he hears hateful things being thrown at Paradis, he decides there is no alternative but to move forward with the plan."
GoBlueDevils4,DrDrewBlood,I took it as their fate is inevitable either way. All the ‚Äúisland devils‚Äù are gone and now everyone is cool with subjects of Ymir? Nope. The refugees are just next in line once the island is gone.
PoosySucker69,matthieuC,"He sees people who remind him of he and his friends.  
And he knows he's going to kill them."
matthieuC,Relative_Condition_4,"this exactaly. I don't think he's having ""flashes"" like what happened when he kissed historias hand. Thats when he saw a giant amount of snippets from past and future, so i would rather think that eren was crying due to a combo of factors: the pocket picker boy symbolizes most of them in what i think was a great analogy by isayama. The boy have been humiliated for his origins and his kin lived in a sorta separated place from the big shipping town. Eren probably knew they would later chill together in those tents and thought that sometime soon he would brutally massacre them, Not the easiest thought to have is it?"
PoosySucker69,Pardusco,I think he was sympathizing with them since they were also oppressed people.
Pardusco,Mybitchmyhoemyhoemy,"Agreed. I think he saw Paradis in them, which is why he was inclined to go join them"
PoosySucker69,MikasaAckerman1996,I feel it was the empathy he felt for those people because he could relate how Eldians suffer because they are boycotted from the world too!
PoosySucker69,myunfortunatelife,"I assumed it was because he knew he was going to end up killing them, hence the ""not yet"""
PoosySucker69,therainbowdasher,"Grisha said he saw the rumbling through Eren, Eren gave himself Grisha's memories when he kissed Historia. He's crying and looks sad the entire time because he's thinking how he's going to kill all these people."
PoosySucker69,ShaidarHaran2,"I was pretty sure he was crying seeing the refugees, sympathizing with them, but knowing he was going to crush them all the same"
PoosySucker69,Prof_Black,"Eren was getting ready to say goodbye to Mikasa and everyone else.

Zeke confirms it that Mikasa loves Eren and Eren knows it. But he cant go there because he only has 4 years left."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vegasman20002,"Floch: Eren told me about his plan!

Me: bullshit

Floch today: suck it, vegasman20002."
Vegasman20002,Insane_Inkster,Omg so true! I called bullshit on that and now I'm so shocked.
Vegasman20002,jediwizard7,I'm more surprised that Historia knew the whole time and didn't say anything. I guess that's why she's been so distant this whole time
jediwizard7,JMeerkat137,I think she only found out right before Eren went to enact it. I might be wrong but judging from the clothing he‚Äôs wearing I think it‚Äôs right after he‚Äôs freed from jail
Vegasman20002,Fichen,"I gave Floch the benefit of the doubt the hole time, but I still don't think Eren wanted Folch to create an almost fascist regime. I have a feeling that Floch used his knowlege from Eren to give himself a lot of power."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tralfamadorian6,goddamn that clown was fucking creepy
Tralfamadorian6,Korrathelastavatar,Right?! What the fuck was that lol. I was expecting it to be like Kenny or something lol
Korrathelastavatar,kimbolll,It‚Äôs actually foreshadowing. Attack on Titan: The Final Season *Forealzies* Part 69 opens with us discovering Kenny possesses the Clown Titan (the power of which is seeing the memories of past and future five year old birthday parties).
Tralfamadorian6,dotdotdotgov,why does every anime have to have a clown in it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Longjumping_Major984,"Damn it, the man who decided to call season 4 the final one really wanted to troll us all! 

I feel like a fool."
Longjumping_Major984,hipphipphan,The first episode of season 4 came out in 2020. A single season is taking 3 years to release lol

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Obeselump,"the flashback made me so damn sad oh my god.. seeing sasha again was just AHH!!

it did make me think though, how much would have changed if mikasa confessed to him back then, would make a good ova!

i'll see you guys in 2023 :sob:"
Obeselump,aboubou22,"I was puzzled AF because I thought it was Gabi and not Sasha so I was like ""wtf is happening?"" üòÇüòÇ"
aboubou22,spicydrip,SAME hahaha
Obeselump,Prof_Black,Sasha seeing a car and calling it a cow.
Obeselump,Zapdo0dlz,Same  seeing them all asleep together warmed my heart then shattered it knowing it was probably the last time. Whyyyy
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheNewGuyGames,"It put a smile on my face to see the gang having fun with the refugees, and it was interesting to see Eren's actions once he set foot in Marley. To me, it seemed he had reservations about what he knew he was going to do. It also appeared that he was testing the future that he saw. ""perfect timing"", when the rest of the people found him talking to Mikasa I think implies that theory. As well as him attending the announcement for the Subjects of Ymir foundation, he wanted to believe that it would go a different way. When he saw that it wouldn't, he left and began the plan.  
  
Great to see Historia again. I imagined we'd see what's been going on in that neck of the woods, but I have been waiting for it. Interesting that Eren told her his plans. Could he have even changed her mind with the founding titan considering she has noble blood? If he couldn't, does that mean she's going along with his plan, or at least keeping quiet about it? I wont even get into whether or not he's the one that put a bun in the oven.  
  
I loved the conversation with Zeke. Eren actually had a true brotherly conversation. Eren truly could not fathom the idea that Mikasa may love him to such an extreme degree that he came up with the theory of an Ackerman protecting their ""host"". Cool to see the origin of that and further proves that he was trying to push her away so that she could go on without him.  
  
Okay, the last 5 minutes of the episode. Holy. SHIT. I don't know what's more gruesome, what Eren did to himself in the paths, or what he did to himself in the trenches. No matter his choices, that is some damn conviction right there. The swimming titans was sort of hilarious and equally terrifying. The Navy getting burnt from the steam was brutal and badass and awful all at the same time. Then the final shot of Eren behind the titan army, holy shit. I'd try to give myself the Reiner special if I saw that thing coming towards me.  
  
""Season 4"" part 3 hype! More frog meme AoT Sundays! 2023!....fuck!"
TheNewGuyGames,kamarajitsu,"""Reiner special"" üòÇ"
kamarajitsu,TheNewGuyGames,I'm ashamed to say that I laughed too much at my own joke when I typed that hahaha.
TheNewGuyGames,Envy_onTHE_Toast,I think Historia mentioning her being pregnant was her way of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a kid so I won‚Äôt go along with Zeke‚Äôs plan and will let you carry out yours‚Äù but I could be wrong
Envy_onTHE_Toast,TheNewGuyGames,Might be true. Sadly to know the answer I'll either need to read the manga or wait a year :(
TheNewGuyGames,ruri-san,"Wait, so the whole Ackermans having special powers was made up? Or only the things Eren said to her her being born to protect him? 

It's so hard to remember all the details and what's been told vs what's actually true ü•≤"
ruri-san,TheNewGuyGames,"Their powers and how they awaken is the real deal. Their soul purpose being to protect someone as Eren said, however, is false. It seemed that that was simply a theory that Eren came up with to explain Mikasa's feelings towards him since he could not imagine that she loved him that much."
TheNewGuyGames,AC-Hawkmoon,Can you explain what was happening in the trenches?
AC-Hawkmoon,TheNewGuyGames,"That was showing Eren after he left his group of Islanders. He infiltrated the Marley army's Eldian fighters or w/e they are called. Then, once in the field, he cut his own leg off and shoved a bullet into his eye. Avoiding using the power of the titan to heal up so that he would be perceived as too injured and thus allowed to stay at the hospital within the intermittent zone.  
  
TL;DR. He joined the enemy army like Reiner/Bugfoldt/Annie did and then fucked himself up so that he could stay in their hospital. Andddd queue season 4 part 1 ep1."
TheNewGuyGames,nelson_manvella,"> what Eren did to himself in the paths, or what he did to himself in the trenches. 

I didn't really get this part, care to explain?"
nelson_manvella,TheNewGuyGames,"Copying this from a previous reply.

TheNewGuyGames,DexQ,"He can definitely change Historia‚Äôs mind. Remember Frieda did the same to Historia?
Actually those noble bloodlines within the walls are bloodlines that are NOT subject of Ymir, and this is why founding titan power could not affect them."
DexQ,TheNewGuyGames,Right! I forgot that Frieda would make Historia forget her.
DexQ,luceafaruI,"Yes but he needs to touch a titan with royal blood to wipe memories. Without that, he cannot use the founder's abilities"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"It‚Äôs nice seeing eren formulate his plans in the second half of the episode. Talking to yelena, floch and historia and seeing how they oppose or sympathise with him. What makes erens plan even sadder is he clearly empathises with the people outside of the walls, tho to him there‚Äôs no other valid options to save paradise."
Couch-Dogo,zzxxccbbvn,"This is what I don't understand about Eren's motivations. At times he makes it seem like he's committing genocide out of necessity rather than vengeance, while at other times making it seem like he's doing it purely out of vengeance"
zzxxccbbvn,Couch-Dogo,"I mean it could be a bit of both, people rarely do things for only one reason. It‚Äôs vengeance against marley for the destruction of paradise and the necessity that the rest of the world is on board with destroying paradise so they need to be destroyed first. It‚Äôs also the necessity to stop the circle of violence by destroying anyone outside the walls so that they can‚Äôt then take vengeance against paradise."
zzxxccbbvn,Lowtan,Why not both?
zzxxccbbvn,Vegasman20002,"That's the beauty of it. In real life who has a single motivation for doing anything, no matter what it is?"
zzxxccbbvn,daskrip,"Yeah it sometimes feels like a contradiction. Here's how I see it. 

Eren carries unbridled rage at anyone threatening his friends' lives or freedoms. That ""anyone"" happens to include innocent people like that refugee boy - if any piece of civilization survives The Rumbling, they become a liability, and a potential source of an uprising against ""the devils"". So Eren's rage extends even to those peaceful people that up till now never harbored an ounce of resentment against the Eldians.

However, Eren is now able to take a step back and view his rage objectively. He's even able to have love for the people he knows he will kill. He has this duality of loving those refugees but still wanting nothing more than for them to die. He knows that his rage can't be controlled, and he'll never prioritize anyone over his Eldian friends."
zzxxccbbvn,flappydicks,"At this point, it‚Äôs more protection for his friends to have a happy life with kids. At the expense and destruction of the outside world. But he tells Reiner that it‚Äôs not about vengeance anymore before he goes off on Marley the first time.

I need to rewatch to completely to understand for myself."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoohBearing,"Damn, Eren was actually happy. I can't remember the last time, or if we've ever seen him truly happy. And it might just be the final time. 

:("
PoohBearing,knifeazz,I almost didn‚Äôt recognize him when he was smiling. It‚Äôs been that long since we‚Äôve seen him happy
PoohBearing,QuestioningEspecialy,">  I can't remember the last time, or if we've ever seen him truly happy.

When he finally balanced himself with the maneuvering gear (that needed recalibration)?"
QuestioningEspecialy,TheNoseKnight,It needed to be replaced since Keith Shadis sabotaged it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"Damn the last part of this episode is brutal, watching eren cut off his leg and pierce his eye with pure twisted determination in his eyes was horrifying. Then to see the fright he now puts the rest of the world through with the same anger in the face of his absolutely gigantic titan was amazing. Do those guys really thing there gonna outrun those titans? 

I will also admit watching the colossals swim was kinda funny, surely they could have just walked across the bottom of the sea instead."
Couch-Dogo,EternalCanadian,"They probably could have walked on the ocean floor, but then they wouldn‚Äôt have been able to attack the ships.

If they missed even one ship that ship could have probably bombed Paradis to the Stone Age, or possibly caused a lot more damage to the Titans once they reached the shore."
EternalCanadian,spacecadet0226,Did they attack the ships or did they just boil them all with their heat?
Couch-Dogo,No_Championship_5162,I mean would you not at least try to run if you saw something like that. Human nature is fight or flight
Couch-Dogo,Rioma117,"Yeah, I really don't understand why they decided to hold a naval fight when they could've use the terrain and kill as many titans as they could on land."
Rioma117,Couch-Dogo,"Well I mean if you have all those ships laying around you may as well use them. Tho I still feel the land defence was severely lacking, surely they could have got some more cannons from all those nations."
Couch-Dogo,KarmaPoIice,I‚Äôve kinda half paid attention to some episodes so I didn‚Äôt understand why eren was cutting his leg off. Care to explain?
KarmaPoIice,IntroductionTight775,still here wondering
Couch-Dogo,ChewchewMotherFF,"I just binged the show and finished it this evening. 
I‚Äôm a little lost on why he inflicted those wounds upon himself. Simply to be admitted into the hospital? Aren‚Äôt there others with lesser injuries in the same hospital as Eren? Perhaps I missed something !"
ChewchewMotherFF,Couch-Dogo,"Well yeah the wounds are to get him into the hospital. I believe it‚Äôs also to help with his cover. When you can regrow limbs at an instant it‚Äôs hard to imagine that a titan shifter would go around with such bad injuries, so by having them people aren‚Äôt gonna expect eren to be a titan shifter and instead just think of him as an injured soldier."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CHEFKOCH38x,"Mikasa, man, just say the words ily to him...poor Eren"
CHEFKOCH38x,TheNewGuyGames,"Eren: What am I to you?  
Mikasa: Ereh  
Eren: ...who the heck is Ereh"
CHEFKOCH38x,A_Wild_Gorgon,She blew it so hard
A_Wild_Gorgon,Joshuah_Airbender,"Naaaa, if she had done that there would be no rumbling."
CHEFKOCH38x,IndianCurry30,Cockblock of the century this episode
IndianCurry30,jaylikesdominos,AoT staying the most asexual anime of all time
CHEFKOCH38x,flappydicks,Would he have changed his mind tho?
flappydicks,Ok_Chicken1370,"Eren stated in this episode that everything happened because he wanted it to, so no, I don't think Mikasa would have changed his mind."
CHEFKOCH38x,ShaidarHaran2,"That wouldn't have changed the outcome, I think Eren was just trying to root out what her attachment to him was to undo it, so that she can live a life after he's gone."
CHEFKOCH38x,SissorX,I feel like her decision is what drove him to do what he did. If she said she loved him I think the turn out would‚Äôve been completely different. That moment felt very pivotal when I seen it.
SissorX,kokotreenut,"Did you watch Mikasa's OVA? >!The main takeaway was that anything done differently would end in the same fate.!< So, I disagree."
SissorX,failbears,"Why is he so hung up on this, and asking Zeke about it too?"
SissorX,ijswizzlei,Damn so he did all this because he got friendzoned?
SissorX,Fichen,"I think that's only what Mikasa belived. She thinks that she could have done something right then and there, and she feels guilty about it. But I don't think she is right, I think Eren was so commited to his plan at that moment, that nothing would have changed his decision.  


But I don't know, mabye you and Mikasa are right."
SissorX,zzthechampion,"It is so tragic because her love is the only thing that I think he would have considered more valuable than the guaranteed peace that his Rumbling aims to achieve. If she said  I love you, he would have done what he needed to to make her feel loved but the fact she didnt need him was enough for him to know she will be happy eventually. 
Damn I am so sad"
CHEFKOCH38x,sherlockOnDrugs,[Eren taking rejection like](https://imgur.com/a/8S0VU32)
CHEFKOCH38x,AngleThat8380,Just reminds me of the scene of issei with rias about what is she to him. Anime is high school dxd if you are wondering.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gm1504,"Idk what to say mappa did an amazing work i'm so hyped for the next season, potato girl so sweet as always, levi understood the boy as he lived the same way, amazing final ep, can't wait see y'all in 2023."
Gm1504,QuestioningEspecialy,"> levi understood the boy as he lived the same way,

Shit, I didn't make that connection."
QuestioningEspecialy,awesomlyawesome,Gotta keep ya eye out for connections on attack on titan. They aren't in your face with it but the characters are diverse enough that you can understand the reasoning in their actions and make the correlation. Thats why I love this anime.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheKie1Wee,"Levi looking like Kenny and being called a kid had me laughing, and seeing all the group partying and happy was so wholesome. Then the complete 180 seeing Mikasa blame herself, Eren hurt Historia and seeing the founder finally animated was unreal! 

Bummed we have to wait til '23 for the conclusion but was expecting it honestly"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fella_mcflips,Ymir had to wait 2000 years for Eren and now we have to wait about the same time for part 3üòì
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thisguyisnotyou,Watching everyone getting drunk was so wholesome ngl
thisguyisnotyou,hk0202,Made me tear up a bit cause I realized they‚Äôre really all just a bunch of young people who had their lives destroyed and never had a chance to do the simple things like that
hk0202,Gold_cheetah102,SO true and So sad :(
thisguyisnotyou,Kuhlayre,It honestly made the realisation of what Eren was doing that much worse. The juxtaposition was perfection.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,redchairyellowchair,2023!!! No!! Can't believe it
redchairyellowchair,Trediciost,"I can easily wait for that long, but having to go that long without encountering any spoilers is gonna be hard, I'm getting spoiled on like every platform avaiable, tiktok, youtube, reddit, twitter etc. Might just have to read the manga"
Trediciost,spacecadet0226,Yeah dude dodging spoilers has taken on a new art form in and of itself like once the algorithm picks up that you‚Äôre a massive fan your recommended feed turns into a field of spoiler landmines.
Trediciost,Sponge56,I don‚Äôt read a lot of manga I prefer animations but aot is definitely worth the read and aren‚Äôt their theory‚Äôs that the anime might have a different ending? If so definitely read the manga ending first and get the full experience if anything does change
Trediciost,russmankiwi,"Over these last two cours I‚Äôve tried to avoid AoT YouTube videos like the plague, but occasionally I‚Äôll give in and watch one discussion video only to refresh YT and see 5 spoiler heavy thumbnails.

I feel like I have a pretty good gist of how it‚Äôs gonna end due to these unexpected spoilers and it‚Äôs now a debate if I want to save myself for the animation or just give in to the manga"
redchairyellowchair,Praziken,"It would mark the 10th year anniversary of the anime, so I think it's fitting imo."
redchairyellowchair,NoDadNoTears,"yeah, AoT can kind of fuck off with this lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaimeM,"I might be in the minority but I'm really glad there will be new episodes and not a movie. I think it's best when works of fiction keep the same format throughout personally.

Really sad we'll have to wait for a full year though.

The episode was really really good. I am glad we could finally see more of Eren's motivations and some inner dialogue with Mikasa.

I did not understand fully the conversation with Historia though, but that's on me. Is Eren the father?"
MaimeM,HOHOHAHAREBORN,"I had to watch it twice to understand.

Eren said no to Zeke's plan because he wants his friends to live a long life AND have kids. That's the strong implication in the way the scenes and dialogues are structured.

They don't reveal a thing about who is the father, but honestly it COULD and it also COULDN'T be Eren. Eren's affection for Historia comes from Grisha eating Frida and Eren eating Grisha. Frida cared for Historia as a sister so idk if Eren would necessarily want to bang her. It could all be wrong tho cos there's nothing normal about Aot."
HOHOHAHAREBORN,Samtheman0425,"Eren's affection doesn't come from eating Grisha, it comes from being saved by Historia."
MaimeM,Vegasman20002,"Agreed. I would much rather have a series. Take the time to do it right.

But please drop them all at once!"
Vegasman20002,Pardusco,I hate weekly shows. I'm not a 9 year old watching Pokemon on Saturday morning anymore!
Vegasman20002,Sponge56,But wouldn‚Äôt they have taken the same time to make a movie but with a bigger budget?
MaimeM,MapleJacks2,"I don't think he's the father, I'm pretty sure she's just one of the few people who might understand him."
MapleJacks2,MaimeM,"But she mentioned she would get pregnant, and I didn't understand why she said that"
MaimeM,NoU1337420,"i agree but i don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôd pace it all in another 12 episodes, it seems too long for the amount of content left. i‚Äôm not sure how planning out seasons for  tv and stuff works but i‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs difficult to get out of the fixed 12 or 24 episode season length."
NoU1337420,WestSixtyFifth,It's all one season technically and if it's the end of the series they'll let them release it however they please.
MaimeM,HexZer0,">Is Eren the father?

That would be a cool twist. Cotton Eyed Joe is probably the baby daddy though."
MaimeM,JPastori,"Yeah same, while a movie wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be bad it‚Äôll be what? 2 hours? That‚Äôs not a lot of time to wrap everything up. Without giving any spoilers I read the manga after part 1 ended and they still have a lot to get through."
MaimeM,SecondRealitySims,"Eh, I disagree on the movie part. I‚Äôm sick of them just constantly cutting the season up into parts. The ‚Äòfinal season‚Äô has just become three stuffed in one. Besides that, I just thought a compact, well-animated movie would be perfect. Perhaps it‚Äôs because of my experience waiting for the JJK0 film. Plus it probably would have massive. Both JJK0 and Mugen Train were ridiculously popular and profitable. Taking a series like AoT and tying the finale into a film? It‚Äôd set a new standard"
SecondRealitySims,paulusmagintie,"New standard? Last airbenders finale is considered a movie, look up sozens comet.

Endibgs should not be tied to a movie for anything, i hate how halo kills bad guys in comics after you fight them in game, it ruins the story, Mass effect brought in a comic bad guy to 3 and lots of complaints because it seemed to be an arse pull.

Keep it all together"
MaimeM,Knox230902,"Imagine how many times Eren Yeager saw future while ""touching"" Historia (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó-)‚úß"
Knox230902,StatisticianAware588,Flashes of the rumbling during moments of intimacy...well that sucks. ü•≤
MaimeM,Youtube-Gerger,It implied it pretty hard ngl
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kobeissi2,"""You're the baddest girl in the world"" Lol what"
Kobeissi2,HereButQueer,Eren thinks Historia a baddie lmaooo
HereButQueer,Merchant_seller,Mikasa fuming rn
HereButQueer,AngleThat8380,She was. Just rewatch season 3. Just after she realised that she can't lie to herself she just smashed her father on the floor.
Kobeissi2,biased_intruder,"Reference to what she says when she freed him from the chain ""I'm the worst enemy humanity has"" or something like that (I think)"
Kobeissi2,Qpczyk,"Bad translation, In manga it is Worst not the Baddest and it's callback to what Historia said in S3 EP 7."
Kobeissi2,TheChrisLambert,What subtitles were you using? On Hulu it was ‚Äúworst girl‚Äù which was a callback to when she saved him in the cave
TheChrisLambert,Frenchymemez,"Same on funimation. But they posted this like 3 hours ago, so chances are they use an illegal streaming site which is subtitled by someone using Google translate"
Kobeissi2,midmidmidmidmidmid,Reference to when she freed him instead of eating him
Kobeissi2,TheNewGuyGames,It's a reference to when she called herself the worst girl in the world. She said that she's the #1 enemy of humanity. Something like that when she's freeing him from the place under the church.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheDefinitionOfKek,"Holy. Shit. That was a banger cliffhanger. I'm glad we're getting a part 3 and not a movie. That was so awesome!! Eren's founding titan, the music, the animation, it was all so amazing. God bless MAPPA for the work they've done so far

I can't believe they showed Eren cutting off his leg, that was brutal!"
TheDefinitionOfKek,RIPBlueRaven,Honestly a movie wouldnt be so bad. But most likely it would be a rushed hour and a half movie. I feel like 2 hours could probably get nearly a whole season
RIPBlueRaven,tannerpet,"Imagine going to the midnight showing of an AOT movie. think of how insanely hype everyone would be 

UGH I WISH IT WAS A MOVIE"
TheDefinitionOfKek,fist_my_muff2,"After the success of Demon Slayer and JJK movies, I was shocked they wouldn't do the same."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pardusco,"I'm so glad they did a flashback on their time in Marley. It just seemed like that would be too important for them to leave out. This episode answers why we saw Jean in Marley in s4, episode 1. He probably read the news saying that the Mid-East lost, and thought ""it's time."" Eren is clearly not xenophobic towards the entire world, since he sought out that Middle Eastern kid and became friends with his family. Yes, I understand that the conference completely demoralized him, but the jump from ""dude who sympathizes with other oppressed people"" to a genocidal maniac is pretty extreme.

This episode confirms that he made that Ackerman shit up. Just trying to come up with reasons why Mikasa was so attached to him. Seems like he accepted that he doesn't have a future with his friends.

I did not know titans were that good at swimming lol. Nothing much to say about The Rumbling itself. Those dudes had the best weapons in the world and could do nothing. How tf can the alliance do anything??? It's over."
Pardusco,cdazzlesockmonkey,"So im left feeling some kind of way about the lie to mikasa about the headaches, he pushed her away so she didn't hurt as much I guess"
cdazzlesockmonkey,Mookies_Bett,"Yeah it seems like Eren is basically trying to intentionally push her away so she can live a normal life with someone else. He knows that best case scenario he only gets 3-4 years with her max, and would rather save her the heart break of having to spend the rest of her life alone. He'd rather have Mikasa hate him and move on with her life so she can be happy than be with her and cause her the pain of him dying so young without her. 

Also probably makes it easier for him to execute the whole ""mass genocide of the entire planet"" thing. Push all his friends away so he can protect them through means they themselves would find despicable. It's just sad. Dude has spent his whole life since he was a little kid being traumatized by death, war, and violence. It's no surprise his worldview is all kinds of fucked up and that he feels justified in what he's doing even though he knows it's wrong. Watching your loved ones die horribly from a young age and then being given all the tragic memories of several lifetimes worth of oppression will do that to a motherfucker. As wrong as it is morally, I really, *really* can't blame Eren for feeling like this is literally his only option to keep his friends and loved ones safe."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,festival-papi,"I like that someone's finally thinking about Eren's change from loud-mouthed sociopath to a solemn, almost stoic shell of his former self. Like did you see that look on his face when he saw Marley, it wasn't like anyone else's, it was intense for awhile.

Overall, another great episode. I like everyone's reaction to being in what to them seems like a whole new world and their party with the refugees. I especially loved the little hints that at this point in time, Eren's still dealing with what he saw and wrestling with the idea that it's fate.

I'm glad we finally saw Historia again and that but man oh man, Eren's expression while explain everything to Zeke and then us finally seeing him cut off his leg and gouge out his eye, was....*chef's kiss*. Also, did anyone else peep his face during the flashback to Sasha's death? I like how we see it's one of shock and horror, I didn't like how his laugh in the sub sounded genuine, dub did it better.

And the Rumbling, good god it's just as terrifying as I'd hoped. An unstoppable force and an unmovable object at the same time wielded by the most dangerous man in the world. Eren's Founding Titan up close looks great. At first, I didn't like it but now I kinda enjoy how it looks barely human."
festival-papi,Vegasman20002,Where in the timeline did that visit take place?
Vegasman20002,AngleThat8380,Before eren ran away to do his own thing. Like giving Reiner a heart attack and eating willy for dinner and drinking Lara juice.

festival-papi,mertcanhekim,"> I like that someone's finally thinking about Eren's change from loud-mouthed sociopath to a solemn, almost stoic shell of his former self.

That's how Anakin's transition into Vader should've been"
festival-papi,nopoliticpls,"I don't think he's ever been a sociopath, and still isn't now. He's an extremely passionate individual who has a deep sense of right vs. wrong, and what it takes to help his people survive from this brutal war that Marley has waged on them."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Couch-Dogo,"The first half of the episode make me so happy and warm inside. Watching the gang freak out about the wider world and have there last bit of fun together feeding cars, eating ice cream and drinking with refugees was so nice to watch. It‚Äôs been a so long since we‚Äôve seen them all so happy, especially eren. Only for it to be ruined by the so called helpers of eldians who demonise paradise even more, leading eren down his path now."

A day after the episode with Eren transforming into the founding titan came out, i already looked up the manga once, but in the end i had the strenght to resist and closed it after just one panel.
But that was only because I knew there was just one week until the next episode.

I don't know if I am strong enough now :("

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdeQ217,"I loved this, it's really cool to clearly see Eren's motivations and how they developed as he experienced the world, I also really liked Mikasa this episode, it's nice to see her contribute to showcasing how Eren changed and what could've gone differently, like if Mikasa said how she felt at that moment and then they went to get drunk in the most wholesome way possible I feel like Eren wouldn't have turned to the Rumbling, he would have finally felt some pure happiness in the cruel world. 
Btw did Sasha force a child to drink booze or was I imagining things?"
AdeQ217,daddyslilmonstah,She did
Temporary_Plan1055,KriegMain,"I think he did this to appear as a wounded soldier to get around Marley easier. In the earlier parts of S4 he had that crutch and eyepatch, that's probably why he did that. As for the turning into a titan I'm not sure. Maybe he can just control it better now."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoohBearing,"The fact that even if the titans merely miss stepping on you, you'll just be incinerated by the steam anyway is horrific."
PoohBearing,ShaidarHaran2,"That makes a lot more sense vis-√†-vis destroying the whole world outside the walls. If it was just the titans stepping on things they'd surely miss a fair deal of humans and never be able to get each one, it would just reset civilization but people with the same ideas would be out there. 

But no...They steam anything they miss. Terrifying. 

But this also means they're going to destroy all plant life and animal life...Guess Eren doesn't know much about ecology or the environment! Can Paradis even survive if he fucks up most of the trees out there?"
ShaidarHaran2,Op_Anadyr,Were they still steaming when they were walking or was it just when they were in the ocean? Because when bertolotolotol steamed he lost muscle mass pretty quickly
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yessauce,It was great seeing eren again. This episode was simultaneously wholesome and depressing. I can't wait until the actual finale!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadZeus007,"so 2023 will be the TRUE Final season and Final season part 1 and 2 were just really disingenuous marketing ploys...

Not complaining about getting more AOT, but they should have called the seasons what they are... Season 4, 5 and then the final season.

Truly absurd..."
DeadZeus007,FrostyD7,"Honestly I don't care what they call them, just communicate to the fans what your doing.  When you add the late notice, it comes off as a sleazy business decision.  They waited until the absolute last moment, lots of fans won't know its not ending until they get confused by the inevitable cliffhanger."
FrostyD7,JasonLikesCTE,Yea that was me last year. In the last two weeks i was like ummmm how are they wrapping this up?
DeadZeus007,DottComm2863,you fool! 2024 will be attack on titan: in space!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Category-Square,Is it me or the quality has went up a notch and mikasa looked a bit more feminine like she used it to be.
Category-Square,Pardusco,She looked pretty asf here.
Category-Square,sundownsundays,"It seems they definitely pooled time for this episode.

That's my guess for why there's a part 3. They want to pool as much time for it as possible to really sell every scene in the final sequences. I'm a manga reader and I can assure you that nothing in the final episodes will be easy to animate, and I can't wait to see what MAPPA is capable of when given enough time."
Category-Square,Cimricek,"Maybe she looked femine because she was part of a ""normal"" world again. Not being forced to be a child soilder and everything.

War changes people. I know that mostly mentaly, but it reflects on the physical appearnce as well, somewhat.

I liked that durning tough times she looked rough. And durning this she looked... ""normal femine"""
Category-Square,pinkiepie_notabrony,I have read somewhere that the author draws Mikasa ‚Äúprettier‚Äù whenever we are seeing her through Eren‚Äôs POV
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Trediciost,"Obviously don't comment on this question if you have read the manga. NO SPOILERS/HINTS. But where is eren really? Like usually their bodies sit in their nape but Erens titan really doesnt have one even. Unless I guess he is inside the bones, then idk"
Trediciost,AIias1431,"Not a manga reader but I guess it's something to do with paths, we saw Zeke got swallowed up by those weird spinal cord things when Eren started the Rumbling in episode 5, since he probably isn't in the actual body they might both just chilling in paths or something"
Trediciost,cdazzlesockmonkey,Not a manga reader but  the only space big enough I assume would be his head or something?? Been bugging me too üòÇ
cdazzlesockmonkey,Twindo,He‚Äôs still enormous. His ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù is relatively thin compared to his size but he still has ample room in this titan‚Äôs nape to house his human body.
Trediciost,DrPikachu-PhD,"Tbh considering what we saw happen with his spine, I assumed that rather than a Titan transformation where he's in the neck this is actually just what Eren looks like now. That basically he's become the founder. Def could be wrong tho."
Trediciost,Ok_Chicken1370,"He might be in the bones or the head, but he does have the Warhammer titan, so I imagine he could put himself anywhere he wants as long as there's a connection to the titan body itself."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nikee242,10/10 ep fo sure
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VeniceRapture,"I'm glad we got a flashback episode to see Eren's perspective. You can tell the whole time Eren was like 
""Armin, this peace talk of yours better work cause if it doesn't I'm taking over"" lol

Even though Eren didn't really try to make that plan work. His father's memories really messed him up"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Savant_OW,Where are you people watching the new episode this early?
Savant_OW,iamgoingtointernet,I stayed up until midnight to watch the release on NHK
Savant_OW,redchairyellowchair,Turn on your tv and it's on channel 1 (Japan)
redchairyellowchair,Savant_OW,Do you know where i can watch with subtitles?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,"can't believe i have to wait a year, possibly more, to see levi again, smh."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mr_sumo,I just realized we‚Äôre going to get A NEW OPENING THEME SONG for next season üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Knox230902,"Tbh.. i cried like a baby watching Sasha and gang be soo happy in the mid part, that part was heart touching. Man, i loved that Indian style ost and everything!! This episode gonna break some ""walls"" of the internet."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vickyroseann,"When historia said ‚Äúif i don‚Äôt do everything i can to stop you, then i can‚Äôt live a life to be proud of‚Äù i cried. so fucking hard"
vickyroseann,midmidmidmidmidmid,Then she immediately bailed
midmidmidmidmidmid,matthieuC,"This was a bit confusing.  
She did not do anything to stop him, heck she helped his plan by getting pregnant."
vickyroseann,slutforsweetea,It‚Äôs what Ymir would have wanted
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fred42069,Finally seeing Mikasa's arc come around is such a nice thing to see. and that ending was absolutely incredible. I just can't believe we have to wait even longer now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Brokeness__,IS EREN THE DADDY???
Brokeness__,spacecadet0226,"Nah, they showed that scene of Historia walking in to seduce the stable boy iirc when we first find out she‚Äôs pregnant.

But now we have more context for that scene, I‚Äôm imagining she made a beeline straight for the barn after talking to Eren lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,licheepuffbar,"Finally hearing the attack titan theme after so long was such good payoff, I was almost scared they weren‚Äôt going to use those iconic soundtracks from the earlier seasons, but they did it perfectly. Such a scary scene revealing the rumbling and eren as the founding attack titan in detail chef‚Äôs kiss"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Melle12345,Absolutely love the part where they all get drunk and just party. The really deserved some time to finally let loose.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_viixxx,"Amazing episode but I‚Äôm definitely reading the manga, I cannot wait a year to find out what happens."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZanorWoW,I might be a small minority but I‚Äôm totally okay with this. There‚Äôs so much content to dive into and they want to take their time. Plus these people have lives and need a break
ZanorWoW,midmidmidmidmidmid,I don‚Äôt think anyone has a problem with the amount of episodes. It‚Äôs only how it‚Äôs been disingenuously marketed
midmidmidmidmidmid,deokkent,"How is it disingenuous? Final season part 1 implies other parts, no?"
ZanorWoW,TheNewGuyGames,"properly finishing a story is a thousand times better than rushing it, even if it means extra time. Looking at you Game of Thrones and The100"
ZanorWoW,TheNobbs,The only problem is the name.
TheNobbs,ZanorWoW,They could call it ‚ÄúAttack on Titan: The Final Season - Hello Kitty Adventure‚Äù and I wouldn‚Äôt give a fuck
ZanorWoW,Obeselump,"exactly, plus i dont know what im going to obsess over when this is over so i want it to go as long as possible"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ruf1yo,"If I knew they going to finished this in 2023, I would have waited for the series to finished than binge watch everything. I binge watched till now thinking it was going to be the final episode."
Ruf1yo,SockkPuppett,"for real lol I was like ""aot heard that show was good about time I watch it"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,"2023??? tell us the month at least, plz."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ssann06,I wish the Marley flashback was a whole episode I love seeing everyone happy. I Loved seeing Sasha again and Levi before he was hurt
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cimricek,Erens character development is the best arc in anime. Try to change my mind
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AudaciousXII,"I honestly cannot believe how amazing this show is and how good the music is also. This episode is what I always wanted as well. It‚Äôs been a crazy ride and this season has split the fan base so much with the extremists views and has gotten to how life is today. Weirdly I always wanted Eren to do this, I was team Eren but not team jaegerist if that made sense. More so because even though Floch is so well written. I could not stand their mission when they had 300 of their men turned into titans and were alright with murdering Levi because he wanted revenge on the man who killed all the scouts.   

This world in my eyes was probably like 5-10 countries and were full alright with paradis being wiped out which is why Eren really had not many other options. He had 4 years left and only once chance to access the rumbling. Willy Tybur also convinced the whole world what eren was going to do prior to him attacking. What he did not count for is that the jaegerist were people carrying over the same hate that he wanted to end too and eldia would probably would split anyway and the cycle would still continue. I‚Äôm glad they showed those citizens from marley acting like devils because people have forgotten how awful Marley has been and what they created. Like they were flat out about to murder a kid because he stole a purse and his race. Eren saw there was no hope left and people will continue to lose their freedom because of their race and because of Marley.  

It was great to see the whole gang back together and something i have totally have missed the last 27 episodes. Eren was always like this but damn if mikasa did not choke there things probably could have changed. He totally said those words to her in season 4 because he was hurt and no clue why she really cares for him that much. But his view to Historia definitely brought up something I didn‚Äôt think before and how people are forced to eat their parents because of this world and the fact they are sentenced  for only 13 years to live. Like honestly it is so wrong but same time all the shit he says and how awful it is. Realistically paradis would fall and the people he loves would die by the time eren dies. Who else would really save eldia and not let Marley or rest of the world take over."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,snowmoreowls117,I lost it when they played the music from when Reiner and bertholts betrayal
snowmoreowls117,TheNewGuyGames,"Unless I'm thinking of a different part and missed the that song, it was not that music that played.  
  
The song that played as the titans came was …ôtÀà√¶k 0N tŒ¨…™tn, not YOUSEEBIGGIRL/T:T."
TheNewGuyGames,whitelotusaang,The name of the song is part 2- 2nd shingeki no kyojin
TheNewGuyGames,snowmoreowls117,Close enough
TheNewGuyGames,AcheloisMusic,"Side music question; during the dancing and drinking scene, the song playing sounds like a different style of an older AoT song, but I can't quite remember what song it is or from what scene it is.
It's the same melody/motif, just different style/instruments. Any thoughts?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,"damn. it really could've all gone so differently if only mikasa gave eren a different answer, huh?"
amazingaida26,Durge1764,"Hmm not sure, like he says to Zeke he‚Äôs only got 4 years left to live anyways"
amazingaida26,mertcanhekim,It wouldn't matter. Eren learned the answer from Zeke regardless
amazingaida26,9HashSlingingSlasher,Do you really think he‚Äôd make a different decision that affected billions of people depending on Mikasa‚Äôs answer?
amazingaida26,StatisticianAware588,"I think Mikasa believes if she told him she loved him, he would have used the time he has left on this earth to live happily with her instead of causing the rumbling...but Eren is doing this because he wants he to live a long, happy life so it wouldn't have made a difference imo.

Instead, I think if the person advocating for eldian safety didn't throw the islanders under the bus and everyone cheer, Eren would have considered an alternative to the Rumbling...but once again, even the eldians from Marley proved that they want to exterminate all the ""devils"" of the island. Thus, he starts his mission immediately afterwards, as they confirmed to him it's the only way to save Paradis."
amazingaida26,Mybitchmyhoemyhoemy,"I really don‚Äôt  get it. If she tells him she‚Äôs in love with him, he just changes his mind? What am I missing?"
amazingaida26,SillyLilHobbit,"Not really. My interpretation is that at that point Eren knew what he was gonna do, and just wanted to know whether Mikasa loved him or not before he embarked on his journey, because that would've been the last time they had a peaceful moment together."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tastydrummer,Yo this is just tragic. What a sad episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brittlovestrees,"I did a very loud ‚Äúgod damn it‚Äù as they showed the attack titan. I had a feeling the episode was ending riiiiight then. Such an amazing creature and I‚Äôm super excited to see him just go all out next year. Annoying that it‚Äôs a year but, I‚Äôm ready for some killer fight scenes in his new form."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kuhlayre,Watching the titans rising out of the water is one of my favourite scenes I've seen in any show. Full stop.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SlapChopMyShamWow,"Despite what your opinion is on the show not ending until next year, this was a hell of an episode to leave it on. I figured there was something more to Eren making all of his friends resent him and knowing he did it because he wants them all to be happy and not mourn him when he‚Äôs gone is fucking gut-wrenching. Zeke even told him flat out that Mikasa was in love with him and he still didn‚Äôt waver. His role as the protagonist is one of the most fascinating I‚Äôve ever seen because the line is so heavily blurred at this point but at the very least, we know he cares more about the people close to him than anything else on the planet and will take any measures to see them safe. 

Side note, seeing the whole group together again having a night of pure peace and happiness with those people in the camp made me indescribably happy even though I knew it was all gonna get ripped away right after"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,"This episode drove one thing home hard: diplomacy, logic, and kindness are simply no match for ingrained bigotry. I understand the people who say genocide is never the answer, but then I'm left to wonder... what is? Should Paradis and the Eldian people just be doomed to their fate? How many people is it okay to kill to achieve freedom for your people? Where do you draw that line, and who gets to decide? Systems of bigotry like this have never in history fallen without violence - look at slavery in America, we fought a fucking war to end it and honestly, I'd let all of those people die all over again if it meant ending that awful system of oppression."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amazingaida26,"the titans walking into liberio and destroying everyone and everything in their path was terrifying to watch, holy shit."
amazingaida26,Pardusco,Are we sure that's Liberio?
Pardusco,sundownsundays,"Considering the party with the refugees and Jean's flashback to those same refugees a few episodes ago when Hange mentions that Liberio is doomed, I'm guessing it is. But they don't really show where the refugee camp was exactly so who knows."
Pardusco,shaz12o9,its not
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tayeday,"Is Eren the father? Did he wanted to be with Mikasa??? 

Can't believe we gotta wait another year. Anyone know where the manga leaves off of."
tayeday,DarthDookieMan,"This episode ends right where Chapter 130‚Äôs ended as well. If you *really* can‚Äôt wait, the yet-to-be-adapted material is 131 and onwards til 139, the final chapter and its bonus pages."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSlumpDog,"People who have already read the manga and still watch the show, do you still enjoy it as much if you know what‚Äôs going to happen? I‚Äôm really thinking of reading the last few chapters"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,roki,"Great episode, especially the final minutes. Goosebumps all the way."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RoboticUnicornNose,Oh my god the flashback to seasons one had me broken I don‚Äôt even know what to feel anymore if wrens right or wrong holy shit
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OB-x-1,Episodes with Eren are always the best
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turtloblade,"Although I‚Äôm team Attack Titan on this conflict I thinks it was pretty sweet that the world was able to put aside their differences and gather up the global alliance to defend the continent shores. Also that ‚Äúit‚Äôs the ATACK TITAN‚Äù scene was sweeeeeeet!!!! I enjoyed all the art too, the absolute horror on the faces of the marleyan canon men were great. In the manga the global alliances war ships didn‚Äôt do shit against the colossals but we actually saw them to some damage which I appreciate. I liked Eren and co. visiting the refugees. Plus it‚Äôs cool to see different people from many cultures like the refugees who are clearly inspired by Turkish clothing, culture, food, drinks and etc. Overall good episode and top notch scenery. Enjoyed it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheRealWipper,"(Anime only here) So it's what I've been thinking for a bit but this basically confirms it. Eren must have feelings for Mikasa as she does for him as well. Although he isn't sure she cares for him in any other way than family and after she gave that answer it was some kind of click in his brain that there's nothing left? But then we see him after with Zeke possibly trying to convince himself or find some reason that she doesn't care in a way he wants her too, but then says he ""only has 4 years left anyways."" Again just seems like he's trying to act like he doesn't care at all or something to that point. Then everything with Historia and the different points of view from everyone he talked with to set this plan into motion was spectacular. He was playing so many different sides and we got see throughly see his thought process finally. Such a sad and brutal episode that makes me feel horrible for Eren and everyone else. He's going through so much pain, and was even before they went across the ocean. He now thinks this is the only possible way to save everyone and save the people of Paradis. And you feel his anger when they rise from the ocean and it's a complete parallel to the start of AOT when the people in the walls were attacked and now they are facing that same horror while Eren feels that exact same rage he did when watching his mother get eaten. Wow. If anyone has anything to add or clarify feel free to do so, I love finding deeper connections and analyzing this series a lot."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Beautiful-Chard-1152,I feel lied to and betrayed but still happy and ok with it üòÜüòÜ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dare_unusual,"didn't make me cry at all,
what am I to you mikasa."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Category-Square,"It feels like this episode was sponsored by Vimto during Ramadan , if you know you know"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheLovelyStatic,How does the new attack titan even moveü•≤
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JayQuillin,Eren doing all of this to make sure his friends can live a long and happy life is the most disturbingly fucked up but still kind of wholesome thing ever lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PoosySucker69,"Eren was crying before he had that conversation w Mikasa.
Was he crying because he already knew the answer or because he thought about thr fate of those refugees? A question i want answers to."
PoosySucker69,Mab390,"Is strongly implied that is about the fate of the refugees, that's why he says that nothing has happened ""Yet""."
PoosySucker69,ShaidarHaran2,Sympathized with the refugees but knew he'd have to trample them with the rest of the world to ensure his friends safety
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sponge56,marley acting all surprised and horrified what did they expect would happen if they tried to piss of Paradis fuck around and find out they should have mined their own business and left those people alone
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lowtan,I'm officially team Eren. He knows he's dying and wants to secure happiness for the only people he cares about. Relatable af. Rumble on.
Lowtan,bshafs,"I mean, there's no chance of any of them living a normal life after this. That's a big flaw with his plan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Savant_OW,"Think I'll just suck it up and read the manga, I can't be bothered waiting until next year"
Savant_OW,_moe1,Fr
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,magnaprawn,Thought I was watching the wrong episode at first and didn't realize it was a flashback with Sasha! It was good seeing her again and seeing everyone get drunk together. I wonder if Eren waited for the Mikasa rejection and then went and became a baby daddy to Historia. It's going to be a long year to wait.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vgkosmoes,"As much as I‚Äôve loved the episode I can‚Äôt help but to feel a little unsatisfied. I really do wish the episodes were longer than 20 minutes because having such a short run time make everything feel a little rushed. 

Sucks we have to wait till 2023 for more but atleast AOT hasn‚Äôt ended yet!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrConor212,Goddamnit. I miss Sasha.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jgasparino44,"Bruh the colossal swimming took me so out of the moment it was hilarious AF, completely not what I had imagined. The captains being burned to a crisp from the steam brought me back though god damn that was cool."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,No_Championship_5162,I started watching aot a couple months before s4 released. Since I‚Äôm new to it I‚Äôm actually happy there‚Äôs a 3rd part so I can be apart of the fandom before it dies out like most shows doüò≠
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wildturk3y,"Is there anyone out there that watched the anime, caved and read the manga, and regretted it? 

Because man, I don't think I can wait any longer but I'm so conflicted. I've really enjoyed watching the anime and its pace. It's a lot of fun to see all the reveals play out on the screen. But the fact they pushed this to another year has left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I'm probably about 60% sure I'm gonna cave and read the manga"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Panda117-,Seeing Eren's Founding Titan's face was fun.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,plscallmeRain,"It surprised me that Eren was this rational. I thought he was purely acting on hatred and resentment, but no. I guess he thinks he's Jesus. That just gives this coming conflict a whole other layer of sad, on top of the sad, on top of the sad...

I wanted a movie just to have an uninterrupted, high quality ending, but I'm ok with a Season 7 too."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JackBelvier,Was anyone else taken aback by the colossals‚Äô steam just melting the flesh off of everyone on board the ships? Absolutely brutal
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wheresmyredemption,"So if mikasa had not family-zoned eren things would have been differently?

 And yet again history lies in the hands of the butterfly of chaos. A few words under the moon , maybe a kiss and then maybe eren might have considered lowereing down his sociopathic tendencies and not have chosen a mass genocide as the best option against the race war from 2000 years ago."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,espectro11,"Everyone, we must protecc blushing Mikasa at all costs!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ViSimpp,Who was hoping for a movie ü§ö
ViSimpp,rynemac357,Yeah that would have made more sense ... now for 10 chapters are they again gonna make like 10 ep?
rynemac357,ThatFellaJohnny,I'm hoping they do a small amount of episodes. Pool the budget into them and make them look great. I think you would only need 8 episodes at most.
ViSimpp,TheNewGuyGames,"How many chapters do they typically go through to make an episode? If the story can be explained better and more time given to each episode, even if not a full season, then I'd much prefer that personally."
TheNewGuyGames,awdufresne,The number I've heard thrown around by manga readers is something like 1.5 chapters per episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cimricek,"God the Rumbling scene was perfect.
Using the same audio.
Oh what a show"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShaidarHaran2,"Some good, some odd  

I liked the first half showing some of their first reactions to life outside the wall, and the intrigue of why Eren chose this path. There were a couple of cuts that seemed weird, like it would flash back to someone's face then cut back in half a second, which seems like an editing issue rather than a choice, and it happened at least twice that I saw. And there was no end card or anything to announce part 3, I had to come here and see it? I'm watching officially on Funimation. That I felt took some of the punch out because I was sure there would be an end credits scene announcing it, and this was the ""last"" episode we knew of. But hanging Attack Titan Eren is terrifying. 



Part 3 rather than movie, ok cool. I just hope it has none of these animation issues and gets a pristine ending it deserves."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sunsetqueen,"I really enjoyed this episode! It was so good to see Sasha again with everyone. The titans heading to Marley is my favorite scene. The animation was beautiful, and the background music made everything perfect!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,romanNood1es,Mikasa putting Eren in the family-zone caused the Rumbling? üòÖ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bigbrownbanjo,God dammit what the fuck is next I‚Äôm so fucking confused and emotional
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kkycble,Why is Historia asking Eren about getting pregnant? I don‚Äôt understand the implications of Historia getting pregnant‚Ä¶ Can someone help this dumb dumb? Thanks in advance :)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"I feel like missing a leg would be enough to put Eren in the Liberio internment zone but bro goes and stabs his left eye out too, like was the missing eye really necessary?"
Twindo,AbaramaGolding,I think he had to hide his face
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Avocadomistress,"literally just leave this thread immediately, you will get spoiled. The manga readers are in here in full force"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DexQ,"That line from Eren ‚Äúyou are the wrost girl who saved me‚Äù hit Krista hard. Because that is what Krista said back in S3 part 1 when she freed Eren instead of eating him, which result to the largest genocide in the history, thus actualizing what she said about herself."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,midmidmidmidmidmid,"Anyone else think showing everyone‚Äôs time in Marley at the start of the season would have given so much more meaning to almost everything that happened this season? Sasha‚Äôs death, Eren‚Äôs decisions, EMA‚Äôs table scene, the Alliance‚Äôs motivation‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand the reasoning for placing it now instead of earlier."
midmidmidmidmidmid,TheNewGuyGames,"I think I prefer it this way. For example, I had imagined during S4 part 1, that Eren somehow got to Marley before everyone and forced their hands to come and fight/rescue him. A lot was left to mystery, not to mention the mystery behind Eren's motivations. That mystery, for the most part, is gone now and it was nicely explained in a flashback from two different peoples perspectives. Personally, I love the way that it was done, but understand it being offputting."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Best-Ability7293,"Anyone know what volume does this episode leave off on? I aint waiting another year, i waited a fucking decade."
Best-Ability7293,Habakinush,That was chapter 130 I believe.  So you would continue on chapter 131 to the end
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,InternalTripping,mikasa cockblocked the relationship entirely and ppl call eren and mikasa the best shipüòÇ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"Random Markeyan citizens: maybe we should hang this kid to make an example of him 

Eren (internally): maybe I should trample your continent"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zbearbear,"That last shot of the Rumbling coming out the ocean was so good! 

And so we wait another year. Ngl part of me was hoping we'd get a movie but not gonna complain about another season. 

But that means...I just wanna keep ""The Rumbling"" as the OP. It's just too good to followup."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BallsMcWanky,I‚Äôm going to need a name on the song that plays during the drinking scene
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,playfreeze,During the party scene I was imagining people like Reiner or Annie getting drunk and transforming into titans just for the hell of it and walking around as drunk titans lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cpt_Soaps,Historia got pregnant so she wouldn't be turned into a titan right? And who did she get pregnant with?
Cpt_Soaps,Jammyhero,the farmer
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rayk10k,"So that scene when eren and zeke were talking and it cuts to the scene where Sasha dies, is that eren seeing his future memory of Sasha‚Äôs death?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,A_Wild_Gorgon,Gotta feel bad about Eren obviously loving Mikasa but he's knows he's going to die in a few years anyways
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fazepatrickstar,"The colossal titans went Michael Phelps on em. Then smoked em out on that good kush, blazing the front guards"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,the4lchem1st,"This episode was insane. I loved the wholesomeness when the gang was all drinking and the flashbacks of Eren in Marley. The second part of this season has been so slow and monotonous at times but it was nice to see everything tying together and why Eren decided to go rogue. And the Mikasa and eren sceneüò≠ Girl just tell him you have feelings for him‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs painful watching everyone realize it except for her

I‚Äôve been anime only but I think I‚Äôm going to read the manga. The main reason is I keep getting semi-spoiled on every platform and I don‚Äôt want to live in fear anymore lol"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ColdSummer223,"This episode was litt! Loved seeing the titans and Eren achieve what he set out to do since the beginning of the series.

After this episode I am convinced that Eren Yaeger is the son of Itachi Uchiha. Except instead of destroying his clan he destroyed the world."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,The Paradis Olympic Swim Team has really improved this year.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CeddyWap,I was LOST IN THE SAUCE at the beginning I thought we were in an alt verse or something like that. But it was very nice that they took the last ep to show how Eren got to Marley in S4 and why. And a taste of how TERRIFYING the Rumbling really is. I genuinely have no clue how anyone‚Äôs gonna stop Eren at this point so 2023 can‚Äôt come fast enough
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kltbird182,"I'm so fucking mad. Just let it end. Stop making me wait and finish the damn show. I know I can read it, but I don't want to."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Coolmann2049,"The episode's last line..

It was pulled from when Eren was going 'berserker titan' while fighting Annie. Any speculations?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Minshow,"So the tech levels are intriguing, those battleships were like 1940's tech in our world. The mid east alliance was more advanced than Marley, but some other nation is even more advanced. Also makes it odd planes aren't really a thing yet, I would think flight technology would be a priority."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,clique34,Wow wtf. That was so intense. I literally had my jaw wide open at the last part.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rockpolitik,I JUST CAN'T WITH THE SOUNDTRACK AT THE END
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AmetDj,"I have literally bought myself the last two volumes of the manga the moment I saw ""2023"" on screen. No way I am waiting another 8/10 months to see the ending when we are this close..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Katzblazer,"I am in denial there is no way Eren is the  father of historias baby?? what are they implying??

if that's true omfg my respect for EREN just went down the sewer, gosh someone tell me this isn't true. what the actual \*\*\*\*?"
Katzblazer,lord5678,"Yeah he's not. The father is mentioned in part 1, just some farmer dude Historia hit up one day."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Phantombk201,This season was perfect. The best ever season of anything i've ever watched in my life (even if its not fully concluded)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,neekogasm,I have been annoyed that this whole time we have not gotten a concrete answer on why eren is doing what hes doing. But his conversation with historia revealed that he believes that he can stop the cycle of hatred by ending civilization itself. Also in the extended conversation with Zeke in Liberio he talks about wanting his friends to live a happy life. It also seems like hearing the chants during the forum in Liberio cemented his thoughts on the matter. I still believe that Eren should have at the very least tried to have peace talks before immediately resorting to the massacre in Marley. It seems in that moment he was fueled with a lot of resentment. I think in his head he may think he is doing the right thing but he is ultimately fueled by vengeance and hatred himself
neekogasm,Ok_Chicken1370,Did you not watch the episode? There weren't gonna be any peace talks. Even the Eldian rights advocacy group fully saw Paradis as an island of devils. That's why Eren left his friends after the speech at the forum. He learned how truly hopeless any attempt at peace would be.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wolfman_1998,So is Eren the father of Historia's baby or is that left up for interpretation?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Solua004,"A letdown it didn't finish this season ,but I'm still hyped for the finale in 2023! Also titans swimming is definitely something that never even crossed my mind especially the wall ones"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MasterSofa69,I'm very curious as to how the final opening will sound
MasterSofa69,H4mpuz,"I think it will be a much more emotional intro like ""Red Swan"" I seriously doubt it be anything like ""The Rumbling"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cimricek,Levi looking like Kenny in that suit
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarkAbsol27,That may end up being my favorite aot episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainSmeg,I can‚Äôt deal with waiting so long for the conclusion‚Ä¶not again‚Ä¶
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SnipeGhost,got the chills
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SnipeGhost,I‚Äôve watched this show 2 times and watched countless recaps and im still kinda confused
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Diomil,I think things would've been massively different if Mikasa was just honest with Eren and told him she loved him.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GrimWolf216,"Lookin forward to binging this second part starting tomorrow. First part was animated beautifully. 

Also really glad to hear that part three will continue to be episodic. Sucks it might be a year away, but if they continue this quality, I think I‚Äôll be pleased."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Michigan_Forged,Should have had those badass naval cannons on land. They fucked up
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JamalFromStaples,So far it‚Äôs beating out ‚ÄúHero‚Äù in IMDB. It was definitely up there.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dabbykid98,I started this anime when I was in 5th grade it will be done when I graduate
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pieckfingershitposts,Final season my ass
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheFalconKid,If we get confirmation the clown is killed then the rumbling was justified.
TheFalconKid,bnenbvt,This is the first pro-genocide AoT take I'm totally on board with
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hiraethum,That end 2 min or so when the titans came out of the sea was awesome. Eren was returning the terror suffered by Paradis as they were massacred 1000 fold with the wall of wall titans.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bruh412,Mikasa fumbled the bag
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NUKEHAZARDANGEL,Can someone explain the historia getting pregnant thing please? How would that help her or eren? Why do the MP even want her kids?
NUKEHAZARDANGEL,DannyTheVampire,"They would want her to continue the royal bloodline. In her blood is the fritz family which was necessary to control the founder. Since you‚Äôd need a person with royal blood to inherit a Titan, and then another person with the founder to then be able to use the founder‚Äôs power to its full extent without the vow renouncing war taking into effect. Granted none of this matters anymore since Zeke convinced Ymir to get rid of the vow. But now eren convinved Ymir to no longer listen to also only be commanded by those of royal blood."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nixlendt,Things do not added up. Why is the title called ‚ÄúThe Dawn of Humanity‚Äù? Humanity is going to be almost extinct after the rumbling.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,phineasxaver,"I know this discussion is for AOs, but can someone with manga knowledge share if the first half of this episode is the flashback that everyone was saying was missing from earlier in the season? Or is that part still absent from the anime?"
phineasxaver,DannyTheVampire,Kinda. The scenes with Eren and Mikasa talking and him asking her what he meant to her happen much earlier in manga.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,VeniceRapture,"What confuses me is why did everyone even believe for a second that Zeke's plan would work? They were debating that if their peace talks wouldn't work that they'd have to agree to Zeke's plan.

Let's say Zeke gets his way and makes all Eldians sterile. So what? Marley gonna invade anyway, kill most of them, and imprison the rest in a concentrstion camp. Marley was there for the natural resources, not because they could turn into titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GlitteringPidgeon,"this is honestly one of my favorite episodes. It really felt like everything that has happened so far across the series had come to this point. To see how they got here, it really reminded me of the essence of the story and the characters in it.  Eren, Mikasa, Armin, and all of the characters have come so far, and the world has expanded with it. The animation and music was amazing as well. I‚Äôm also glad that they are finishing part two like this, because now they get time to make the final final (lol) that much better."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uniquesmilex,It was nice seeing Sasha again üòï
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Small-Interview-2800,"Why‚Äôs everyone saying Mikasa rejected Eren or ‚Äúfamily-zoned‚Äù him? She just couldn‚Äôt put her feelings into words, she didn‚Äôt reject him. Both her and Eren knew and knows Mikasa loves him. Eren just wanted to hear from her mouth and also wanted to confirm if this is an Ackerman thing or her own feelings, hence him asking Zeke."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,illumantimess,"I didn‚Äôt read the manga and this is directed at anime onlies: but doesn‚Äôt it seem clear there is something more going on with Historia‚Äôs pregnancy? Particularly the way it‚Äôs left just hanging without explanation in this episode and things are rarely what they seem on the surface in the show. I‚Äôve had a theory that Historia would name her daughter after her friend Ymir and through some weird Titan time stuff that Ymir would end up becoming the founder Ymir (who even kind of looks like Historia, although that could just be the royal lineage connection). I don‚Äôt really believe it after the Ymir backstory episode which seemed to explain that aspect of the story well enough. I just feel like this pregnancy and baby factors into the end game somehow and it wasn‚Äôt just about preventing Historia from being turned into a Titan."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kelso186,"Historia, I knew you had a thing for Eren. üòè Don't let Mikasa find out who the father is!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aselleus,"I legit just finished catching up on AoT last night, not realizing that was the last episode of the season - I was thinking, ""Now I'm finally caught up for next week!"". Now I don't know what I'm going to do with myself ha."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FrozenFern,This show is just so amazing. The lesson about everyone being flawed. Eren hated Reiner & Bertolt for destroying the wall and now he's doing the same thing but 1000x the scale with all the colossal titans arriving while the soldiers watch in horror.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jarms48,"The lack of naval tactics is annoying. The ships should be moving, not holding stationary in a long line. They should be opening fire at ranges well over 10 kilometres as well. It‚Äôs completely possible with WW1 era technology. 

The same thing happened at the start of the season when Marley was at war with the allied powers. 

Still love the show, just wish the worlds navies were smarter. Lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Huenian,"Great episode. If Eren doesn't play the villain, who will? It goes against every fiber of his being but there is no other way. I only watch anime.* Can't wait for the end. Beautifully done."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xgdays,"Am i one of the few to agree with Eren? i hate that the rest are trying to stop him it makes no sense the entire world wants Paradi people dead, what your ancestors did is not your fault nor was it even Ymir‚Äôs fault. Also since she got her powers like that is it possible to find that place somehow and gain another founder titan? idk. Anyways this is the greatest anime to ever exist but honestly the ending is worrying me a lot, especially when they started killing their friends for the sake of saving the people that been torturing them for 100s of years."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,judgementjake,Theres no reason for a part 3 of a ‚Äúfinal season‚Äù. Shits ridiculous. Last chapters can easily be made into a 2 1/2 hour movie
judgementjake,myunfortunatelife,"I'd rather have another season than a movie but they should've just said season 4, 5 and 6 rather than split it into parts"
judgementjake,HereButQueer,"And thats less strain than a (roughly) 10 episode season. It obviously means less work, but that means they gotta be more careful what to include with this much content. I am sad that it isn't a movie though"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Transpatials,"The swimming colossals was the dumbest looking scene of the entire series for me.

The animation looked really weird, and the scale as well, I guess because of the perspective, but they looked tiny."
Transpatials,666JFC666,Yeah I figured they would either walk across the floor or they would just be kind of buoyantly floating through the water almost like doggy paddling
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LoudTension3,It‚Äôs still not appearing in funimation for me üò≠
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Huuzo,Why isn‚Äôt the episode up on Crunchyroll yet?
Huuzo,ThatRyanFellow,Clocks gone forward maybe? Putting it at 21:45pm GMT instead? Can‚Äôt think of any other reason
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maddogkaz,"Well Finally Eren is back, the show improves tenfold with him actually being in it. As for the episode itself it's just a  lot of flashbacks to explain stuff we never saw.

So I now have context for that random flashback Jean had and I still don't get the motivation of any of Hange's group. So they are betraying all their people and stopping the only thing protecting them from the world committing genocide on them because they had fun with some guy that one time...that's not enough for me to believe they would betray the island especially since if any of those people knew they were eldians they would have been spat on them and attacked them instead. 

That big meeting scene was random and I didn't really understand it since it came and went so fast. But the gist seems to be a bunch of people saying they should kill everyone on Paradis.

Historia was back finally after being a non character for all this time to the point I'm pretty sure people forgot she existed.

Lastly after all this build up the rumbling is finally happening and...it was super awkward. They really didn't make that look good did they?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrConor212,Just waiting here like SpongeBob for Funimation to upload it at 9:45 ‚è±üëÄ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daydreamer_she,"I thought the titans are so big, they‚Äôll walk through the ocean but they can swim! Wtf! Titans have swimming abilities?? Nice! They‚Äôre better than me i guess in this aspectüòí"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cimricek,Could be handled better. But maybe I am just salty about having to wait another year
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,enough0729,I wonder if I can watch ‚Äòthe real last episode‚Äô while I‚Äôm alive
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Grown_from_seed,"This episode‚Ä¶ although the tone of most of it was happy things happening to our scouts, their happiness was so somber. Like I‚Äôm just so sad that it‚Äôs come to this. 

Not gonna lie though, I‚Äôm surprised that I agreed with Eren this episode. Not his actions, I think the rumbling is wrong. But I agree with him, I want all his friends/scouts to have a long and happy life."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tyler980908,"Been so long since we saw eren being happy, knowing that he really care and loves his friends is so nice but bittersweet knowing what happens. Riveting final episode of this part, now a painful wait until 2023."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MikasaAckerman1996,This episode has been one of the best episodes ofthis season! Love how the squad drinking together.. Eren's motivations...Titans swimming in the oceans ...mind blowing!! üî•üî•
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarkSector93,Hold on a sec....Eren fuck@@@ Historya??? Poor Mikasa.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TRUFFELX,The wall Titans that were blown apart were probably pulling up like ‚ÄúHey guys sorry we‚Äôre late we got blown up and sent to the bottom of the ocean‚Äù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PatsFanWill,Why wasn't the start of this episode at the start of season 4?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zerocar,Am I the only one that thought this would be the last episode or am i stupid?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Psychological-Air205,"The funny thing about this is that the Marleyans did this to themselves, by constantly abusing the Eldians for their ability to kill them all they‚Äôve just sealed their fate by making them kill them all."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jinx_in,Finally eren got some screen time
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,filthyn00b,When did Eren join with the rest of the group? Last thing that happened was the shadis and marget sacrificing themselves  so I'm confused
filthyn00b,nmazza12,Flashback to when scouts infiltrated Marley before the declaration of war
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FunnyDifficulty6,Compared to manga they did an amazing job.glad they animated chapter 123 to show the plot. The final rumbling is here. See ya in part 3/movie!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EternalGuhan007,"I really wanted to see the opening and ending for the last time. Man those amazing callbacks to AOT theme and Call of Silence left me with tears. 
Also now we know Eren's perspective for why he decided to do this that's all I wanted to know.. AOT is a show that clearly doesn't establish good and bad sides but a clear perspective of why they're doing what they're doing. 

As the ending lyrics say "" Even if this is a mistake I don't doubt it. What is right is believing in myself strongly. """
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wheresmyredemption,So did Eren railed Historia or nah?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Arabian_Anchorman,"Seeing some similarities between Eren's new Attack Titan and Rod Reiss' titan, wonder why that is...

Edit: Also, they keep mentioning the 13 year life of titan shifters and I know it's because that's how long Ymir lived after obtaining powers but has anyone actually tried outliving the limit?"
Arabian_Anchorman,Donshio,I was wondering if the founder can outdo this curse
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LeoBocchi,"Honestly just wanna congratulate everyone on MAPPA for the final season, they just landed all the beats, the drama, the ost, the action, the characters, this was a phenomenal piece of television for the ages and honestly if they manage to stick the landing on part 3, Attack on Titan might just go the hall of fame of entertainment (I would like to say it already is, but if there‚Äôs one thing game of thrones and lost proved, is that the ending does make a difference)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,georgey215,this episode is insane. it goes from the entire og crew happy and smiling to the end of the world. & mappa is able to 180 your feelings just like that. broke my heart üíî
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,uniquesmilex,Is there anyway Eren can expand his lifespan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fanerv,"I realised how much I've needed this episode. I really love watching Scouts travel in Mare, and having a fun. Also I am elated to see more Eren's perspective."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LemonsRage,Ok next year it will end with a teaser for the ‚Äûfinal final final season‚Äú I call it‚Ä¶.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-Superk-,I'm going to titanfolk
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chilly_willy44,"Can someone explain to me how when the scouts visit marley for the first time how they knew what zekes plan was if that was before him and Eren even met on the island before and formed their plan? I am so freaking confused about this timeline.

  
It even shows when Eren leaves and then meets Zeke as a wounded soldier afterwards.... so how did the scouts know of zekes plan before that?  
Thank you for any help on this"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,blalokjpg,I first thought the beginning was a dream that Mikasa was having.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,godnorazi,Getting some Code Geass vibes..... Spoiler: Main protagonist becomes the ultimate villain to give everyone a common enemy so they stop fighting each other.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WildEyss,So what exactly does everyone think the relationship between Mikasa and Eren?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The_Meach,"To Eternity:  I AM THE SADDEST THING YOU WILL EVER SEE!!!!!!

Final Season of AOT:  Hold my beer."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PokemonTrainerSerena,How are these three parts considered one season? It will be released from 2020-2023. This is so dumb
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlazedAndConfused,"A few questions...

1. Why didnt Armin use the collosal titan ability at any point to try and either fight Eren or catch up to him in S4 Parts 2? He was the only one would could have turned to do something but didnt at all after the bombing of the bay incident.
2. What happened to Zeke? Hes shown as chained essentially in Ymir's ethereal plane, but did Eren eat him officially? Is he dead?
3. When will it explain where pure titans originated from? I'm assuming either at some point in the last 2,000 years someone had a bad idea to try and make new titans from a shifters blood and it being mindless/eats humans is a painful consequence to their arrogance, OR, the spinal fluid thing was already known and the only reason they are mindless/eat humans is because there isn't / wasn't a founding titan to verbally control them. Left unchecked by a founder, they default to mindless / human eating in hopes to find a shifter or the founder as an insurance policy the curse continues."
BlazedAndConfused,futuremo,"To your first point - The collosal titan isn't very fast in the first place, but even if he caught up it would have been Armin vs an Army of Colossals + Eren, probably not the best idea. Plus he had no clue where Eren was at the time, and rn they still don't know where he is. Also he was trying to manage the immediate fallout right after the rumbling started.

To the second question, We haven't been told what exactly happened to Zeke yet"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,robby8892,"I think narratively this was a horrible season finale as we gain no new information and are mostly left wanting.

The writers also commit to doing maybe the worst example of showing after telling I've ever seen put to tv.

And I truly believe episode 86 is the appropriate finale as it has a wonderful natural conclusion to the season.

Our characters are struggling and they are trying to build unity as a rag tag group that were initially enemies at the start of the season. 

Some are dead and there is an internal struggle to kill Eren to save the world. This was a true way to give us motivation for Part 3 as we already accepted that they are far to late to stop the initial destruction of the rumbling.

We ""killed"" Flock and got the goal set to refuel the air craft and catch up to Eren and his army of Olympic level titan swimmers. (I don't know anywhere that they established that Titans could breathe under water and I can admit I might need more context. It just looked silly) 

The stage is set.......

Point 1

Episode 87: Season Finale - Filler 

Episode 87 is 50% a filler episode in my eyes even if it gives a happy time with the gang it tonally doesn't fit with how we left everyone in the previous episode at such dire straits.

I get fan service, but the show needs to commit to this acceptance of the immoral genocider they created in Eren and stop trying to use characters like Armin and Mikasa to be his staunch defenders to pull him back or justify his cause.

It's not a cute fun loving show. Eren is going to commit global genocide to keep some of his friends alive which seems to make little sense.

Why would he think they wouldn't try to stop him? Flock was going to kill them all, would it not have been prudent to maybe say ""Keep my friends alive"" to Flock the trigger happy loose cannon....

Point 2

The writers want to have their cake and eat it.

The Episode commits to doing something I always known I would hate. They show us scenes of Eren doing things we were already told about in this season and the prior season.

So much so that it almost feels like a waste of time (Filler) as no new information is shared with us in the major plot. We already know Eren has committed to the path and we already know it's for the small reason to save his friends.

Now this would of been a perfect moment to address Sashas death....Seeing how the writers don't care to show us how he feels about her death I'll just assume it'll take up half an episode in Part 3 and not bother...

R.I.P. Sasha...

Point 3 

The writers aren't confident....

I'm 100% sure there is more lore and things to do from the Manga, but it doesn't seem to flowing as well as it could.

I very much feel confident in their decisions to make the character the protagonist they created a genocidal maniac as after a rewatch of the show up to now you can see how he slowly goes further into madness and blood lust over the years.

Truly a bold move and I wish it felt like writers were more confident in this choice. Because for most of the episode we try to play with idea that Eren could have always been like this.

A monster who is lost in his desire for revenge. No longer possible to reach his is a single minded killing machine....

Oh wait no in the previous scene it's so his friends can live happy lives. He has a good heart even though he will genocide the world.

Ultimately I feel like they can't decide what kind of monster Eren is. Is he the revenge machine pushed to the brink.

Or is he a person who would kill the world to save the people he loves. 

Guess we'll know which one fits next year!

Note:

This is very ranty and I respect any disagreement. 

If you wanna discuss I'd be happy to oblige, if you want to argue I'll probably ignore you.

I don't think the show is bad, but I find it's becoming frustrating when the writers can't commit to their decisions.

And I only wrote this because of how shitty I feel we ended the season as opposed to the last season.

Episode 86 is the true Finale. Fom a narrative perspective it's perfectly done.

Annie is broken, and we know the path forward is to save what little bit of humanity is left.

Yet she is done and wants to stop the fighting.

And what would be a perfect ending scene but having Eren making his first attack with the rumbling.

-Pointless Rant"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,youreqt,God i hate gabi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,amonhensul,"This is ridiculous. I expected that Mappa wouldn't be able to finish this anime after announcing they're releasing only 12 episodes, but for fucks sake, *really*? They could have made it clear that part 2 isn't over at the very beginning. Overall, kinda weird of them to divide season 4 for more than two parts. I would be better to wait longer for the full part 2 with the ending instead of getting an unfinished ending right in the middle of the last arc."
amonhensul,InternalTripping,"they did make it clear, so did the millions of people that read the manga. it was announced about a month ago that attack on titan p2 would end on 130, which leaves 9 more chapters to be animated. they‚Äôre doing this because it‚Äôs gonna be a shitshow to be animated even with 3 years of extra time"
amonhensul,owlpacino57,You know production committee announced AOT final season in 2019 and Mappa picked AOT in 2020.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,owoah323,So‚Ä¶ did Historia ask Eren to be her baby daddy?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Twindo,"When step sis won‚Äôt let you smash

Commit Genocide"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shroffinator,"Okay okay so did eren get historia knocked up??

I don‚Äôt get that scene."
Shroffinator,Jammyhero,"he didn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre just seeing the point in time where she agreed to get married and have a child with the farmer to avoid being turned into a titan."
Jammyhero,maddogkaz,There's no evidence of any of that...it looked like she asked Eren for a baby.
Jammyhero,susanookuruma,How would that prevent her from being turned into a titan? Eren said to her that the MP want her to bear children as sacrifices for the island.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MonsterStunter,"Right I'm reading the manga, Mappa are taking the fucking piss if they think people will wait 18 months for 8 episodes. What a joke this whole bait and switch season has been. Yesterday's episode would have been amazing if it wasn't just a cliffhanger to draw fans back in."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FelixTyke,so..... did eren bang historia?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,susanookuruma,"HELL NAH DO NOT TELL ME EREN GOT HISTORIA PREGNANT

And they should've used the Rumbling soundtrack from the opening during the destruction of Marley at the end!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,manervaavrenam,"Lmao yeah I‚Äôm watching a summary of the ending on YouTube. I keep seeing manga readers say it‚Äôs ass so why even wait another year.

Edit: Just finished it. What the fuck"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CMDR_Fritz_Adelman,"I still don't understand why Eren considered Historia as ""worst girl in the world"". Given her abilities, bloodline, she has done everything through the story to help her friends and her people. Does it has anything to do with... her child?"
CMDR_Fritz_Adelman,LilEscobarz,"Historia being the ‚Äúworst girl in the world‚Äù is a callback to the Reiss cave where she was supposed to eat Eren. However by refusing to eat Eren and retake the founder, she was ready to doom rest of humanity, if it meant that she could save her friend. 

Right now what Eren is doing is the exact same. Dooming the rest of humanity so that he can save his friends, including Historia. That‚Äôs why he says she can do it, because she‚Äôs already done it before."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hyjori,I loved hearing the OST when the colossals swam to shore. I think that‚Äôs the first time they used one of the songs from WIT‚Äôs previous seasons it brought tears to my eyes.

Cimricek,chompske,"Agreed, I don‚Äôt think the flashback stuff was bad, but given it was the season finale, I‚Äôd much rather see stuff taking place in the present. We hardly got to see Eren this entire season :/"
chompske,myunfortunatelife,"Yeah, i loved the flashbacks because I think they were a necessary addition but imo they should've done them before. Not in the finale."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shibafrien,"I‚Äôm kinda mad about this episode just being a flashback. I wanted more story progression (which I know this technically was) but I want more of the rumbling like the last few minutes.

I‚Äôm also very weirded out by Eren and Mikasa‚Äôs relationship because I see them as siblings‚Ä¶ is that just me? 

Anyway, might read the manga because I‚Äôve already been spoiled so many times and I don‚Äôt want to wait a year."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hello-there-yes-you,"Why can‚Äôt they just use the translation from the manga? 
There is so much stupid lines in the episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SuperSatanGod,That final flashback to Eren's mom getting eaten begs the question if Eren really cared about his friends or if this is just some psychological tick getting satisfied.
SuperSatanGod,Donshio,Maybe both ?
Donshio,SuperSatanGod,"nah, the emphasis on the memory, coupled with erens Dialoge in the scene with vocal inflections say it all (brilliant vo by the actor). eren is engaging the same part of himself back when held by the entire corps saying ""kill em all"" after his first transformation. his desire for revenge overwhelmed his desire to protect his friend. IMO hes lying to himself to justify such a act because its a massive hypocrisy over why he was mad in the first place. 

  if anything isayama's story paints a wonderful cautionary tale about a sympathetic hero falling prey to his psychosis and goes school shooter."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nervious_Nerve,"The pacing since The Rumbling started was off. I've only watched Attack On Titan on marathon format (I've never liked waiting a week for one episode; it always leaves a sour taste in my mouth). But i was too excited for this season as to wait, so I could be wrong. There's just been too much slow-show-don't-tell conversations with minimal action payoff. I'll have to watch Season 4 Part 2 completely again in one sitting as to validate my opinion on my complaint. ""The Dawn Of Humanity"" was a very poor episode. Even worse as a season finale. I even think it might have been better right after Eren Starts The Rumbling. You get a flashback, exposition about the last time they saw Eren. Then in episode 27, Mikasa on top of the ship heading towards Eren, Reminisces about what she could have said differently. Idk, this was too anticlimactic. The dramatic sequencing of three events: Historia (when was that conversation by the way? I'm genuinely confused), Floch, Zeke and cutting off his leg was emotionally charged, I liked it. It was a bit too on the nose for Eren but I liked it. I am happy though they're making part 3, I wasn't very interested in a movie seeing as it's just rushed content fitted into a 1hr 20 minute movie (anime movies are never long) attack on titan is better on longer run times and big payoffs. I hope the next season is better handled in terms of pacing issues. Seeing as part 2 was honestly the best attack on titan has ever been up to the rumbling. God the emotions behind those episodes is coma inducing. Followed by the slowest-rushed? Arc of the anime's entire lifespan. What the heck, i saw the first season when i was 13, I'm 21 now, i can wait another year."

Every scene where the 104th are happy and smiling is an instant A+ Scene for me.

The second half of the episode was just... insane, is all I can say. Especially towards the end. Even when no words were spoken, you can just *feel* the despair and terror on each of the soldiers gathered there. I felt chills all over me. God, Part 3 can't come out soon enough."

With the slightly enhanced founding titan power he is able to see his fathers memories, which is also his own future memories that he chose to send back to himself."
IzziTheEpic,thatguybane,">after touching Zeke

To be more specific it's only after obtaining the power of the Founder Ymir which he got after hugging her in PATHS and giving her a choice to serve Zeke or help him. This obviously only occurred after he touched Zeke in the first place but touching Zeke alone isn't what allowed him to send memories through time."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vfhd,Another final season lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xahhfink6,"So... I just binged the whole anime series after being away from it for a long time (I started with the manga, switched to the anime when it came out. After s1 was so good I dropped reading but forgot to come back to the anime til now).

But something's really been bothering me as a plot hole, and that's the ability for one person to take on multiple Titan powers at once. If that's possible, then how come neither Annie, Berholdt, nor Reiner ever just chomped down on Eren and took the founder power that way? They repeatedly failed to capture him alive but each one of them had him in their mouth at some point so it makes no sense not to just take his power. 

It's also confusing that it had never happened before in history. If 500 years ago the armor titan ate the cart titan, then those two would always be together since the next person to eat that titan would get both, right?

On this same subject... What the hell happened to the Attack titan? It seems to be implied in this season that Grisha ate the founder and passed on both Attack and Founder to Eren, but in Eren's flashback his father was still alive and Eren just ate the Reiss girl, right? Maybe we'll see more about this in the future but it seems really weird that we don't know at all where the attack titan is or what it can do, especially since Grisha shouldn't be alive any more (assuming the 13 years thing is set in stone). Who has that power now?!?

No future manga spoilers please but any clarification would be appreciated (or even just say it was answered/gets answered in the manga)"
xahhfink6,IzziTheEpic,"Wow you are really lost. Eren ate his father and obtained the founder and attack titan at the same time. Erens father was given the attack titan by Eren Kruger in Marley.
So time line wise it goes like this - 
-Grisha takes attack titan from Kruger
-Grisha goes to Paradise and has a son, names him after Kruger
-Grisha finds the Reiss family hide out but decides to wait and spend time with his new family.
-The colossal titan and armored titan attacks, making Grisha kill the royal family and eat Frida, taking the founding titan so Marley can‚Äôt obtain it.
-Grisha steals titan fluid from Rod and injects it into his son Eren and feeds himself to Eren.
-Eren now has attack and founder titan"
IzziTheEpic,Crafty-Bunch-2675,"I think what he was asking was. Why didn't Annie just swallow Eren the time she captured him ?

Wouldn't she also have acquires Eren's powers if she did that ?"
IzziTheEpic,xahhfink6,"Okay just went back and found the scenes which lead to the conclusion... When they originally showed him eating someone to get his power he ate Frida while his dad watched, but somehow when he got more memories of it, it was just him and his dad there and his dad just died off screen. Really weird for that to be a 'blink and you miss it' kind of scene but that makes sense now even if it feels like a retcon.

It's still a massive plot hole that titans are able to acquire two Titan powers at the same time."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ill_Classroom4060,DUDE
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeadZeus007,"This episode was very confusing, the fast pacing at the end before the rumbling scene was jus too fast.

I always thought Historia was somehow on Eren's side and her getting pregnant was part of the plan. But apparantly History got Pregnant because she didn't want to be on Eren's side?

Also, Historia made a good point about he's going to do to everyone what happened to his mom too... Eren's counterpoint made no sense to me...

Also, Eren's plan continues without Historia, so why did he need her anyway?

How did ""the scouts"" get a seat in that congressional hearing where Eren decided to leave and start his plan?"
DeadZeus007,thatguybane,">But apparantly History got Pregnant because she didn't want to be on Eren's side?

No she got pregnant to help his plan after he brought up her line about being the worst girl in the world (from the cave scene at the end of season 3 part 1).

> Eren's counterpoint made no sense to me...

That's good because Erens plan is very extremist.

>Also, Historia made a good point about he's going to do to everyone what happened to his mom too... Eren's counterpoint made no sense to me...

Eren did need Historia. Specifically he needed her to not become a pawn of the MPs. The MP wanted to feed Zeke to her because they didn't trust Zeke. Eren didn't want that because he doesn't want any of his friends being forced to become titans and he especially doesn't want Historia to be sacrificed for the island. He went to speak to her to try to ensure that she wouldn't become a tool of the Maps since that could mess up his plan. Her becoming pregnant is what bought time for Eren Zeke and Yelena to set the stage for ""their"" plan.

>How did ""the scouts"" get a seat in that congressional hearing where Eren decided to leave and start his plan?

The Azumabito have connections and have been helping the scouts this whole time. Presumably they could get them into a conference like that if they were able to sneak them into Marley in the first place"
thatguybane,DeadZeus007,"But then why did he even confess to the MP's that touching a Royal with Titan power gives him more abilities?

And then why did Hange ask Eren why he's suddenly OK with sacrificing Historia when he was in jail earlier in S4? He never wanted to sacrifice her so i dno why Hange would ask that."

Is this from him inheriting his dads memories (and possibly his future inheritor) or is it from 2 conflicting personalities- attack titan and founding titan with vow renouncing war?
justarandommuffin,Ancient_Catch_5673,"You're thinking too deep. Eren is spaced out because he's at the place that brought his people so much suffering whilst knowing that he is going to annihilate everyone because of his future memories.

Winged_Hussar43,dailydefence,"I wasn't around there, I'm curious what were the general theories being floated around?"
ValooEldin,Mast3rBait3rPro,Apparently there‚Äôs hundreds of reviews giving it like a 1/10 from Saudi Arabia
alcridio,20gallonsCumGuzzler,"It's a joke, that didn't really happen.

What did happen though, is Eren became the Devil of Paradis Titan and got trapped on Mars. Oh shoot, I probably should have put a spoiler warning"
Abhinav6singg,ParticularOccupied34,No one's even seen it properly yet who aren't Japanese. The official subs don't launch for several hours.
ParticularOccupied34,UnyunMunyun,Its out now
ParticularOccupied34,fisch-boi,"you can watch it, but it won't be subbed. I watched it just to see the ending in a vague hope that it would end differently."
Abhinav6singg,suppadelicious,I guess that means they adapted the ending of the manga then.
suppadelicious,Ah_Un,FUCKIN WOOOORD DOG LMAO
suppadelicious,twisthisdick96,Why wouldn't they? The whole AOE was 100% cope in every way imaginable
twisthisdick96,Wonderful_Tomato_992,"Oh definitely, but the manga ending is shit lol"
suppadelicious,TheScrawlsOnTheWalls,I DON‚ÄôT WANT THAT!
suppadelicious,TFYBneed_therapy,That's not the reason but ok
TFYBneed_therapy,suppadelicious,A reason to receive bad reviews? Why not?
suppadelicious,Remy-Kun,The ending is the manga ending so maybe that‚Äôs why
Remy-Kun,suppadelicious,That explains the poor reviews then
Abhinav6singg,SunnyArcad3,"Considering the subbed version hasn't even released yet, it goes without saying that its just review bombers, the same thing was done with the previous episode, as well as **every single aot episode rated 9.9 or higher on imdb**"
Abhinav6singg,RAiD_-,Where do I watch man I can't find it. High seas I mean btw
RAiD_-,skippyalpha,It's not out yet in English
RAiD_-,iwearshoes21,I just dmed you a link to watch it
Abhinav6singg,Imperium_Dragon,"People really, really hated the manga ending"
Imperium_Dragon,spyder616,Well.... they ain't wrong.
spyder616,CoolJoshido,W
spyder616,Abhinav6singg,It's not that bad but
Imperium_Dragon,iwearshoes21,Understandable
Imperium_Dragon,pedr09m,well it was so shit it makes sense
Abhinav6singg,Condemnedthroat,One piece fans review bombing it
Condemnedthroat,Vegan_Digital_Artist,"As a OP fan, I have to say OP fans doing this shit is dumb and they need lives. It's so weird that it's a weird concept you can like *multiple* big Shonen titles and NOT hate any of them. People are weird."
Vegan_Digital_Artist,shaafu_8,"Same here. One piece is one of my favorite anime but I love a lot of other anime too including AOT. 
I believe these two anime are totally different in genre and shouldn't be compared."
Condemnedthroat,winql,They‚Äôre doing it because AOT fans review bombed Op episodes lmao
winql,Condemnedthroat,"If I recall correctly that was in retaliation to OP fans review bombing aot first wasn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre fans of a story condemning this cycle, they won‚Äôt ever learn ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Condemnedthroat,lordlossxp,Seriously? The fuck? I love both. Why cant other people love both???? Thats like review bombing spiderman 2 because you want god of war to look better. Some people are just dumb goddamn losers.....
Condemnedthroat,lunatic_paranoia,How do you know that?
lunatic_paranoia,Zevallos9,Some mfs in their community were tweeting about giving the last epi a 2 star review
Condemnedthroat,Vacation_Jonathan,This episode is genuinely bad
Vacation_Jonathan,Condemnedthroat,Okay. Expand on that.
Condemnedthroat,Rogue6104,Y‚Äôall mad that AOT is no longer peak and downvote our episodes
Rogue6104,Obsidan_TNT,it was one mf that made hundreds of accounts bro
Rogue6104,Zevallos9,Fuck up boy
Condemnedthroat,Obsidan_TNT,"it‚Äôs not OP, it‚Äôs DBZ fans"
Obsidan_TNT,WitekSan,As if they care lol. Go on any DB sub and look how they fight over super and the new one.
Abhinav6singg,YoYoWithJosh,"Considering how many people hated the manga ending, this isn‚Äôt surprising. 

Personally, I enjoyed it, but everyone should just watch and make their own opinions"
Abhinav6singg,pizzalover89,watch it yourself and make a conclusion
Abhinav6singg,DieBlaueOrange,"What? 6.2 is a totally fair rating if you've watched it. Even when the manga ended, it was similarly polarising."
DieBlaueOrange,bbbryce987,"When you look at the review breakdown though it‚Äôs 99% all 1 star 2 star and 10 star reviews, no one is actually rating it 5/6/7"
bbbryce987,Abhinav6singg,Exactly
bbbryce987,C-204,Yes because its either sycophants incapable of criticism or people who are distraught by the fact the manga was barely improved upon. There is no middle ground currently.
bbbryce987,AmirHKhan,its clearly not a 10 nor a 1 it should be like a 5. Mindless fans upvote it 10/10 before its out so its not wrong for other fans to vote it 1
DieBlaueOrange,YoYoStockWinner,Animation was 10 but story was 1‚Ä¶average is a 6 lol
YoYoStockWinner,Cole-y-wolly,"Uhm actually the average is 5.5.

Lol"
DieBlaueOrange,GuardianGuts,‚ÄúTotally fair rating‚Äù = ‚ÄúI read the manga and hate the ending therefore the episode is equally bad.‚Äù
GuardianGuts,Dyegreenluke,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E3jKMXkWQAM3Hfd.jpg:large
GuardianGuts,Kaigamer,"lad, 6.2 is above average on a scale of 1-10."
GuardianGuts,tiredparakeet,"If it's the same thing, then what difference does it make?"
GuardianGuts,CoolJoshido,yes.
DieBlaueOrange,Abhinav6singg,No way atleast it  could be between 7 to 8.5 .
Abhinav6singg,syamborghini,You got downvoted but it‚Äôs currently at an 8.6 üòÇ
Abhinav6singg,Additional_Road_9031,One piece fans and those who did not like the ending
Abhinav6singg,The-Mandalorian,"People didn‚Äôt like it.

Finale‚Äôs aren‚Äôt always easy to pull off."
The-Mandalorian,TFYBneed_therapy,That's not the case here it was review bombed by OP fans just like the rest of the aot episodes they review bombed
TFYBneed_therapy,Stehr93,"No, the Finale is really bad. Maybe the worst anime Finale i have ever seen..."
TFYBneed_therapy,Caffoy,"Not true, there are people who genuinely did not like this ending. Did it get reviewbombed by OP fans? Most likely, but that doesn't take away the actual reviews of fans who genuinely did not like it either."
TFYBneed_therapy,The-Mandalorian,People don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs not that complicated. Not everything‚Äôs a conspiracy.
TFYBneed_therapy,throwaway77993344,This is correct and the people downvoting you are morons. It's obvious if you look at how the rating has developed since this post (which btw. got made before the episode released).
TFYBneed_therapy,Consistent_Address_3,People tend to hate an ending when a major plot point is explained by teehee I‚Äôm stupid that‚Äôs why I killed 80% of the world and the protagonist gets retconned to make the alliance win
The-Mandalorian,Negative_Crab24,"Lol..literally half of the reviews were 10. How can u survive living in a bubble? Its OK to dislike the ending because you don't agree with eren , or mikasa...or whatever.... but doesn't mean it's a bad ending. Its like going to a married couple and saying your life is objectively shit because I don't like your partner. Like ..ok it's your right to dislike them but that doesn't mean my life is bad or that they are a bad person. 

I agree with Eren, I'm sad that he died, in my soul I feel like Mikasa and Armin were wrong and they betrayed and made the biggest mistakes of their life.... so I didn't get the ending that I wanted but I still think it was a perfect ending."
Negative_Crab24,Jamzhaha,Bro the ending makes no sense
Negative_Crab24,The-Mandalorian,Nice try. You‚Äôve convinced nobody.
The-Mandalorian,mikassweeps,"it's interesting how when people present you with facts and evidence you still continue to whine claiming it's not by OP fans while everyone knows it by op fans. the world doesn't revolve around you crazy right? at this point, you are not only trolling but coping as well. cope somewhere else where you don't have to spread misinformation."
Abhinav6singg,ibettercomeon,Because manga readers who hated the ending have been waiting THE LONGEST TIME for this
Abhinav6singg,IlonggoProgrammer,It‚Äôs just salty manga readers who are mad that all of us anime watchers loved it lol
IlonggoProgrammer,Abhinav6singg,Yeha I loved as well
Abhinav6singg,spyder616,I bet some of those people were manga readers that didn't like the ending like me lol
Abhinav6singg,GymLeaderIono,"For those that love the ending, surely you can understand why many people don't like it, right? The story is challenging and deviates from the usual kind of narratives that most mainstream viewers are used to. I'm not saying you are wrong for loving it, I'm just saying it's also not that shocking that some people don't like it.

I'm personally in the camp that hated the overall story. It's not just Eren turning bad, I just wasn't a fan of how the plot was handled in the back half. And that's fine. I personally wouldn't review bomb it, though, as I think purely from a technical standpoint it was masterful. I just really did not like the writing. To each his/her own of of course! But I still don't think the the negative reaction is shocking either."
GymLeaderIono,SpaceHairLady,"I feel like the ending did a lot that I expected in a better way than I imagined. War is complex, freedom is socially constructed, and life goes on."

Abhinav6singg,lifeasketch,"When the author apologizes for the ending it usually means something, at the very least it‚Äôs gonna split the fandom in half.

SaharshMe109,KisukesBankai,"How much? Didn't read manga but read it on the differences, seems the main thing was the same just added some context."
SaharshMe109,lifeasketch,"You even used all caps lock! I'm elated! Thank you for proving my point... 

The only thing positive out of all this is that by the end manga readers expected a 9 and got a steamy 5, anime watchers expected a solid 5 and got a 7 (thanks in part to the acting of the voice actors, and the shift in tone of Eren and Armin convo)"
Abhinav6singg,demon969,"this is why I don't give a cunting fuck about viewer reviews. firstly, because you get fuckheads review bombing shit they don't like but have never watched. secondly, because I don't let other people dictate to me what I should or shouldn't watch. If I go to watch something I'm not going to look at the opinions of what is usually a bunch of clowns who have reviewed something. I'm going to watch a trailer if it's something unfamiliar, or not if it's familiar and I've seen previous seasons/movies etc."

Abhinav6singg,Hange11037,Review bombing from other fanbases and still butthurt manga readers. They deny it but it‚Äôs plainly obvious when you look at any anime only discussions and the vast majority is overwhelmingly positive or at least neutral.
Abhinav6singg,Abhinav6singg,Guys I have watched the last episode. And that's f*&cking perfect and makes sense . Idk about manga but this episode was a pure masterpiece. And now I also understand why many hate this . Their brain is not developed enough to understand this . That's it . Don't listen to them . It's perfect objectively make your own decision after watching
Abhinav6singg,Loois_Angel,It‚Äôs not a matter of understanding the ending. Some people just have different taste. I personally give it a 6/10 as well.

CampoVlong,CamomilleGirl,review bombing ? you mean there are people out there who loved the episode but pretended it sucked ?

Abhinav6singg,fisch-boi,"Because some of us expected Eren to win and we're pissed about it. I'm not even joking when I say this, Isayama literally let a sexual fetish get in the way of an ending that leaves fans happy, AKA, he has a cuckold fetish and admitted that he let it interfere with the ending, infact, thats why you see Jean in the ending. We were rooting for him. But then the Manga ended just the same and it had us heartbroken. Eren Yeager, a character that I had been rooting for since I was eleven years old died in a wholly uncharacteristic way. The ending was completely botched and I gave up on the series. Then I saw Season 4 release and started paying attention, if only to see the Anime Onlies rage just as I had. Then it got split up and I slowly backed out until I saw Satal and the rest of the crew. they all got me to hope that Yama was a genius and that the anime would end differently just as MuvLuv did. And then Cour 2 happened and I was pissed. He knew the reaction to the ending was bad, but went through with it anyway? It makes no sense to me, so much so that I can only chalk it up to Japanese Stubbornness. 

Cour 2 was action packed and absolutely phenomenal save those final twenty minutes. If they had ended the story at the Fall of the Walls then I feel that it would've been the best spot to end it. Maybe come back with a What If? side story with the Alliance banding together to stop the Rumbling but otherwise? The Fall of the wall leaves a perfect ending for both sides of the Aisle."
fisch-boi,Pandasinmybasement,Bro if it ended with Eren announcing he is going to destroy the world and the series just ended...that would be way worse than the original ending lmao

ending is really dumb(not mappa's fault). animation was great but story was yuck after the 5 year jump.

While I don't agree with everything he said, I genuinely hate the ending. I'm not opposed to Eren being the bad guy, but I didn't like the way the plot was handled at all. But I guess it's just a difference of opinions.

But at least objectively speaking, you can kind of see why many wouldn't like it right? Like, I'm not saying the quality is objective. I just mean the story is challenging and deviates from the usual types of narratives most viewers are used to. So of course there are gonna people that don't like it. But it's also why some people loved it.  


EDIT: lol people downvoting me because I gave a reasoned response. Absolute crybabies."
The_Legendary_Shrimp,gammalabsgamer,I watched it from beginning to end 3 times a formed the opinion that the alliance sucks and Eren sucks. The only character to actually think things through and stay consistent was Floch.
prsfx1,SunnyArcad3,"Yeah you're completely right, lets just kill even more of the cast so the rest can be left in even more misery, real smart with that one weren't youüíÄ

People be pulling the ""plot armour"" card as if Eren is meant to kill the people he's doing the rumbling for (not necessarily doing it for reiner, gabi & falco ik, but they're all in the alliance fighting together w his friends)"
SunnyArcad3,Caffoy,"Well ya see, this could have been avoided if Isayama didn't write himself in the corner."
SunnyArcad3,gammalabsgamer,Him doing the rumbling for his friends and not for his homeland is the issue I have. I stand with Paradis and I'd trample every single one of them without hesitation. They had the choice to sit back and relax but decided to get in the way. At that point it's not even killing them they killed themselves by getting in the way.
prsfx1,Background_Ant7129,I 100% agree. AoT is my favorite anime of all time and the plot armor started showing even in Season 3 but it didnt ruin the story for me. Season 4 has crazy plot armor. The Jaegerists couldn‚Äôt even kill a single main character. Terrible.
prsfx1,prsfx1,"downvote more cuz u can't handle the truth. Aot sucked in the end. literally like got ending. insane animation but shittiest ending by isayama who started with a great plot but got lost in the ending.

fkin idiots."
prsfx1,f0kes,"Yup, during the whole plot Eren was getting more and more violent and at the moment it wouldn't even matter if he goes back... He does. The only moment i was happy with is Levi finally killing the monke."
Abhinav6singg,radilee21,"Large part review bombing by fans of other series, and people who hated the manga ending who have nothing better to do with their lives than be pissy about a series not ending exactly how they want. 

TLDR: manchildren"
radilee21,Vacation_Jonathan,What's wrong with having an opinion about the ending and giving it a rating?
Vacation_Jonathan,radilee21,Nothing? By all means rate it fairly to what you think. I'm just saying that a majority of the current votes are more than likely from spam accounts or disgruntled folks who haven't actually watched what they're reviewing. That's why looking at reviews for anything is more or less pointless nowadays cause it's 50/50 actual critiques and pointless hate/glazing
Abhinav6singg,forevermoneyrich,Its being review bombed
Abhinav6singg,andrusbaun,"AOT went full GOT. Great show, which reached its peak in the middle of the story.

All we had afterwards were irrational motivations, shallow actions of previously well developed characters, plot armors and lazy writing. Ehh."
andrusbaun,CamomilleGirl,the animation felt rushed again :/
Abhinav6singg,IndianCurry30,I think its alright to hate the ending. But I would also assume you would be nitpicking. suspension of disbelief is a thing people just roll with it. Character motivations all in all stayed the same and these characters are overwhelmingly human.
Abhinav6singg,TheNinja01,Getting review bombed for some reason lol

Abhinav6singg,zacmario66,It was bad . I was really hoping they‚Äôd get rid of the part where Ymir was in love with her rapist
Abhinav6singg,Zephrias,People from TitanFolk lol
Abhinav6singg,K_2Smooth,"Bro it‚Äôs obviously OP fans, one fucking dumbass doing dumbass shit=entire fanbase

By that logic AoT are on the same level of trash if not **WORSE** for shitting on Isayamas onsen 3 years ago when the manga ended

Dumbass logic"
K_2Smooth,suppadelicious,Yeah it definitely has nothing to do with the episode in any way.
Abhinav6singg,Bcat591,Salty bitches are review bombing it

Abhinav6singg,AllHopeGoneBaby,"honestly a 6.2 is fair. It wasn‚Äôt the greatest ending, but watching it was super fun, but it had some pretty bad moments. Seeing the weird creature come out of Eren and actually do shit was by far the coolest thing though, i loved it"
Abhinav6singg,skampini269,I guess 48% of the population is just straight up idiotic
Abhinav6singg,Abnormals_Comic,"its review bombings, and plus its a controversial episode so ending haters will go and rate it low ofc."
Abhinav6singg,ResistingSphere,"I don‚Äôt pay attention much to outside reviews, but holy hell that final episode is shambolic. It‚Äôs a shame how much was riding here and it all fell apart due to contrivances, misguided themes and forgetful writing. Downvote me all you want, but you felt something strange after watching that episode and you know it."
ResistingSphere,Abhinav6singg,Nah bro I watched it it was perfect. You need to understand it better if you don't you can't understand. It's more realistic this way .
Abhinav6singg,ResistingSphere,"Perfect? What about it was perfect? 

Was it the many lucky things that happened:

- Falco being the only know titan shifter with functional wings, and him knowing how to use them with perfection + being able to shift multiple times without seeming fatigue?

- Armin being captured, not insta killed by Ymir even though we know she wanted to destroy humanity and killing Armin would guarantee that? 

-Armin being sent to the Paths for reasons‚Ä¶ to connect with Zeke to resurrect the past titan shifters?

Was it the squandered pay offs:

-The conflict never ends being a terrible way to sign off the show, teasing a new start to the titan powers and showing the infinite birth and rebirth of paradis

-The honorary marleyans reuniting with Annie, Reiner, Gabi and Falco to be ruined by them turning into pure titans (which by the way, was totally inconsequential because they reverted back to human almost minutes later with no detriment) 

-Was it the Commander of Fort Slava saying he‚Äôll never treat Eldians with unjust hatred, only to them begin to perpetuate that hatred again after they revert back to humans? 

- Was it Zeke being killed off by Levi despite having realised his errors of killing so many people? Wouldn‚Äôt it have been so much more rewarding and interesting if he decided to help humanity because he wants to cherish life after his conversation with Armin? 

Was it the stupid decisions of the characters:

-Why did Eren kill 80% of the world‚Äôs populations? To prevent revolt? 

Congratulations, the Jaegeriists are now the most powerful military force on the planet and will continue to kill everyone outside of Paradis.

Why 80%? Why not 20/10/1? That would‚Äôve been enough to showcase the power of the titans. 

- Why did Eren kill his own mother? To save bertholdt so Armin can get the colossal? Why not just send it away m, turn it around and save his mum? That would‚Äôve worked 

-Eren can go into the past and change the future seemingly. So why the fuck would he not cut it off at the source? Why go through the measures to commit mass genocide? 

Was it the many things that make absolutely 0 sense:

- How did Mikasa know Eren was in the Titans mouth? 

-How can Eren turn into a colossal titan after being separated from the parasite, if that‚Äôs the founder? Or is Ymir the founder? Fuck knows 

-Mikasa being chosen to end the cycle of hatred because of love for Eren, like Ymir loved Fritz? What? That‚Äôs loose and doesn‚Äôt hold 

-Why choose Mikasa after 2000 years to free her from her love from Fritz? Why? How? 

-Why did Ymir allow the reawakening of the past titan shifter? 

-Rumbling stops because Zeke dies, Eren loses contact with royal blood. But what about S2? Eren touches Dina‚Äôs hand for a split second and he can control titans for long after that?

-What happened to the parasite thing after Eren dies? You never see it again? 

-The absolute clusterfuck of death baiting. 

It‚Äôs loose, bad and is full of lucky consequences to make things happen."

Abhinav6singg,Reddykid24,"I don't get it. I saw the final episode, and it's devoid of very unfortunate mistranslations and given the Paradis island became futurerisitc (making me believe it got blown to smithereens around 2060) that implies virtually all of the surviving characters we know and loved had a peaceful life and a peaceful death as no wars happend until some bloke started one, and sure, the final scene implies that a new generation of titans will come...but given the improved weaponry and technology we saw, I think they'll he easily dispatched and killed.

Now uh, how do I leave a reminder to come back here in 6 months for when the Dub comes out?"
Abhinav6singg,MidlightStar,Because it took five years.
Abhinav6singg,JohnArtemus,"The ending definitely leaves a lot to be desired, but I think that was the point. 

Great writing and storytelling but I personally had a problem with the entire premise of the show once it was revealed.  About Ymir doing all of this because of, essentially, Stockholm Syndrome in regards to King Fritz, and the fact that in the end, nothing is really resolved.

Meaning, according to the credits scenes, Paradis still gets destroyed with the implication being the Titans will return with that kid walking into the tree.

Which also reminds me that the origins of this demon/god or whatever that initially possessed Ymir is never explained.  Which means it's still out there, waiting for the next person to find it.  And it appears that person does.

In the end, the only thing that is certain is that Eren and Armin are reunited in Hell where they'll be together forever.

Yay?"
Abhinav6singg,Iusuallywearglasses,"Spoiler:

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not a happy ending. Or at least, not an outright happy ending.

I don‚Äôt really understand the time stuff, but my assumption is that Eren lived with Mikasa in the Paths until he died and gave her that memory.

I thought the ending was great and I really appreciate how it stayed dark. I enjoyed that there wasn‚Äôt this Eureka moment to essentially cause a Naruto/Pain moment where all the damage is reversed.

The only thing I hated was the music at the start of the episode- I hate that it felt like an AMV."

Abhinav6singg,Keshan345,"It's now 10k votes and still 6.2. It's not getting better. This is becoming like Game of thrones.

AshiraLAdonai,Eastern_Comfortable2,"I didn‚Äôt watch till after S2 had aired , I had no idea till then."
AshiraLAdonai,Grif_the_Crit,"Depends on if you meant when it was released in general. You likely mean when the anime first aired in Japan, which I likely was busy studying about leprechaun lore and playing with paper cut outs of leprechauns.

However, I do have a pretty impactful memory from first seeing the teaser of it on Toonami I believe earlier in the week before its release on it. I may have only been around 9.5 years old but even then I knew this show would have a massive impact in not just shows but culture as well, even if I wasn't entirely obvious of such then.

After some research, I believe the date was May 1st of 2014, due to several reasons:

* The teaser I saw seemed to have been of the Toonami teaser of it, as, while my memory isn't perfect, the imagery and movements seem to be akin to how I saw them first .
* It was around when *The Cleveland Show*'s ""A Cleveland Brown Christmas"" aired around, I believe, between 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM, which was confirmed to be around 9:30 PM, though the teaser was either showed several times before and/or after that.
* The fore mention episode aired in a particular time: not only was it almost summer but it was also nearing the end of the school year, though it was a school night, I believe.

I was at one of my mom's friend's place, which had a pool we used a lot earlier so I was the only one up at the time, though I was both getting tired and bored watching the TV at the time. Then, it happened: I saw the *AOT* teaser.

Now, I had already known anime existed at the time, though I didn't know much and the only anime I had watched were some episodes of *DBZ* (The episodes that had Video vs Spopovichi, and when Gohan was about to fight but was ganged up on), the first episode of *Naruto Shipuden* and some of the *Pokemon* anime; other than that, I did not know much about the genre. *Attack on Titan* seemed... different, to say the least, from other shows, even for an anime; much darker yet had a profound feel to it.

I was shocked with how brutal it was being presented, it being a teaser and all. There was so much more gore and death than I had seen done in any other animated movie or show before. Most importantly, though, were the feelings I felt that I didn't feel from other shows. I felt a sense of dread, as if I knew there was no other option but death there, yet that also gave a sense of... moving forward, I suppose is the best way I could put it; it felt there was some room to move, rather than inevitable suffocation and being crushed by instant death. Looking back, I think I know why: there was some possibility of survival, faint and clouded by death but still a sight for freedom beyond it. I felt the desperate screaming of raw human emotion, fear but also determination. I could see Eren's rage and fight against such alien concepts. It felt... real, or rather the harsh reality of the world.

I didn't consciously think most of these then, but I remember my emotions and I can tell why I felt them, as well as some of my thoughts. What I did consciously think then, however, was that this would change media as a whole; it wouldn't just change what shows and animation could accomplish and be shown, but, in a way, society as a whole through our minds.

I didn't see any reference of it again until 3 years later at a summer camp, with one of the other cabin mates brining a volume with them. I saw and remembered the alien feelings I felt then, with the strange movements and poses of the giant, naked titans, and the brutality of death shown by not just how one was eaten but the fear and helplessness shown when being eaten.

It is safe to say it is living forever in my mind."

paperbirdus,Hi_Im_Daisey,word
paperbirdus,Hamlet134,"Damn bro, I'm glad i chose to open this post and read it. I related to and enjoyed everything in that!!"
paperbirdus,Kira_Yoshikage2,Watched aot back in like 2017 when I first started watching anime after I was watching yu gi oh cause it was a childhood favourite and then I watched death note and then came on to attack on Titan. And I must say it is single handedly the best anime out there season 1 got me hooked season 2 was even better and then season 3 part 1 which people disliked for some reason was honestly a masterpiece and then I started reading the manga and that‚Äôs when AOT became number one for me cause I still really liked death note. But season 3 part 2 was where it‚Äôs at the animation (big up wit studio for making goated anime‚Äôs like kabaneri otif and Vinland saga) but the OST‚Äôs the animation and the fights were on point
paperbirdus,SerbianStickman,"Attack on Titan made promises that it kept, and it will continue to do so, to us, to me and... to you. 2000 years from now."
Hampcole,Im_a_raddish,"Yeah, I recently just finished watching Tokyo Ghoul.  The first season is good but season 2 sucks. The follow-up Tokyo Ghoul re is just garbage."
paperbirdus,x3erstal,Boutta share this post to all my friends who don‚Äôt agree that Attack on Titan is the best anime ever made. Thank you OP.
paperbirdus,superdolmiosauce,"Spoilers for the end of season 3

When we see the restorationists getting turned into titans, just like how dina is the same titan that ate erens mum, all of grishas friends wre the same titans we see decimate eren and armins squad in the battle of trost, even the santa titan! I won't lie i felt kinda giddy when i first noticed that."
paperbirdus,darthcoughcough,Well said! Attack on Titan is truly a masterpiece. It is by far my favorite series of all time.
paperbirdus,Badsuns7,"I‚Äôd like to add on the characters and the real-aspect of the show. In season 1 we‚Äôre presented with the Levi squad which were elite, highly skilled soldiers with numerous Titan kills amongst them.  The female titan crushes them, despite aspects such as Petra (possibly?) going to marry Levi or atleast being a romantic interest.  Truly devastating to watch them die, and even have Levi be confronted by Petra‚Äôs father upon the Scouts‚Äô return inside the walls. Those moments elicit some serious feelings of intrigue and fear that I just wanted to share it here."
Badsuns7,darthcoughcough,Petra :'(
paperbirdus,Hampcole,"This post brought a tear to my eye, until now I have never realized just how big of a influence this show has been for me. It has always been there thick and thin. Thank you"
paperbirdus,Im_a_raddish,Question: What is your favorite opening in this series? I like S1OP2 the best.
Im_a_raddish,paperbirdus,"S1OP2: Eldia's National Anthem

&#x200B;

That's a tough choice-- I love all of them! 

You got the nostalgia of the first one, the patriotism of the second, SASAGEYO, the heart-felt emotion of the fourth...

I really like the fifth one! It feels like an amalgamation of what has come before, with leitmotifs from S1OP1 and the visuals of the other ones.

S3OP2 really captures the feeling of culmination-- the idea that all the events of the past seasons have been leading up to this finale, the final battle of the story that started in Season One, on that day the Colossal and Armored Titans first decided to appear."
paperbirdus,Im_a_raddish,I like that one also. S3OP2 is probably #2 for me

isthatabingo,NoDadNoTears,"I'm gonna be real disappointed if it turns out there's a part 3 coming in a year.   

Because if that's the case then the entire ""final season"" marketing thing was pretty manipulative."
NoDadNoTears,isthatabingo,That‚Äôs exactly how I feel
NoDadNoTears,DeadZeus007,Totally agree... makes no sense to call it the final season when there are 3 parts with almost a year of break between them... should just be a new season then. I agree it's very manipulative.
DeadZeus007,Ill_Carpenter_8891,"I would cut MAPPA some slack though, I think it should've been released as a whole, at least I heard that the producers wanted to end close to the manga ending, but there was not enough time."
DeadZeus007,Yorak-Hunt,Yeah they honestly should‚Äôve just done season 4 and 5‚Ä¶
NoDadNoTears,ver-bek,"I o ly recently started watching, because it was in the final season. And now I'm hooked. They got me good."
ver-bek,Common_Sinz,Consider yourself lucky.  Many of us have been watching and waiting for over a span of almost 10 years.
NoDadNoTears,kinnell,"The problem is that once you use the ""final season"" naming once, you're stuck using it.

Like, imagine if they had all original intentions to wrap everything in 2 cours. They decide to market it as the ""final season"" because that's what it will be. Doing multiple cours is not atypical.

But once they realized they had production issues, they opted to prioritize the quality and break things down to give animators more time and do more justice. However, it's two late to go back and change marketing that has already been released into the world.

Hindsight is 20-20. It probably seemed reasonable to them initially to wrap everything up in 2 cours. Would you have preferred them to rush it and give us substandard quality? I'd rather take some ""misleading"" marketing over rushed production resulting in shitty quality.

The primary point I'm trying to make here is that the misleading marketing mistake only needed to happen once in the past. They're not intentionally being manipulative every single time after that because it's too late to change your mind at that point. They may even regret it themselves, but I'm glad they made the decision to postpone in attempts to do the story justice than try to rush everything into 1 cour."
kinnell,isthatabingo,"The pacing has been glacial in season 4 part 2. They absolutely could‚Äôve covered everything, but I am convinced they decided to drag it out in order to milk the franchise. I 100% believe a movie is in the works. Therefore, they can say the marketing wasn‚Äôt technically false. Manipulative? Yes. False? Nope."
NoDadNoTears,kykusan,I will just gonna read the manga if that's the case.It's just BS.
NoDadNoTears,distalented,"Nah it‚Äôs gonna be a movie, with what‚Äôs left after this episode, it‚Äôs around 3 or 4 episodes worth of crap. They‚Äôre probably gonna have a release date of next year, or near the end of the year if we‚Äôre lucky."
isthatabingo,jesusrodriguezm,"With the money made by The Mugen Train id Demon Slayer, everybody wants that‚Ä¶ fist a lot of money at the cinemas‚Ä¶ the release it chopped in episodes.

Dragon Ball Brolly made a decent amount of money also‚Ä¶"
jesusrodriguezm,kykusan,The Mugen train was absolutely genius in marketing.
kykusan,Maybe-Im-Trash,What did they do?
isthatabingo,mjr_oc3lot,"Yeah I'm so disappointed, I just want to know when and how we will get the next segment."
isthatabingo,rayk10k,Considering the numbers AoT gets they‚Äôd be stupid not to finish the adaption
rayk10k,awesomlyawesome,"The issue isn't that they may or may not adapt it. At least viewers think so. Many of our issues are in HOW and WHEN they will adapt it. They haven't given us anything on that, even though they're leaving us on cliffhangers. But there's little to no doubt in my mind they're going to adapt it. Its just frustrating to not now how long it's going to take or how its gonna be given to me. üò≠
But im waiting for quality so I will survive."
awesomlyawesome,cidalkimos,They always release that info after the last episode. Why do y‚Äôall stay acting brand new?
isthatabingo,restinstress,"Pretty sure that there's going to either be a movie or a final part next year. Movie makes more sense given how much money Demon Slayer made and consider AoT is a much longer, much better story. It might break the record again."
isthatabingo,TimeTravelingYams,"Going to be a movie or another season, my guess is a movie"
TimeTravelingYams,isthatabingo,"I know, but it definitely seemed like they were going to use the panel to make such an announcement, and then they troll us with a blu ray announcement instead. I‚Äôm honestly kind of impressed."
isthatabingo,plscallmeRain,"Season 4 ""Part 2"" wasn't announced until after the finale.

How are you surprised?"
plscallmeRain,isthatabingo,This is my first time watching the show in real time. I am not aware of their past shenanigans lol but this information is certainly illuminating
isthatabingo,TorchRunner,imagine waiting 4 years for season 2üôÉ
isthatabingo,cidalkimos,You doing all this complaining and you didn‚Äôt even suffer all the other long waits????
isthatabingo,ReallyColdMonkeys,"Dude seriously. I been refreshing the subreddit all day because I thought we were gonna get some big ""announcement"" because of the panel. I'm getting irritated lol"
isthatabingo,CrazyKitty86,Next will be ‚ÄúAttack on Titan Season 4 Final Season Final Part We Mean It‚Äù and the theme song is ‚ÄúI Mean It‚Äù by G-Eazy
isthatabingo,magicman1145,It's extremely bizarre. Leaving fans in the dark for your final season is pretty insulting
isthatabingo,some1CLIPthat,I imagine the announcement will come a few hours or a day after next weeks episode as I believe part one did announcing part two
isthatabingo,Sifu-Jacob,They are going to milk this for everything it‚Äôs worth before they release the last few adapted chapters because they know that some people will not like it. Just like after the manga ended. Not saying my position one way or the other in regards to the ending. Just saying that it is likely going to be a bit controversial.
isthatabingo,loadingonepercent,Anime only ending confirmed let‚Äôs gooooooooooo /s
isthatabingo,BelchingBooch,"Mappa shit the bed. WIT should've stuck with their baby. I don't understand why the hell they'd walk away from the biggest anime of the decade... Season 3 was PEAK animation. Looked so much like the Manga, but beautiful and vibrant, and the action sequences were incredible. Mappa sucks with their shit CGI and awkward facial expressions and character movement. Now we don't even know wtf they're gonna do to end the anime properly"
isthatabingo,Nathansjl,How do we even know we only have one episode left?
Nathansjl,awesomlyawesome,"They have a set amount of anime episodes planned usually so we typically always know the number of episodes (and title for them) before the season ends. And the next √©pisode is going to be the last for this season. Short answer, plenty of leaks and info."
isthatabingo,Moist_Smile3834,Hmmm..... I wonder why they left 9 unadapted chapters
Moist_Smile3834,isthatabingo,"I mean it‚Äôs clearly because they‚Äôre making a movie, but it‚Äôs pissing me off that they won‚Äôt just announce that."
isthatabingo,patrick2133,So no original ending ?
isthatabingo,Brendan2803,Read the manga
Brendan2803,isthatabingo,"Already read it, I‚Äôm just more of a visual person."
isthatabingo,Brendan2803,Fair enough
isthatabingo,xj_tj_,They‚Äôre gonna game of thrones this thing
isthatabingo,luciogamert,"Yeah they just gonna end it next episode. No more aot after that. /s
 
You're a dumb af for thinking that dude."
luciogamert,isthatabingo,"That‚Äôs not what I insinuated at all. I believe there will be a movie, and I‚Äôm annoyed they are leaving fans in the dark."
isthatabingo,HamachiBeans,"I mean the ‚Äúfinal season‚Äù marketing was smart since it worked, aot is as popular as it has ever been since season 1, so as annoying as all this unexpected waiting is, you can‚Äôt really blame the people who chose to market it this way, which isn‚Äôt even mappa"
isthatabingo,SuperPuper001,"The delay was not because of the Anime announcement, there were other reasons for that. The announcement of the continuation of the anime has always been after the last series."
isthatabingo,aineri,Obviuosly attack on titan  movie is being planned
isthatabingo,Mighty_Djole,Arent they gonna do a movie
isthatabingo,QuestioningEspecialy,hour-long episode maybe?
QuestioningEspecialy,isthatabingo,They‚Äôd need AT LEAST 2 hours to cover everything that‚Äôs remaining
joaopaulofoo,Umer123321,Armin Mikasa and Eren have finally seen the Sea.
Umer123321,ashai1994,How? where
ashai1994,Umer123321,Literally the ending bit that looks so well animated
joaopaulofoo,Jdep11,"As a anime only viewer I was completely blown away by this season. The fight scenes and animation were extremely well done just like previous seasons, but I was never expecting the story to be as intricate and compelling as it was. This last episode in particular really hit home on the emotional aspect of things. I‚Äôm really curious as to how they can top it off with the next season."
Jdep11,LordNelson27,"Every time I think they can‚Äôt get even more in the weeds with classic ww1 and ww2 war literature themes, they go and have literal Jewish ghettos. It‚Äôs like watching an anime adaptation of all quiet on the western front.

Edit: ...with with giant naked people and swords"
LordNelson27,Alderdash,"I read All Quiet on the Western Front many, many moons ago in high school English, and had the same thought. 

Particularly all the young folk being sent out to die without really knowing why. I could never face reading it again..."
Jdep11,lasnoopacabra,Levi vs Beast Titan still makes the hair on my neck stand
lasnoopacabra,staybentt,One of the best fight scenes of the franchise. Was literally screaming at the tv.
lasnoopacabra,Disco_Fighter,Haha!! Goosebumps
lasnoopacabra,Serendiplodocus,I have watched that fight about 10 times now.  Amazing
lasnoopacabra,zorfog,"Insane how despite all odds the scouts managed to capture or kill all 3 of Reiner Bertholt and Zeke. That big mouthed, all fours titan has to be a shifter, right?"
lasnoopacabra,TurnipFire,That and Erwin‚Äôs charge. Holy shit this show delivers and just doesn‚Äôt stop
lasnoopacabra,Dresir,Im speculating that the beast titan is grishas son.
lasnoopacabra,mechengr17,"And then he accidentally let him get away bc he was so desperate to save at least one person, bc he had no idea if anyone from Eren and Armin's squad survived 


Him crying out, asking if someone survived was one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen 


And then to lose the beast titan üò≠üò≠üò≠


And then I went and watched the choice with no regrets ova...."
joaopaulofoo,zONsObito,Judging from the way the titan in this episode moved forward (when he made his way up to where he lied) it seems like Marley took a baby and turned it into a titan
zONsObito,Adoxx1409,"But wasn't it implied that the titan felt sad when Eren talked? Maybe that was just me, interesting theory! Especially since i think that the paradise people need new hate going for them."
Adoxx1409,cowboydirtydan,"He referred to the crawling titan as ""a fellow patriot"" (that's how the subs I had translated it anyways) which implies more complex thoughts than a baby is capable of."
zONsObito,XxMemeStar69xX,I also think that Titan was a baby
XxMemeStar69xX,AustinKunTV,Eren said it was a patriot
zONsObito,PM_ME_YOUR_CUPPA,Wasn't it also implied that the amount of titan spinal fluid that is injected into a human will effect the size the titan will be? It could be that not a lot was used hence the deformed shape.
PM_ME_YOUR_CUPPA,KirkDaJerk,"I know I'm late, but I was going to say this too....also, I think it's how they take in the fluid causes deformity.  Either by ingesting it, injecting in various parts of the body, etc..."
zONsObito,KingGink99,"I‚Äôm pretty sure the titan was a Marley rebel that worked with Eren‚Äôs dad. Eren said it was a ‚Äúfellow patriot,‚Äù also the trees that were growing in the path the titan was crawling on emphasized how slow the titan was moving, so it makes sense if it was transformed all that time ago (same time Dina was transformed)."
KingGink99,avidjockey,I thought he just meant that it was a fellow Eldian.
zONsObito,postcardmap45,Ooooh sh*t!
zONsObito,Shawn_Spenstar,Doubtful since Erin said he was a fellow Patriot not a fellow eldarin or however you spell it.
joaopaulofoo,HOCHIHO,"''What's waiting for us on the other side of the ocean is the enemy right? So if we kill the enemy, the one waiting for us on the other side. Will we...finally be free?'' I was so emotional and crying."
HOCHIHO,nyarlathotepisyummy,Saaaaame. This show and the fuken feelzzzz
HOCHIHO,Toasterman2k,I was so mad. Goddamnit Eren just let everyone be happy on the beach. I giggled my ass off when Mikasa got scared by the water
joaopaulofoo,Norra-T,"Does anybody else love the character development on Jean? 

From being a selfish brat, to developing a friendship with Armin end of season 1, Being unable to kill at the beginning of season 3 to being able to take down one of Kenny‚Äôs men, and now defending Eren this final episode season 3.

Also the parallel of Floch to Jean‚Äôs character at the beginning of the series.

Love it."
Norra-T,Anomaleon,"Jean is one of my favorite characters in the series precisely because his development is much more relatable.

I don't think Floch is the parallel you think he is, though, but I suppose he's also a more grounded, ""non-heroic"" character like early Jean."
Anomaleon,Norra-T,"Exactly cause I‚Äôm sure most people would be ‚Äúno thanks I‚Äôm living a simple life‚Äù

I love it

Yeah idk maybe I‚Äôm thinking about Jean was always attacking Eren and company and how Floch is. I wonder how Floch will develop in the last season or if he‚Äôll receive an early death. I‚Äôm always interested in side characters ."
Norra-T,NaughtyDreadz,I wanna know about connie's mum. Will they finish that story? Also what about Annie and Ymir? That needs some conclusion.
NaughtyDreadz,zorfog,"I think the story there is that Zeke (and whoever else is working with them?) went to Connie‚Äôs hometown and injected the people with the titan serum, presumably while they were sleeping? Cause iirc Connie and the other scouts are sitting around in the late morning when they get the word about titans inside the walls."
NaughtyDreadz,sanocer,"We don‚Äôt know about those except for Ymir, we know that she returned with Betolt and Reiner so that they could bring back her titan that was originally theirs. In her letter to Historia she says that she knows she will die soon - to be eaten by another, probably"
Norra-T,med_oni,Also really liked how you could tell he was trying to cheer Eren up during the latest season when Eren was being all gloomy before they went on that final mission. He kept making faces and needling him until Eren was up for a fight.
joaopaulofoo,absolutechonker,The face Eren was making after kissing Historia‚Äôs hand gave me chills. I thought for sure something bad was going to happen.
absolutechonker,Morita23,He looked like King Crimson in that scene
Morita23,Nanfrostcrystal,IS THAT A JOJO REFRENCE?
absolutechonker,JadeSerpant,"Nah, Eren loves Historia (unfortunately for Mikasa). He won't do anything to harm her."
JadeSerpant,JohnArtemus,"Isn't Historia gay?  I'm just curious.  I know Ymir was in love with her but wasn't sure if Historia felt the same way.  It would be interesting to see her and Eren together, but I hope they avoid a soap opera love triangle with Eren, Historia and Mikasa.  That would be so un-Attack on Titan."
JadeSerpant,cowboydirtydan,I'm not sure Mikasa is actually after Eren in that way. She may just have some serious childhood/sibling/platonic love going on there. But I haven't read the Manga.
JadeSerpant,SimonShepherd,"I don't think it's necessarily romantic love, if it's any other 104th fellow who has royal blood, he won't want to sacrifice them either."
joaopaulofoo,Bashizzle,"‚ÄúHey... if we kill all our enemies... over there... will we finally.. be free?‚Äù

I served in Iraq and Afghanistan and that last line (along with the ending credits with the war montage) hit me like a ton of bricks. War is hell. Period. And the violence between factions of people only brings pain to everyone involved. The painful irony of fighting for freedom by taking the life and freedom away from another. 

A perfect, thoughtful season finale in my book."
Bashizzle,Literally_A_Shill,"One of the first things I thought of when I heard that. 

I remember how it was a rallying cry back then. ""Fight them over there so that we can live free here."""
Literally_A_Shill,roguemerc96,"I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill em all!"
Bashizzle,ekulpotamus,I'm starting to think that the king was actually in the right this whole time by trying to maintain peace. Changing memories was a little cruel but I think he understood the price of war better than anyone else. My guess is the Eldians live in peace only on paradise and are left alone by Marley
ekulpotamus,JingleFett,"The thought crossed my mind too. At the same time though, Marley only left them alone until they sent the three amigos to bust down the wall and wipe everyone out. Given the ww2 symbolism maybe the king was inspired by Neville Chamberlain..."
ekulpotamus,zorfog,"He sort of had the right idea, I think. Obviously the power of titans is monstrous and horrifyingly destructive and ideally should never be used. But the way they went about it was horrible. They wiped the memories of a whole civilization and turned them into terrified clueless animals in a huge cage. 

The best solution would‚Äôve actually resulted in a sort of paradise, rather than the world we see within the walls. At this point I‚Äôm not sure how I would want to move forward. Crossing the sea to attack Marley just proves them right and creates more horror. Maybe the citizens of the walls should just be allowed to settle the island that they‚Äôre all on? That, without the threat of titans outside their mysterious walls, could be a sort of actual paradise."
Bashizzle,eatwhitetofu,Thank you for your service.
joaopaulofoo,x_TDeck_x,Goodbye to all the anime-onlies who will pick up the manga after this season. Was a fun ride!
x_TDeck_x,redokonogi,"I waited years for season 2 without touching the manga. One year is nothing

Resistance 100"
redokonogi,nkid299,you i like you
x_TDeck_x,Konko_,"I was one of them. Be strong boys, off to the manga."
Konko_,Matheusj99,I'll keep being strong. I'LL WAIT
Konko_,MadFlava76,"Ha, I was off to the manga after the end of season 1."
x_TDeck_x,ArosHD,"Which chapter corresponds to this episode?

edit: episode 59 = chapter 90"
ArosHD,barteag,"Which is Volume 21, right? I googled it, but wanted to make sure. I'll pick up the manga from here... I just can't wait until next year üòï"
ArosHD,Cris888479,would also like to know
x_TDeck_x,YerBoyDers,I'm really having an internal struggle with it! I want to know more. I think having a date for the anime is helping my resolve
x_TDeck_x,namelesshobo1,"I caved in after season 3 part 1, and I can honestly say reading the manga has only enhanced my enjoyment of the anime. Knowing what's going to happen and being excited to see it animated and scored and (voice) acted out is fantastic. I already have certain scenes and shots I'm excited for, and oh man is season 4 going to be something special."
x_TDeck_x,TheChiefPontiac,"I‚Äôve been with the anime since the beginning. The wait was crushing. Four years till season 2. Then season 3 suddenly didn‚Äôt air completely. 
I just can‚Äôt stand the waiting anymore. 
Farewell, brother! I‚Äôll be waiting on the other side with the manga readers."
x_TDeck_x,KappaKai77,After years of fighting it i decided to start reading after the basement episode. I finnished everythin keft in 5 days.
KappaKai77,verticaluzi,Worth it?
x_TDeck_x,AnguisViridis,"I've reverting to anime-only - knowing how faithful the show has been, this season made me wish I'd held off reading the manga after Season 2."
x_TDeck_x,bradisun,"I‚Äôm going to stay strong and wait.  Only read one spoiler but that‚Äôs my fault for looking at the wiki for a certain character.

I‚Äôve been tempted in the past but I know with my anime-only brethren I can do it"
x_TDeck_x,Ewoksintheoutfield,"I am a on anime only but want to check out the manga. Do you know what issue ""season 4"" starts with?"
Ewoksintheoutfield,x_TDeck_x,"I'm not familiar with any manga so I don't really know for sure. Someone in the comments said this episode was Chapter 90 but again, I can't vouch for that persinally. Sorry but best of luck!"
x_TDeck_x,al_capone420,we only have to wait until next april - i can do that
al_capone420,OddEye,I thought it's not coming out until Fall 2020?
al_capone420,TheProky,"Autumn 2020, year and a half from now."
joaopaulofoo,thewingidingi,"God attack on titan has probably the most fleshed out world I‚Äôve ever seen in all of anime 

I‚Äôm so invested in the lore because of how bizarre it is to eat others and like there were entire countries going to war it‚Äôs fucking crazy man"
thewingidingi,cowboydirtydan,FMA: B is really fleshed out too. I'm very impressed with AoT's deep backstory and intercultural/racial dynamics in a similar way to FMA's Ishvalans.
joaopaulofoo,Matheusj99,"I really want to see how Marley held up for all these years, have they changed at all? Do they have newer technology? And all that stuff"
Matheusj99,postcardmap45,How many years have passed exactly since Grisha left Marley?
joaopaulofoo,MIGFirestorm,I didn't even realize this season only had 22 episodes. Im fucking SHOOK now.
MIGFirestorm,thatfruitontop,Is it already on hulu or crunchy roll?
thatfruitontop,lYeezusChrist,Yes.
joaopaulofoo,absolute_fkn_ledge,"that final episode was so bitter sweet, to finally find the truth only to realize what you have to do now is the last thing you wanted. I love Erwins character for representing the truth and how his legacy carries out in his soliders. 

It's so great to see the main trio from where they started in the show to finally reaching the ocean. So much has happened and this ending really did it right."
absolute_fkn_ledge,Ewoksintheoutfield,"Yeah the ending was so bittersweet.  To finally reach the ocean and ""freedom"" only to discover they have to fight another war."
joaopaulofoo,Adoxx1409,"I was kinda disappointed that today's episode had such an epilog feeling - on the other hand, what did i expect? Emo-Eren hopefully changes when war comes, which will come, i guess.

At last i just wanted to say that this season was really great and the fact that the next season is already confirmed is so comfy xD Just gotta keep strong and don't read the manga.

Edit: And is it just me or are we going to see Eren running around with  vials full with Historia's blood? Or using Zeke for that in due time.."
Adoxx1409,LordNelson27,He‚Äôs gonna fight zeke for sure
LordNelson27,splifs,I hope he punches zeke so hard in the face his arm is totally obliterated and zeke‚Äôs head flies like a furry cannonball into the moon
Adoxx1409,JohnArtemus,"Eren has already changed.  If you noticed he spared that titan in the field and called him a fellow patriot.  He then pointed across the sea and wondered if they killed all the enemies ""over there"" would they be free, then?

He even looked different (hair longer, more mature and grim).  So, I didn't get the sense this was emo-Eren **at all.**  In fact, I got the sense that he was now a changed man."
JohnArtemus,MordorfTheSenile,Not going to lie I hate the new haircut
Adoxx1409,Hampamatta,"i wonder if marley is going to have crude jets by now.

why dont they just send bomber zepelins in to wreck everything? or are they not aware that the eldians have crude gunpowder tech and no combustion engines. or is this a secret war that they dont want the public to know about, but htat doesnt make sense either as no one over there seems to like eldians."
Hampamatta,Adoxx1409,"Well, zepelins are shot down easily and still dependant on weather and wind conditions, while bombs are quite expensive, I guess. Also they would fear the founding titan until recently, no? King Fritz said something like ""come and a million titans will be unleashed"", didn't he? 

But I think that Marley's public knows about paradise, so that's a point. And didn't they tell their public that paradise has lot of natural resources and a grand army? 

Now that you questioned it, I am quite unsure what to make of it."
Adoxx1409,Ardbark7471,That not reading the manga part is going to be hard af lol
Adoxx1409,GodrichOfTheAbyss,I‚Äôm pretty sure Zeke wouldn‚Äôt want to fight eren if he knew that eren can control zeke‚Äôs own titans by touching him
Adoxx1409,Prof_Black,"Eren when from emo to destiny warrior.

What a transition! 

He looked to the horizon and saw his end goal. 
It‚Äôs not what he expected but he will see it through. He finally understands his fathers goals."
joaopaulofoo,giacokr,"I loved the episode, but I got one thing that bothered me, maybe someone can clear it up for me. 

I understand that Kruger killed every Marleyan soldier on Paradis that was turning Eldians into new titans, however, I don't understand why the Marleyans wouldn't just send new people to the post, why would they just abandon it?  (To me it was implied that it was abandoned because no new titans had appeared and the survey corps rode past the wall by the sea without being worried of being seen.)"
giacokr,Nineteen1194,"From my understanding, as Armin was saying as a narration voice, it took them a year to go back to explore from Trost to the sea. The exploration bataillon killed all the titans in the meantime I think. This is why there is no new Titans, they killed them during that time and maybe the Marleys' did not send new people to Paradis at the same time because they are preparing the war."
Nineteen1194,Matheusj99,"Also, I think they Marleyan soldiers don't hold their position there. They only go there once they have enough Eldians to turn to titans, probably"
Nineteen1194,300andWhat,"So if I understood correctly, they re-took all the walls, and then went out past them to roam and kill all the titans outside of the walls, so basically the entire island is pretty much titan free?"
giacokr,Space_Pirate_Roberts,"Fairly sure it was never permanently manned; they‚Äôd just bring prisoners, titanize them, and leave. There‚Äôs no structure for anyone to be stationed in IIRC, just the pier and the wall."
giacokr,Shawn_Spenstar,"Was it always a manned position? It seemed like they came out in boats to turn the rebels into Titans and then we're heading back that's why the soldier that killed Grishnas sister told the other soldiers to go back to the boat and leave Owl, Grishna and him alone because they were almost done. There's not really much need to garrison the walls there from Marleys PoV they know the king isn't planning on fighting or invading and there is a sea between the island and Marley so there's no threat from the pure Titans, really there is no point to a standing garrison there."
giacokr,GodrichOfTheAbyss,"AFAIK it‚Äôs not a post, they come by ship to turn eldians then go back, Marley must have thought they messed up or caught at sea"
giacokr,lightmonkey,"From Marely's perspective there is no need to keep guards there. As far as they know, the King of the Walls has stollen all knowledge of Marley. In 100 years no one from within the walls has gone to Marley, so why would they today? It would be wasteful to pay guards to sit there."
joaopaulofoo,snickittyboopbop,"Really feeling sensitive, positive energy, young Keanu Reeves long hair Eren"
joaopaulofoo,GioMike,"now pay attention HBO, that's how you do a bittersweet ending and its not even the final season."
joaopaulofoo,ch0k3,I was not expecting for everyone in the walls to find out they are eldian. I was not expecting that ending
ch0k3,MysticEden,Me too...
joaopaulofoo,Stormlord1441,Mikasa is a fucking queen
Stormlord1441,Rocketbird,acually is historia
Rocketbird,Stormlord1441,oh fuck u right
Adoxx1409,thugnazzeh,"In s2 ymir also talked to historia, so ion think its because of the royal blood"
Shalashashka,aemzso,"It hasn't been explicitly said, and frankly, we do know of one pure Titan that could talk."
mishka919,Space_Pirate_Roberts,You were ‚Äúthinking‚Äù that? Bruh we knew Donkey Kong‚Äôs name was Zeke before we knew that was the name of Grisha‚Äôs first kid. :p The other shifters from Marley address him as ‚ÄúWarchief Zeke.‚Äù
joaopaulofoo,Mizore148,I'm not quite sure what about the memory he was shown when touching Historia shocked him so much he turned emo? I thought he knew what happened there already. Can anyone explain?
Mizore148,AllNightDS,"only  a theory, but he probably did not see everything of the past.  
when he touched historia, he saw another section of the past, he earlier did not know.

eren thought, his father killed the whole reiss family, because kruger told him to get their titan.  
what eren did not know until he touched historias hand was, that erens father actually tried to convince the reiss family to give everyone back their memory, in order to prevent the death of his family ( he seemed really frustrated if u remember).  
but the reis family rejected his request.  
the conclusion: eren first thought the titans were to blame -> wrong, the martyr transformed all the tians ->  
eren then thought that the martyrs are to blame. ->  
well, he still thinks that probably, but now he also knows, that the reiss family is to blame as well, because they didnt even try to help preventing the death of erens family.  
eren's only reason to slaugther all the titans was the death of his mother.  
and know the death of his mother is at the expense of martyr AND historias relative family."
AllNightDS,Matheusj99,"But it's already known the Reiss family are the assholes of the story, they're the ones keeping it a secret. I think it's something more than that, it has to be, he went completely numb and that memory doesn't really explain that."
AllNightDS,postcardmap45,"Wait how did Grisha know Eren and mom were in danger that he pleaded to the Founding Titan?Did he know the Colossal would attack soon? 


Also who‚Äôs The Martyr again? 


(PS: if these are manga spoiler questions don‚Äôt answer :) )"
Mizore148,rQaBabaca,"The previous memory he saw of that incident was just the attack Grisha made on the Royal Family, which painted him as more of a monster. This showed his emotional & passionate plea with the family before-hand"
rQaBabaca,ImNotL0ud,Yeah I‚Äôm sure the shock from this realization is what overwhelmed him
Mizore148,ShoxV,"If you remember from earlier in s3, Eren actually wanted historia to eat him because he felt his father was in the wrong for stealing the power from Reiss family."
joaopaulofoo,TheIronCannoli,"They say that all anime‚Äôs have a ‚Äúbeach episode‚Äù, and for me, this new episode tops them all. God this show is amazing, I‚Äôll try my hardest to wait and not read the manga."
TheIronCannoli,Rocketbird,This series should've just been called Let's Go to the Beach
TheIronCannoli,mechengr17,"I know


Even the normally emotionless Levi was dumbstruck by the sea 


He didnt even know how to react 


And him telling Hange ""dont touch that, it could be poisonous was so Levi"" ü§£ü§£ü§£"
joaopaulofoo,crazzedsmurf,"Eren the broken, the three eyed titan"
crazzedsmurf,Literally_A_Shill,"Mad king Eren.

Literally_A_Shill,Lord_M_G_Albo,This is such an uncomfortable parallel between Eren and Daenerys lol.
crazzedsmurf,shredler,Winter finally came to wall Maria and Trost district
joaopaulofoo,Avalanche687,Wait is this the last episode until 2020???
joaopaulofoo,FingerBlasting,They changed the animation style a few episodes ago right? It was super apparent this episode and it was throwing me off
FingerBlasting,Albert_Caboose,"Yeah seems like a throwback to early season 1. Makes sense seeing as this arc is sort of a culmination of everything started back then. 

The outlines are a lot harder. Similar to a cell-shaded art-style. I'm fine with it, honestly. It's a nice visual tool to harken back to season 1 when all we cared about was knowing more about the world outside the wall."
joaopaulofoo,AllNightDS,does anyone know the name of the end credits song?
AllNightDS,sc4366,I think it's called T-KT
joaopaulofoo,inFAMOUSwasser,Who turned connie's mother into a titan?
inFAMOUSwasser,thewingidingi,prob zeke
thewingidingi,AustinKunTV,It was absolutely Zeke
inFAMOUSwasser,truthfullynegative,Jeeku
truthfullynegative,inFAMOUSwasser,"Lol thanks for the reply

To me 2.5 years later"
joaopaulofoo,Dovazul_,"Yo a lot of time has passed in this last episode, Eren only has like 6-7 years left üò∂"
Dovazul_,MysticEden,But at the same time if he wasn‚Äôt a titan he would have been killed a long time ago.
MysticEden,Dovazul_,Foreal foreal
joaopaulofoo,velariumm,Even though this happened a long way back but any one else find it ironic that grisha's old wife came back and killed his new wife. I guess revenge for cheating lol
velariumm,CrannyTTV,"It‚Äôs not cheating if she got turned into a titan , he had to move on"
CrannyTTV,lightmonkey,It's not cheating if you do it for FREEDOM.
velariumm,MysticEden,I wondered that too. Did she somehow know?
joaopaulofoo,some-canadian-kid,Can we just talk about how Armin‚Äôs looks way better grow out.
joaopaulofoo,GioMike,"the credits showing parts of season 4 are amazing, paired with that soundtrack too."
joaopaulofoo,migs97,"Thus ends possibly the greatest season of the show.

I can‚Äôt believe that there‚Äôs only one season left. It‚Äôs been a long, amazing ride, folks."
joaopaulofoo,snowskyflake97,"I am deeply angered by the lack of comments people are giving towards Mikasa's really cute moment with Armin at the end of the episode. COME ON PEOPLE WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT THIS MORE.   
P.S. I ain't shipping MikasaxArmin, I'm just saying Mikasa looked really cute in there coupled with that little sound she made as she stepped on the water."
snowskyflake97,nx85,They were briefly kids again. It was beautiful.
joaopaulofoo,contrarian01,"Can someone tell me what the hell happened to like the conceivably thousands of titans outside the walls? Every time the scouts returned from a mission, they would be decimated going outside the walls.

I think Levi makes some throw away line about clearing them out of Wall Maria, but weren't we always led to believe there were tons of them beyond the walls? Does the manga explain this more? It kinda ruined the finale for me as I didn't understand how they were able to travel so freely to the sea.

Also, can someone explain the internal struggle Eren was having with Historia? I didn't get that at all."
contrarian01,AustinKunTV,"When the holes were opened into Shinganshina and wall Maria, all of the Titans outside of the walls made their way into wall Maria.

Eren first used his hardening ability to build the Titan guillotine contraption, and they used that to easily lure and kill all of the remaining Titans. It explains this in the episode and shows imagery. They didn't have to fight anymore Titans because they killed them all with the guillotine.

Eren had a memory from touching Historia, of his father begging and pleading them to return the memories to the people. Eren was tricked by Rod Reiss to believe his father simply stormed in and killed the Reiss family, but he was given a look into how it really happened. His father didn't want to kill or eat anyone, he just wanted the people freed. I'm also assuming he saw something else we didn't and we won't know until next season."
AustinKunTV,contrarian01,"I've gotten the gist of why there were no titans outside of the wall. I got that down.

What I was referring to with Historia and Eren was that big where Eren didn't want to say anything when he was in that military meeting because they didn't want them to experiment on Historia or something? That I still don't get."
contrarian01,ak190,??? Maybe you should watch the ep again bc these are such simple points here my friend
ak190,contrarian01,Thanks
contrarian01,MarcelSSJ4,With the lack of titans in the outside I‚Äôm just gonna listen to what Levi said but Eren said last episode that when he comes in contact with royal blood he his linked up with certain memories and powers. History is royal blood. Something like thatüòÖ
contrarian01,pavloviandogg,"There was a time gap between the beginning of the episode and the beach scene. Basically, they spent a certain amount of time having Eren in his Titan form and the other scouts killing what titans were left in Shinganshina, where most of the Titans from outside the walls filtered into once Wall Maria fell. I think this was more explicit in the manga.

As for the number of Titans outside the walls, that depends on whether a bunch of people have been dumped on the island by Marley recently. The government inside the walls made it sound like the whole world was overrun by Titans, not whatever political prisoners were ‚Äúsent to Paradise‚Äù in the last hundred years. There may have at one point been more Titans on the island, but the Scouts have slowly been picking them off over the course of decades, and Marley hasn‚Äôt been sending that many people to the island lately for reasons that will be explained in the next season."
joaopaulofoo,darkaznf0b,Well season 4 will happen... The ending tho...
darkaznf0b,Hyusrar,Season 4 is announced for Fall 2020. Teaser can be found at shingeki.tv
Hyusrar,Haengeklumpen,they will cut it in half again.
Hyusrar,goldefish,I can't understand the trailer. Could you help me out with the meaning?
joaopaulofoo,regentsleet,I lasted long enough. Onto the manga!
joaopaulofoo,nx85,"Armin realized his dream. Mikasa finally smiled. That was so f*cking beautiful, however short lived. When they saw the crawling titan, that was so sad too. A fellow patriot."
joaopaulofoo,nyarlathotepisyummy,This episode was fucking beautiful. What a perfect way to end the season.
joaopaulofoo,thegiodude,"What an absolute masterpiece. This season shines through, but the reveal of all the secrets of their world was not dissatisfying; It did not take away from the magnificence of the story as a whole at all. It did not make the story any less compelling and the secrets were not uninteresting. 

Two notes, I do not agree with Floch's assessment about Eren and Mikasa, and how Erwin deserved to be saved over Armin, at all. For one, Eren was not always sure of himself, he had a lot of doubts after he learned about the Reis family. In fact he was willing to sacrifice himself right away for his perceived greater good. So Floch can suck it. 

Secondly, I wonder how Eren's discovery about the method to use the founding titan's powers will affect the story now. He has not told anyone of that information yet."
joaopaulofoo,Donrage,Jesus Christ Annie has been in her shell for 6 damn years?!?! WTF?!?
Donrage,Chameni_Psychi,"Nope, only a year. She and Eren didn‚Äôt fight until after the fall of Trost which was 1 year ago. It‚Äôs been 6 years since the Colossal Titan first appears, then a 5 year gap for them to grow up and become cadets."
joaopaulofoo,some-canadian-kid,"Time to summon the will power not to read the manga.

Edit: nvm fuck it. Just saw the season 4 teaser. So do any of y‚Äôall know where to pick up in the manga?"
joaopaulofoo,tarek1414,"I feel so soo bad for eren,the shit that he went through would break anyone,but he has no choice but to keep going and all the weight on his shoulders is torturing him,poor Eren,he can never catch a break."
joaopaulofoo,MordorfTheSenile,"Maybe this will all be answered in Season 4, but I find Zeke to be the only major unanswered question. He clearly rejected the Eldian way and wanted nothing to do with what his parents were trying to teach him....yet he is carrying out the wishes of the Marleyans as a titan? And one of the founding titans at that. Whats his endgame in all of this?"
MordorfTheSenile,nx85,Probably the same as the other Marley titans. He was brainwashed as a child and given the power

BOTSwagLoAF,some-canadian-kid,I think it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúT-KT‚Äù by Hiroyuki sawano.
joaopaulofoo,Donn_ok,"This is attack on Titans beach episode , now it is a true anime."
joaopaulofoo,LittleMidgetMan,Honestly this season was worth waiting for
joaopaulofoo,StaticSh0T,"This season had literally everything. Amazing season and beautiful last episode. Honestly, didn't know how amazing this show was going to be when I first watched season 1 wayyy back"
joaopaulofoo,MrLuck31,What chapter does the manga pick up on?

JadeSerpant,MarcelSSJ4,I like how you just told him to be strong

joaopaulofoo,Pokemoncrusher1,Hy did eren suddenly look so weird
Pokemoncrusher1,chicano1406,He‚Äôs aging fast asf
joaopaulofoo,Nobz4lyf,Nice beach episode.
joaopaulofoo,TopLadChad,"I've got one question, when Eren kissed Historias arm he saw his father memorize right. But hasn't he seen them already? Or am I forgetting something?"
joaopaulofoo,Hamlet_271,i cant wait to start reading the manga. anyone has any beginner guides as to how to read em
Hamlet_271,MysticEden,Well you could read ‚Äúbefore the attack‚Äù first and then go into the main series. There‚Äôs also the one on Levi‚Äôs past in the underground. but it‚Äôs not as well written honestly...
joaopaulofoo,napes22,"One thing that has me confused, is that I thought whoever held the power of the titan took on its personality.  In the case of the Reiss family, it was the foundling titan (or the king) who always wanted to avoid conflict.  The Attack Titan always wanted to rebel and break free, which we see in Eren.

Why isn't he impacted by the Founding titan's ""personalty""?"
napes22,jayzen355,"I think it takes having royal blood for the founding Titan‚Äôs curse to kick in.

I doubt the first king ever thought anyone would ever dare to steal the power from their bloodline."
napes22,redokonogi,"You may notice that Eren doesn‚Äôt have those crazy crystal-looking eyes. So going by that, and the fact that he‚Äôs not royal blood, he isn‚Äôt affected by the King‚Äôs ideals."
redokonogi,napes22,Makes sense. I completely forgot it has to do with the Royal Blood!
joaopaulofoo,Ardbark7471,Yeah I don‚Äôt think I can wait a year
joaopaulofoo,ArminSeesTheSeas,"What an amazing experience this season has been. I‚Äôve had a great time coming to this reddit after each episode to read theories and piece things together.

I have one MAJOR question that I haven‚Äôt seen anybody else talk about, regarding the opening scene of the episode. After Grisha said ‚Äú to save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else‚Äù  it cut briefly to that scene of EMA, sitting atop the wall above the sea, looking at the book. Is this supposed to mean that there is an alternate time line where they all experienced life by the sea when they were children? Or am I completely misreading this?
 
Anime only strong until next year"
ArminSeesTheSeas,MysticEden,In the memory they were by water but not the sea.
joaopaulofoo,positiveflower,I found myself struggling to understand this entire season until I just learned I completely skipped over all the season 3 **part 1** episodes. FML. Decided I will just rewatch everything starting from season 1. We have a year to kill may as well.
positiveflower,ANTI-aliasing,F
joaopaulofoo,mrspookyman1031,The ending was quite rewarding yet it also wasent to see them accomplish their one goal only to realise they were surrounded by enemies didnt sit right with me
joaopaulofoo,TheCrowGrandfather,"Man red head guy (Floch) had all the points.

Armin shouldn't have been chosen. They all let emotions get the best of them. They were selfish to pick Armin instead of Erwin"
TheCrowGrandfather,itrv1,"It would have been selfish to drag erwin back to this hell, and you're forgetting just how many spots armins plans saved the day. Erwin stood on a mountain of corpses not for humanity, but for his own desires of knowing the truth."
TheCrowGrandfather,AustinKunTV,"Levi already explained why he made his decision. Also, judging by the internal turmoil before he gave the injection, he realized that Erwin's dreams ended at the basement, while Armins extended far beyond the walls. Not only that, but Levi flashed back to how he convinced Erwin to die then and there, and give up his dreams. Erwin smiled and found peace in his death, and Levi realized bringing him back was the wrong decision to make."
TheCrowGrandfather,ekulpotamus,"What I find weird is that nobody is talking about how Erwin with his last strength, literally slapped away Levi's hand with the serum right before he was going to inject him! Did nobody else notice this? Or did they not care and just wanted to being him back against his will??"
ekulpotamus,ThatGaymer,"It was more of a spasm he had. He was dreaming/hallucinating he was in his class, and was raising his hand to ask his father the question about how could people know that everyone outside the walls died."
joaopaulofoo,Marcellus97,Eren has a maximum of 7 years left to live.
Marcellus97,haveanicedayfuckyou,Just realized Mikasa will live most of her life alone cuz she will lose eren and armin soon :(
haveanicedayfuckyou,fujianmian,Bruh.
joaopaulofoo,WhereisAlexGulikers,I is excited.
R4_F,MysticEden,"Hum but there are some minor differences in the manga and some additional info. Nothing major sure, but I usually read the manga of the season I just watched while waiting for the next one. Overall it is close but not exactly the same. 80-90% ish"
joaopaulofoo,Disco_Fighter,Season 4 confirmation brought good news as well as a bad news.....I thought AOT would be a 7-8 season long saga because of its success worldwide. Season 3 just ended and I'm feeling very sadüòî
Disco_Fighter,zerofantasia,Just think that a good story must finish when it has to be finished
zerofantasia,Disco_Fighter,Yes.....its a bitter truth that we need to accept
joaopaulofoo,shibafrien,"I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to be able to wait until 2020. This anime has my entire heart. 

Anyone got suggestions for other animes to fill the void for the next year? LMAO"
shibafrien,Ded_Pul,Gintama kek
joaopaulofoo,chocomilkluv,"Okay this is going to be a stupid question but i‚Äôm slow and still don‚Äôt understand it all completely... so is everyone who lives within the walls eldian? Also what are the beast titan, armored titan and colossal titan fighting for? To help the people within the walls regain their knowledge of the past?"
chocomilkluv,nx85,"Yes, everyone within the walls is Eldian.

Beast, Armored and Colossal titans (original bearers of them) were not fighting to help the people within the walls. They were there to kill them and destroy the cities so that Marley could come in and harvest the oil that's on the island. They are Eldians that were brainwashed and trained by Marley."
joaopaulofoo,Mrchair734,Neat-o
joaopaulofoo,Matheusj99,It's criminal that they're didn't play the ending. I wanted it so bad
joaopaulofoo,TheLastHeroes,What a beautiful fucking show.
joaopaulofoo,napes22,I'm a little confused as to how all the Titans are gone now. Did Marley stop turning Eldians and setting them free? They also said something about the Titans in the walls are gone - were there that many living Titans in the walls?
joaopaulofoo,Hamlet_271,When Eren first used his power did he touch his dad's ex wife who was of a royal bloodline?
Hamlet_271,WindyCityAssasin2,Yes
Hamlet_271,AustinKunTV,"Dude, you should rewatch the past 2 episodes. It's mentioned around 2-3 times."
joaopaulofoo,ashai1994,"**Too many positive comments; Getting tired of scrolling lol.** 

**Great season but is there anyone that DID NOT like it? just curious ???**"
ashai1994,jayzen355,I kept waiting for a crazy cliffhanger. First time I was disappointed.
ashai1994,WindyCityAssasin2,"Im personally more of a happily-ever-after kinda person and based off the way the series is going doesnt look like I'll get that.  The problem for them to overcome just became so much more complex this season. Dont get me wrong, this is easily one of the best shows I've ever seen (and it obviously isnt over yet) but my soft heart needs a happy ending and i dont think imma get it"
joaopaulofoo,SoggyNoodles719,Can someone please tell me what chapter the manga picks up at after the newest season
SoggyNoodles719,furiousfotog,I believe this episode is chapter 90
joaopaulofoo,Paint__,"The memories of people being injected with spinal fluid and turning into titans was on the larger island Marley, right? But apparently the walls are on Paradise, where the story mostly takes place. Is there an identical sea port on both islands?"
Paint__,furiousfotog,No. It‚Äôs all on Paradis. The marleans bring people over the sea to the island then make them Titans there.
joaopaulofoo,postcardmap45,Did I miss something? Why did they only find one Titan beyond the walls? Did they stop making Titans after Eren‚Äôs dad got turned?
postcardmap45,redokonogi,They‚Äôre not exactly making titans on a daily basis. So they‚Äôll stop for a while and then make another batch of titans if needed. It‚Äôs just that the amount of titans have accumulated over the years.
joaopaulofoo,Meb4u,I'm confused about something. So did they kill all the Titans that were outside the walls? I remember one of the characters saying it took a year. Is Paradise island now free of Titans except for within the walls themselves?
Meb4u,syaami,"Hange had predicted that most of the titans had entered wall maria. And they killed most of them.  Levi talks about it as they are riding towards the sea. [Link One.](https://i.imgur.com/i8PsPri.png) [Link Two.](https://i.imgur.com/J9QlAZp.png)  

Since the Marley gov turns Eldian criminals into Pure titans as punishment, the titans that were outside the walls accumulated over many years. So unless the Marley gov is creating more titans, there won't be many outside the walls in Paradis island."
joaopaulofoo,depicc,"I have a question, why weren't more eldians being turned to titans? why was noone there?"
joaopaulofoo,Shawn_Spenstar,Question not totally related to this episode but if anyone could answer I would appreciate it. Are there pure Titans roaming around the mainland where the country Marley is? Or are the only pure Titans the ones on the Paradise island? Since it seems the majority of the pure Titans on Paradise island were said to have been wiped out this episode I'm just wondering if there are still tons of hordes of Titans roaming around or if Marley and the other human countries wiped them out.
Shawn_Spenstar,nx85,"Pure titans are all on Paradise Island. They are all exiled Eldians, originally from Marley."
nx85,Shawn_Spenstar,Ok so since the vast majority of pure Titans have been wiped out does that mean the value of founding titan has dropped dramatically since there aren't many Titans for them to command and send at Marley? Or are the Titans in the walls part of the threat?
joaopaulofoo,Sir_I_Exist,How did Krueger have memories of Mikasa and Armin??????
Sir_I_Exist,zerofantasia,Time is distorted in lordran
Sir_I_Exist,nx85,Because all Eldians' consciousnesses intersect at the coordinate.
joaopaulofoo,The_Good_Mortt,"Alright so I got a question, I'm not sure if I missed this or if I'm just dumb and don't understand. Why did Zeke betray Grisha? Is it because Grisha pushed his beliefs on him and Zeke hated him for it, like Grisha hated his dad?"
The_Good_Mortt,syaami,">Zeke Jaeger was born to [Grisha Jaeger](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Grisha_Jaeger_(Anime)) and [Dina Fritz](https://attackontitan.fandom.com/wiki/Dina_Fritz_(Anime)), Restorationists who¬†were planning to overthrow the Marley government and put the Eldians back in power. When the Marley government announced the Warrior program, asking for Eldian children between the ages of five to seven to serve as potential Warriors, Grisha decided to enroll¬†Zeke into the program for the latter to infiltrate the Marleyan military as a spy for the Restorationists.¬†Zeke was subjected to intense indoctrination to the Restorationists' rhetoric by his parents while simultaneouly taught to obey Marley's teachings to earn their trust; such contradictory instructions proved to be too much for young Zeke to handle and cracking under the pressure and the stress, he turned his own parents in to Marley's¬†government.

momu1990,__irrelephant__,"It is true, it will be the final season The manga is apparently also in its final arc."
joaopaulofoo,IMKudaimi123,"It‚Äôs underrated but Mikasa throughout this season for those who hated on her showed she wasn‚Äôt all about only killing anyone who threatened Eren , and that she cares about others too and is the best character along with Levi"
joaopaulofoo,Ki_rill,"All season of anime was ok,but I think that second half of it was better.Better opening,plot twists and more things.I was really sad when Armin ""died"".But...Berthold's head was clamped in Titan's mouth like a Nutcracker's  lmao.So  this season was epic,especially Mikasa badass moments.And what is your opinion about the whole season of this anime?"
joaopaulofoo,littlewitchlol,"The finally episode felt really bitter and sad, when looking at the sea and the beginning of Eren's insanity.

Ever thought of something that you think was always true, but turns out to be a complete lie? Just like what Eren felt when saying freedom on the other side of the sea T_T made me tears.

God damn ISAYAMA and WIT STUDIO, the tears in this episode!!"
joaopaulofoo,IMKudaimi123,"This season was amazing. Mikasa and Levi continue to be the best characters, but also Eren developed very well through out the season as well, and plenty of amazing action. Season 4 is going to be even better."
joaopaulofoo,Protanope,"I watched the first half of season 1 all the way back when it came out but didn't catch up on the rest until just a few weeks ago and hoo boy it's been an insane ride. I honestly didn't really like the last two episodes with such huge exposition dumps because there's no real reason to care about any of the people across the sea. I always really loved that the titans were the main enemy and now I guess it's shifting to other people, but the show has been really solid so far so I can only hope that the final season will do it all justice."
joaopaulofoo,MadFlava76,"I'm so happy all the anime watchers who haven't been spoiled by the manga have reached this point. When I got to this point in the manga, my mind was blown away. It's kind of awesome to see it all animated and in color."

Or his goofy face from the Sudden Visitor OVA when Jean gets mad at Connie and Sasha for stealing his kills in the Trost training mission and they both strike goofy fighting poses.

Or his goofy fighting pose from S1E4 during hand to hand combat training.

Or him laughing at his own ""eavesdropping"" pun in S3E16.

Definitely this one. It was right before she took out her father. And shes the one who decided to do it herself. She knew that if she was the one to do it, it would strengthen the cities faith in having a new ruler. It was her own father but she did it with barely any hesitation and that shows a lot of strength within her character.

HunzSenpai,BucktacularBardlock,"It was for me. Just now.

What a day to have eyes."
MisplacedxLightbulb,commander_wong,"My complaints kind of extends just beyond the ending itself, but the also leadup to it

A) Eren not regress his character and being ""an idiot"". Like I get what Isayama was going with, but I just don't like it. Ultimately a character with clear goals and motivations is more captivating than characters that don't know what they're doing

B) The Ymir thing. I thought the Ymir characterization was ok. It was kind of clear that she was like that when she protected Fritz from the spear. I thought her regrets on not letting him die and imaginary hugging her daughters was nice, touching even.

What I didn't like was how this was the key to stopping all Titans out of nowhere and for some reason Mikasa was the key to everything despite having very little similarities to Ymir's situation. There was just no setup, didn't make much sense and wasn't a satisfying answer

C) Time paradoxes. As cool as the ""sending visions to the past"" has been in some moments, it ultimately added nothing to the story as a whole. I felt it made a lot of character motivations convoluted when it didn't need to be, and made characters feel like they have no agency over their own actions. Like Grisha making Eren a Titan after begging Zeke to stop him, or Eren sending Dina to eat his mom

D) Alliance motivations. From our POV, it's easy to say ""genocide is wrong"". But from the characters in question, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Outside of Jean and maybe Armin, the rest of Eren's friends aren't exactly altruistic people. I feel Isayama never developed a good reason for why they would go out of their way to stop Eren

E) Characterization changes. On that note, I feel a lot of characters have been made to support stopping the Rumbling when they probably wouldn't. Most of the dead Scouts probably wouldn't mind the Rumbling happening, Erwin included. Kruger especially shouldn't be against the Rumbling. 

I feel Isayama also made the outside world a lot more tolerable as the Rumbling is happening and did the inverse with Paradis citizens, which I felt is doing too much to make the readers/watchers feel bad about what Eren is doing

F) Plot armor. Kind of a minor complaint, but the Alliance members' plot armor in the final battle is just off the charts. Comparing the beginning of the series to what they are doing now feels like two different universes

G) Historia. She did nothing post timeskip. Her parallels to Ymir wasn't important. Her pregnancy, which was brought up quite a bit, didn't really lead anywhere. 

H) Armin x Annie. Also kind of minor, but this is maybe the worst romance I've ever read. Some defenders of this ship will pretend this was ""foreshadowed"" when Annie didn't kill Armin as the Female Titan, which is probably the lowest bar for a romance I've ever heard"
commander_wong,Drakob-Hitsimari,"Honestly, I don't understand how Mikasa freed Ymir, because that's basically what Eren did in the paths. He freed her from having to obey the king, so wtf did Mikasa do to free her? It just doesn't make much sense."
Drakob-Hitsimari,Kiltmanenator,"Watch this. I was very lukewarm on Ymir's centrality but this video turned me around on it entirely. The pieces are all there, but I don't think the show did a good job emphasizing or explaining them. But they are there. 

https://youtu.be/HQ3uHh9OGAw?si=hvBo2G9JjaQOP_pp"
Drakob-Hitsimari,SpaceHairLady,Eren allowed her to feel anger. Mikasa allowed to her feel the love alongside the anger and to feel closure which released her from the guilt she had for obeying him all those years.
commander_wong,New-Monarchy,"Hijacking the top comment here to add a couple more quick things. I completely agree with you! But I just wanted to add some points that aren‚Äôt limited to the finale, but are all still technically towards the ‚Äúend‚Äù of the story:

1. I straight up dislike the ‚ÄúPride‚Äù episode (4x24). I thought that episode was a good opportunity to flesh out both Annie and Connie, and it kinda dropped the ball for both because it needed to rush through so much so fast. It would've worked 1000x better if it was split into two episodes. One for finding and fleshing out Annie/Connie, and one for forming the alliance. I think it‚Äôs probably the lowest low for the entire series for me.

2. I would extend the plot armor complaint to the Jeagerist fight by the port too. Not AS bad as the finale fight, but still a little unbelievable given what we‚Äôve seen in battles before.

3. Pacing. Once the actual rumbling starts, the story‚Äôs pacing is just too quick. I understand that Isayama was under a lot of pressure to finish up the manga, but there were just so many things that needed more time to flesh out. It started off as nitpicks here and there, but by the time the finale comes, I have legitimate issues with just how QUICKLY some of the plot threads are resolved, on top of the issues listed above and by the comment I‚Äôm responding to."
New-Monarchy,M1x1ma,"I agree with you on the plot armor. I was frustrated in seasons 3 and 4 when the main characters held back on killing people and they got away over and over again. 

I also thought the decisions at the end weren't in their nature, like in seasons 1 and 2 they were pretty open with eachother and would talk everything through beforehand. In the last season Eren leaves them and is making all these rash decisions, the Islanders want to do the rumbling and defend Eren to do so, and then think it's too far and stop him. Everyone is blaming Erin for Sasha's death even though it was totally unconnected to him in a mission they all signed up for. 

Overall though I cried a ton at the end and thought it was an amazing series."
commander_wong,random1211312,"I agree with most of this. However I think A was just a bit too subtle in what it was about. Eren's always been a childish and irrational character. That's part of what made his ""switch"" to the stoic badass bitch so shocking. But in reality the act falling apart at the end makes sense. That being said, I do think it would've been better if they hinted at that a bit more and structured it in a more logical way.

I also disagree on C a bit. Again, it could've been handled better, but I do think it adds to things more. My only complaint is that a lot of the actions taken weren't left with enough of a question for it to be anything but ""Woah that's crazy"". For example Grisha killing the Reice family. It's very easy to say he did it for his own reasons. But they added in the Eren bit, which while shocking, and chilling for what Eren's willing to do as well as Zeke's development, added nothing to that moment itself. In fact it would've been more terrifying to see Eren redirecting the smiling titan to his mom instead.

Everything else I either completely agree with or what I disagree with is so minor it's not worth noting"
commander_wong,Steiner-Gate,"I.Just adding more to these. The Hallucinogenia is a whole separate being and it just disappeared after Eren died. It could have easily found a new host. For example the scared soldiers of Fort Salta. 
J. Eren killing his own mom creates more plot holes than it fixes anything. And his reasoning was to save Bert and make the plot as accurate to current as possible

K. The Rumbling should not have ended when Zeke died(Btw Zeke's anticlimactic death is a whole can of BS after a Talk no Jutsu from Armin) We have seen earlier in S2 ending that Eren controlled Pure Titans even after that initial touch from Dina. 

L. Many of the characters we know became Pure Titans and within 10 minutes they are back to normal. In short there were no casualties in the Alliance battle."
Steiner-Gate,Complex37,Zeke‚Äôs change of character wasn‚Äôt just from his talk with Armin. In 4x20 Grisha apologized to Zeke and told him that he needed to stop Eren. On top of that he was in paths for a very long time
Steiner-Gate,BigBambuMeekLou,"I assumed Eren didn‚Äôt need Zeke anymore I thought that was the whole point of him joining Ymir lol, I was confused that Eren couldn‚Äôt continue the wall titans after Zeke‚Äôs death. Maybe he was just faking it to sell them as the heroes. Because he could still transform into that colossal form somehow afterwards"
commander_wong,DrHandBanana,"Any actual solutions or just a list of the issues you had? I'm genuinely interested, these are good points"
commander_wong,WedMuffin123,"Amazing points.. like they all realistically would have died at the end

Annie and armin ‚Äîwas so random

Biggest fumble was the Ymir story line"
commander_wong,BigBambuMeekLou,"I agree with point A, I didn‚Äôt really like the anime‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an idiot‚Äù line I thought that dumbed down Eren more than necessary lol"
commander_wong,Ceaer_Reddit,"To reply to the first point, and this is a relatively common criticism so I'm not sure if people are missing something, but Eren's motivations are clearly laid out, though some if it may need a look back which people may not remember. content he admits in the first special (Chapter 131 for manga) when talking to Ramzi ""When I found out humanity lived beyond the walls. I was so disappointed. I wanted to destroy it all"" and in special 2 (Chapter 139). ""If you guys hadn't stopped me, I would've flattened the world"" or something to that effect. Eren calling himself an idiot is own self justification. Even before season 4, he blames himself for everything bad that happens to people."
commander_wong,zbox2345,"Definitely some valid complaints here that I totally get.  I‚Äôm sorry for the long reply, and writing isn‚Äôt the easiest way to convey my thoughts, but if you care to read this, here you are. 

A) I can see where you‚Äôre coming from, but I disagree that Eren was a character without clear goals and motivations. The thing is that he has multiple motivations, some of which inhibit the other goals. This is not uncommon in the real world either. His four mains goals as I see them were 1) Get rid of the Titan curse.   2) See that scenery (create the unoccupied world that he saw in Armin‚Äôs book).   3) Protect his friends, and yes, I‚Äôm aware Hange and Sasha died as a result of his actions (this is where his other goals inhibit each other) plus, I think that as he saw it, this was the clearest path towards safety, as it was the future he saw in his memories. Fighting a war against the world was too uncertain for his taste. 4) Buy Paradis a reasonable amount of time. Finally, when Eren calls himself an idiot, much like the rest of the dialogue in the series, people take it at face value without applying context or trying to parse his words. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs saying that he‚Äôs stupid. He‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs an idiot in the sense that he couldn‚Äôt let go of his childish desire to see the world he wanted to see in Armin‚Äôs book. 

B) I don‚Äôt feel like there always needs to be an absurd amount of setup for every plot reveal. Sometimes, a plot reveal is meant to take you off guard a bit, but when you think about it, it fits well enough. Others have written good pieces on this https://x.com/cactuzz4nf/status/1721331822158618670?s=46&t=FinmjoOw7kwnyVV30b6joA

C) Frankly, I agree with you here to some degree, especially regarding Eren‚Äôs mother twist. As for Grisha, I‚Äôve seen people theorize that Eren showed him other memories later that convinced him to give Eren the Attack Titan. During the conversation with Zeke, it‚Äôs clear he didn‚Äôt know Carla had died. It‚Äôs possible knowledge of her death is what triggered a rage in him that made him give up the Titan to Eren. Ultimately, there are times where a writer chooses to allow some ambiguities that can reasonably be filled in by a viewer for the sake of story pace. That is not the case with Eren‚Äôs mom, which is why I dislike it a bit. 


D) I fundamentally disagree here. I think this is one of the most well developed and predictable outcomes of the series. To talk about this, I have to begin with the Jaegirists.  Although I disagree with them, I understand where they‚Äôre coming from. To them, the world is a faceless monster that wishes them dead, so why shouldn‚Äôt they respond in kind? In contrast, our scouts have crossed the sea, lived with the people across the sea, and have become aware that the outside world is not so different than theirs. Most of the outside world is innocent. As Hange said, they‚Äôre no longer ignorant island devils. They can‚Äôt just sit back and let Eren trample over people without discrimination. It would be impossible for them to enjoy the ‚Äúpeace‚Äù, however brief that ‚Äúpeace‚Äù may be, knowing that it was built upon the lives of BILLIONS OF INNOCENTS. They‚Äôve been victims and witnesses of indiscriminate murder, at the hands of pure titans, since the very first season. How can they idly watch as it happens on a planetary scale? I think this is why Onyankapon was so frustrated by the Jaegerists at his execution. He was frustrated that none of them could understand the insanity of indiscriminate murder, despite their own experiences with it since the fall of Shiganshina. 

In the end, it all circles back to dialogue from both Armin and Levi from the first season. When the female Titan is attacking, Levi tells Eren ‚ÄúYou can never know for sure what the right choice is in the moment; you have to make the choice you believe you‚Äôll regret the least.‚Äù Every character in the alliance, as well as Floch himself are doing just that. 

Armin‚Äôs speech about who people perceive as a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù applies more to us as an audience. A lot of people can become blinded by emotion or personal investment for one side or the other, which narrows their perspective. So many support the Jaegerists without even trying to understand where the Alliance is coming from. Same goes for blind supporters of the alliance who dismiss every action the Jaegerists take. I think this lack of perspective can hamper someone‚Äôs experience. If you‚Äôre ridiculously biased toward either side, you may find yourself loving or hating the show for the wrong reasons. To me it‚Äôs a harrowing story, where every character involved has been put in an impossible situation where the stakes have never been higher. My own views fall in line with Alliance, so I root for them, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt understand Floch and company. 

E) Again, I think you are misunderstanding the characters. I understand that Erwin is capable of making hard decisions, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs without any moral fiber at all. His entire goal was to prove that humanity existed outside the walls. Do you honestly believe he‚Äôd be down for INDISCRIMINATE global genocide? I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that crazy to think that he would oppose it. As for Kruger, how is him opposing the rumbling unbelievable? He‚Äôs from Liberio, which is in the path of it. 

F) Off the chart plot armor seems a little extreme. Can you give some examples? Obviously, their skills improved significantly since season 1, so yes, what they‚Äôre doing now will be more impressive. 


G) Parallels can be set up between multiple characters. It doesn‚Äôt always have to directly lead somewhere. The point of her pregnancy was plot related. She had to become pregnant to avoid being fed Zeke. Plus, her baby is the first born into a world without titans.

H) This one seems more like a personal gripe. I thought there was sufficient setup. Romantic setup can be subtle; it doesn‚Äôt have to be overt. Armin and Annie‚Äôs ties have been evident since season one, at least to me."
commander_wong,NightShadow2001,"So, after reading your comment, it seems to me that a lot of your dislike towards it seems to be misunderstanding. You may as well dislike it even if you understood it, which is still valid, but your argument now is pretty baseless. I hope you don‚Äôt take this as an attack against you because I‚Äôm simply here to have a good debate.

A) That‚Äôs the point. Life isn‚Äôt like a movie and the good guy isn‚Äôt always going to do everything perfectly. Eren was and always has been an idiot. We got the idea that maybe he changed but that got proven wrong when he explained that everything was so Ymir could get what she wants. He only did what he did because of two things: Ymir wanted him to and he saw the future, knowing exactly what will happen, and regardless what he chooses to do, it will happen. He cannot change it. So he feels like an idiot to not be able to figure out a way to change the outcome.

B) I agree that Ymir‚Äôs characterisation was pretty stale - we didn‚Äôt really learn much about her and I definitely would‚Äôve liked to know more about her, the Titan worm and what she learned about it after 2000 years of knowing it. However, I like to believe the ambiguity played a role in the story, but that may just be me giving credit where none is due.

C) The timeskips weren‚Äôt pointless. Every one of them brought key insights into how it was going to end. And the character motivations weren‚Äôt ‚Äúconvoluted‚Äù, they were simply not shown accurately before. Zeke‚Äôs plan was always to use the Founding Titan‚Äôs power to euthanise all Eldians and Eren‚Äôs plan was always to follow Ymir‚Äôs orders and bring about the end of the curse of titans. Zeke‚Äôs wanted to bring an end to it too, but Eren‚Äôs was less barbaric. The only argument I have for it is that Eren could‚Äôve tried to explain it to Zeke, but then again, Eren knows what happens in the future. It‚Äôs kind of like having hindsight in things that haven‚Äôt happened yet. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he could‚Äôve explained it to Zeke, point is, he doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the way it is in the future.

D) The Alliance members aren‚Äôt altruistic but they have shown great disdain from killing humans. They‚Äôre consistently dehumanising whatever enemy they want to kill, like Titans for the Eldians or Eldians for the Marleyans, in order to justify the killing. They‚Äôre against killing those that are equal as a whole, though. Tbh e motivations are pretty clear. When listening to the plan about the rumbling, they were all silent at first. After having thought about it, they realised, killing 100% of the world for the Eldians will not solve anything and will just be genocide for the sake of the few. 

E) If you think Erwin would‚Äôve been in support of the rumbling, I think you need to rewatch the show. Erwin, by far, is the soldier that will easily put aside his personal emotions and vendetta for the sake of humanity. Eren‚Äôs choice with the rumbling is personally and emotionally motivated. Erwin would‚Äôve been against it. When it comes to Eren Kruger, I‚Äôm sure he wouldn‚Äôt have cared because he knows what happens in the future. Nothing he can do can change it.

F) You did mention it was a minor complaint, but wtf do you expect lmfao. I would argue it was plot armour for Armin to be scorched that hard against Bertholdt and still be able to hold on for as long as he did. I think it‚Äôs plot armour that Levi decided to bring Armin back. 

G) Historia‚Äôs entire characterisation was to distance herself from being the descendent of Fritz. She didn‚Äôt want any of it and just wanted a normal life. She lived it. Eren made sure to keep her out of it as much as he could.

H) Tbh I believe this is valid. They did hint towards it quite a lot, but I believed Armin kept going to Annie because he had a part of Bertholdt in him. It didn‚Äôt quite stick to me that they were in love until they explicitly said. That being said, just poor execution. Not necessarily a bad pairing. Though I did have a feeling Armin was gay but oh well."
commander_wong,KookyAssociate3825,You seem to be missing the fact that Eren is not free and this is a deterministic reality.
KookyAssociate3825,DaRandomRhino,"But that still ignores that the early parts of the series before the timeskip and certainly up to the sea was centered around far more standard tropes that aren't determinism.

The broken gear, Mikasa nearly dying while Eren was full berserk and right before he showed up, etc.

Once determinism is thrown into the mix as late as it was, it hamstrings plot and motivations so much. It's no longer Eren seeing his mother killed, it's a determined event. Once he gets future memories he no longer makes choices, he hits the play button. Him going to Marley in secret to see how they live and treat Eldians doesn't matter, because he was already on autopilot from the moment he touched Historian's hand and that had already happened to him potentially.

The Paths are a great idea, his Titan sending memories backwards neat, his motivation being to see his people and his family free to the exclusion of everything else in his mind, neat. Every single bit of it comes tumbling down as soon as they are introduced together and makes the buildup to it largely meaningless. 

You could start the series near the end and have an actual deterministic story play out convincingly. But the start and end are written with completely different motivations from Isayama. 

It may be because the timeskips just sorta happen. The titans suddenly no longer being a threat in any way, shape, or form to force the threat be Marley, the rest of the world, then ending with Eren in almost no time at all for the audience and their perception of in-universe time being inconsistent."
commander_wong,Opposite-Constant329,"I respect a lot of these critiques. I hope that I can clear up why I think the Alliances motivations do have good justification. 

One of the biggest things is that everyone in the Alliance besides Levi and Hange spent that night with Ramsi‚Äôs family. This group understands better than anyone else in Paradis that there are plenty of people in the world that are either being oppressed by Marley as well, or have nothing to do with the conflict. These guys have bonded with ‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù more the anyone else. Especially given the fact that they grew up as soldiers with Reiner, Bert and Annie. One of the big themes of AOT is that it‚Äôs easy to assign evil intentions or kill people who you‚Äôve never even tried to sit down and talk to. All of Eren‚Äôs friends have experienced dining with the outside world and know that there are people that inarguably don‚Äôt deserve to be killed just for living outside the walls. 

I‚Äôm not sure if you think that Levi‚Äôs motivations are unclear but I feel if anyone lacks justification for helping paradis carry out a genocide it‚Äôs Levi Ackerman. Levi grew up oppressed by Paradisians. Not only was he essentially confined to an underground ghetto, but Paradis had actively been carrying out their own genocide that people tend to forget. The Ackerman were systematically being hunted down sponsored by the royal family as they were uncontrollable due to their immunity to the founder. Then Levi is essentially forcibly drafted into their military, and when he eventually turns it into his family, he is regularly spat at by the average paradis citizen when the scouts returned from failed missions. Then after all of this Floch the leader of the Yeagerists attempts to execute him while he was mortally wounded trying to carry out his final mission in killing Zeke. 

I think in all Levi understands that the world government wants him dead because he is from Paradis, and now confirmed extra by Floch‚Äôs betray, he has been wanted dead by the Eldian‚Äôs for his immunity to be controlled by the founder. Helping one of these powers commit genocide does nothing for him."
commander_wong,36Gig,"For Mikasa being the key, all Yimir needed to see was someone going against the one they loved without betraying that love. 

For time paradoxes. If you know the actions someone will take you can make a prediction of their next action, aka 1+1 the next action is 2. Yimir has access to all memories of her descendents. This is also why the attack Titan was not really known about."
commander_wong,KittiesOnAcid,"I like the ending thematically, but I agree it's poorly told mostly because of F. The battle on Eren's back against all those powerful titans definitely feels like a completey different world compared to the threat of even a few normal titans in earlier seasons. Suspension of disbelief goes out the window. The pacing is also awful and ramps up way too quick. I kinda think we would've benefitted from knowing more about what's going on with Eren.

Ultimately, idek what to think. The show couldn't always stay the same as it was in Seasons 1-3, and I like the idea of Paradis and Marley. I like where the story goes, Eren's disillusionment with the real world, the reveal of the titans' true origin and the discrimination against Eldians, etc. I like the themes of the end for the most part. But the plot goes way too quickly to Eren being a genocidal maniac, the rest of the cast fighting against completely unbelievable odds, and Mikasa and Armin feeling so good about Eren at the end is a bit weird. It's nice that Armin shoulders a bit of the responsibility but also feels unrealistic to how someone would actually act there. And obviously Armin teaching Eren about the outside world does not even begin to justify Eren's viewpoint. 

It's weird, a bit all over the place, and feels like a different world from the rest of the story. At the same time, I cannot think of any way to do it better other than making it longer to fix pacing and flesh some stuff out."

bbbryce987,amcbain17,"Stfu, that‚Äôs how you interpreted it"
ComputerOk6247,jagault2011,"Eren killing his mom just makes me so upset. I understand the point of it narratively, but it does not sit well with me and cheapens the crux of his resolve."
ComputerOk6247,Ceaer_Reddit,"Eren didn't kill his mom, well he did, but it wasn't intentional. Eren caused Dina to skip on Bert because she was going to eat him, and Eren couldn't have that as he was important, but as a result she ate Carla."
Ceaer_Reddit,TingoMedia,"How did Eren manage to redirect the titan in that time period though? He's only able to manipulate the past through memories. At the time, Eren wasn't even the attack or founding titan yet, Grisha was. I'm just so confused..."
Ceaer_Reddit,Leather-Climate3438,"This just shows how confusing this part is bec. Yesterday a fan that loves the ending said Eren didn't redirected Dina like he did with bertoto (even that he could) so he would grow to hate titans and join the corp.

So which is which? Did he kill his mother intentionally or not?"
Ceaer_Reddit,ComputerOk6247,"Idc him having any involvement is bullshit just leave that as it was, also the Anime reworded his line to have him say he sent Dina towards her specifically when he couldve just sent her like, a dozen other directions"
Ceaer_Reddit,MayweatherSr,"I dont remember Bertholt was there. Is it just reaveal in the finale only, or did we see Bertholt there during that scene in the earlier episode?"
ComputerOk6247,Imconfusedithink,"I like that he killed his mom because if he didn't then there'd be more plot holes. Bert not dying to the Dina titan always felt so weird to me. I thought it was a plot hole for such a long time, so eren saving him fixed that for me. Plus if he could change those parts it doesn't make sense why he wouldn't save his mom through the paths so it was needed that his mom died for the rest of his life to go as it did."
MisplacedxLightbulb,Big_Daymo,"Like most here I didn't hate it, I thought it was pretty decent. I think like many, my biggest issue was with Eren's motivation. Its very muddy and unclear. I could be understanding it wrong, but we get like 5 reasons why he's doing the rumbling. He wants freedom for Paradis and his friends, he wants to wipe the rest of the world away, he doesn't want to but he's a slave to the future and the founder, he doesn't know why, he's an idiot... its a bit confusing. Yes some of these overlap and multiple can be true, but I'd simplify it personally. I'd carry over his titan hatred of ""the enemy"" to the outside world and have him refuse to see them as people at first (basically even more of an inverse Gabi). Then as he spends time with more of them (Yelena, Onyonkapon, Zeke, Falco etc) his ability to view them as inhuman enemies gets more difficult which is why he becomes so cold and distant. He basically separates himself from his humanity to avoid thinking about how immoral the rumbling is and how many innocent lives he's taking. Basically have him explain to Armin that he spent so long consumed with the idea of ""killing all of his enemies"", titan and human, that he couldn't let himself come to terms with the shifting morality of his mission. ""If I can just finish the mission I promised to complete years ago the people I care about will be free"".


Also this might be unpopular, but I'd remove the twist of him leading the Dina titan to eat his mother. I get it adds extra tragedy to what he felt he had to do and strengthens the feeling that he was destined to do all that he did, but it just feels a bit over the top to me. It doesn't really add all that much to me personally."
Big_Daymo,IWillFlakeOnOurPlans,"Yea Eren going back and forth between ‚ÄúI wanted to do it‚Äù and ‚ÄúI was forced to do it‚Äù was annoying, it really should have been more clear. 

It sucks cause I don‚Äôt think it was a bad ending but the execution felt soooo rushed, like the last chapter SO MUCH HAPPENS"
IWillFlakeOnOurPlans,Big_Daymo,"Agreed, I didn't even understand why the titans disappeared when I watched the finale. I thought Eren did it with the founder right before he died or something. Only later did I find out it was to do with Ymir letting herself die. The whole part about her issues being resolved by Mikasa really confused me. I guess she related to Mikasa being in love with Eren the way she was with Fritz? It was very confusing."
Big_Daymo,Ceaer_Reddit,"Eren's goals inevitably went to him destroying the world. It is his nature. He caused the rumbling because he willed it (not due him influencing the past but due to his nature). ""From the moment I was born, I've always been myself."" and in Chapter 131/Special 1 of the anime, ""When I figured out humanity lived beyond the walls, I was so disappointed. I wanted to destroy it all."". Ultimately Eren wasn't forced to do it. He was going to do it because that's who he is. Due to witnessing his own memories through Grisha (very complicated), he saw the view in special 1. The ""This is freedom."" shot. That was his goal, his own deranged version of freedom. More or less Eren is a slave to himself."
Big_Daymo,goonyen,"he didn‚Äôt exactly lead dina to carla. by letting bertolt live, dina had the opportunity to go to carla. a forced coincidence"
Big_Daymo,Beta_Whisperer,I don't think hating that Eren made Dina eat his own mother is an unpopular opinion.

MisplacedxLightbulb,EmuGroundbreaking857,"I didn't hate it, I actually really liked it for the most part, even the manga one aside from the dopey writing.

Having said that, I do still think the Mikasa / Ymir thing is a bit tenuous. I thought the direction they were going was ""Eren offered Ymir freedom of choice and autonomy, which Zeke didn't and no other founder did either, they only wanted to use Ymir"". It's simplistic but I do feel it makes a little bit more sense.

Now, I understand stockholm syndrome and so on - and that's a tragic and great angle to approach it from but **I really don't think Mikasa:Eren is equivalent to Ymir:Fritz**. You're telling me after 2000 years Ymir was like ""Damn bro, Mikasa is gonna kill you? Alright fair enough - she loves you and full power bro. I'll stop doing the titan thing."""
MisplacedxLightbulb,kimbolll,I was very underwhelmed by Eren‚Äôs final battle. It needed to be more grand. I probably would‚Äôve had him fight Godzilla.
kimbolll,The_Dark_Sapphire1,"Nah, have Zeke turn into a colossal titan form and be King Kong."
MisplacedxLightbulb,devildogmillman,"Uh... where do I get to start from? Frankly my biggest complaint was simply the fact that the final arc was a ""Civil War"". If thats what it was all leading up to then we should have had rifts between Eren and A&M before it actually did. Eren was the hero and Armin and Mikasa were his unabashedly loyal friends.  If they wanted to do an arc where Erens the villain thats cool but it felt wrong to have that be the end.

If were keeping the premise of the rumbling for the end, I A. Definitely think one of who became the alliance should have been one of the Yeagerists (Cause lets be honest- Flochs an interesting character but we don't care about him like Reiner or Jean) and B. REALLY think ONE, AT LEAST ONE of the alliance members should have died. Jean I think would actually be the best chcouce for both; He has a choice to make- Either join the Yeagerists and live peacefully, or fight with he alliance and risk death. I think if he picks the latter, he should pay the price.

Oh and obviously Eren's whole Mikasa thing was... silly. It had masterfully avouded being a series that revolves around romance till then end and then suddenly Erens jn love with her? It really seemed for most of the series like he... wasnt in love with her.

Edit:  Levi REALLY should have died too."
MisplacedxLightbulb,Leather-Climate3438,"Just focus on the main themes and storyline. I felt like Isayama is as confused as Eren on how to tie up the storylines and said to himself 'maybe another plot twist would do no harm' and it just alienate the earlier storylines bec. of how confusing the plot twists are

This series for 3 seasons deals with realities of war and at the end it turns out, oh I just want my friends to be the heroes and I'll just kill 80% of humanity like a half baked villain and half baked hero. Yes, Eren is confused bec. the author is confused too. 

But what did it to me is just throw out the Mikasa and Ymir Fritz storyline at the end. They never interested me compared to other characters"

MisplacedxLightbulb,Bluelantern9,"Remove the extra scenes and I can tolerate it. I didn't hate the ending, but all the extra scenes did was feed to the pseudo-intellectual hive mind and try and tell a (ankle) ""deep"" message about how humanity will always kill each other. It's pretty much pointless to the story and overall pointless because it's shit most people already know or are aware of and does absolutely nothing but attempt to drive in a senseless feeling of hopelessness. If I wanted a hopeless ending I would have been better off if everyone died with pure Titans flooding into the interior.

Also, I would remove Eren from killing his mom. Just leave it at the fact that Dina was abnormal. Simple/"
MisplacedxLightbulb,Striking_War,"I think Armin and Mikasa coulda been fleshed way more than what we got throughout season 4. I mean the whole time they pretty much got dragged around not knowing what's going, which was a huge waste. I woulda loved to see more flashback of them travelling to different countries to establish alliance whilst learning about peoples and cultures. Like we coulda get a small arc of Mikasa getting welcomed by her clan and learning about her heritage before getting conflicted about what she should do, join the clan or stay with Eren? That woulda given her a lot more agency. 
Also Armin always wanted to explore nature outside the walls so why not let him get some of that as well? Honestly this would make the ending much more impactful, since Eren isn't just killing people, he's also entire eco systems and natural habitats."

MisplacedxLightbulb,jsrant,"Thank you for at least trying to have a better understanding of people with a different viewpoint from yours, instead of just blindly inventing reasons why people don't like the ending like we can see here everydays. That's unfortunately rare currently."
MisplacedxLightbulb,Full_Plate_9391,"I can appreciate the message it is getting across, but I did not like the feels the mid-credits scene gave me."
MisplacedxLightbulb,Impressive-Ad8370,IF I was eren after medal ceromony i would tell everything to historia then kiss her go to paths puruade ymir tell her to you are free you can give all your power to me take the titan powers of warriors and after tell them to maximize their military and threaten the world army to not invade paradis and and they would attack then i'll be using 1000 of wall titan to destroy thier military and after doing this iam going to come into alliance with other nation and no nation is going to attack paradis for 5 decades or so it's enough time for paradis to completetly industrialized and after doing that eren and mikasa gonna marry and at the end of eren's life he is going to remove all the titan powers paradis should be enough powerful to defend itself for 100 years or so and eren was right he was an idiot
MisplacedxLightbulb,Kuwangerman,"Eren should have been back at Paradis all along and controlling the huge founder titan with warhammer umbilical cord. Then when they kill zeke and think they stopped the rumbling, it cuts to eren standing next to historia, he touches her and completes the rumbling"
MisplacedxLightbulb,Cinder_Fall01," Eren knew he was doing the rumbling of his own free will , to protect the ones he cared about , as far as his death im 50/50 

A : Eren Lives the rest of his days with his freinds after a full rumbling 

B : Mikasa Kills him but they all know that Eren did it to protect them and make them heroes , we also dont get that scene with him crying , and also the world doesnt bomb the people that saved their ass , even if it is thousands of years later"
MisplacedxLightbulb,LardHop,"I didnt hate it but more of meh when the last manga chapter released.

What would I have changed? nothing mappa didn't do yet. They did elevate it and made the ending land more gracefully and impactfully.

I am really lucky to be born in an era to witness it."
MisplacedxLightbulb,Old_Yeezus,"Give Ymir significant dialogue (or just any at all)

It‚Äôs tough to empathize with a character that doesn‚Äôt even talk, and we‚Äôre expected to understand her motivations to resolving the climax of the entire series. If her character is going to be so influential, it deserves legit depth"
MisplacedxLightbulb,azmarteal,"If small- I would remove Eren's-Armin's dialogue entirely, or rework it so Eren wouldn't be retconned to a dumb idiot who doesn't know what he was doing. 

If on the bigger scale - I would have Eren killed alliance, 100% of the world outside Paradis but left Mikasa and Armin alive. Eren would die afterwards because of the exhaustion. Afterall, saving Mikasa and Armin was one of his main goals."
MisplacedxLightbulb,NightKing_shouldawon,"Go read https://www.aotnorequiem.com/chapter/aot-no-requiem/part-1/ the majority of people who read the manga and didn‚Äôt like it (myself very much included) have been waiting for this to be finished. It‚Äôs a fan made ending for the last 4 chapters which is where most of us feel the entire story was changed to shoehorn in Mikasa+Erin and rushed the ending, and completely assassinated Erin‚Äôs character and motivations. A few things we like about this more: Erin is actually trying to rumble 100% of the world, Historia is important and not sidelined, more dialogue and conversations with Armin. Better explanation of the paths. Honestly just read these 3 chapters and tell me that what we got is better. I believe there will be 1 more ch but I‚Äôm not sure, there may be more planned."
NightKing_shouldawon,Worzon,"It is honestly baffling that you think you can write a better ending yet spell Eren's name wrong, misread the fact that Eren's intention was 100% of the world but was only able to accomplish 80%, and Historia is a character who has already experienced a full arc and doesn't need Eren's manipulation. I agree Armin and Eren's convo needed to be changed but the anime already did that.  


The only things that really needs to change is more Mikasa/Eren moments from the anime perspective and more foreshadowing for Ymir's intentions."
NightKing_shouldawon,Expensive_Curve_358,100% agree
NightKing_shouldawon,djdossia,i just read this and IMO its really bad and made me cringe even more
MisplacedxLightbulb,Only_Adhesiveness517,I loved the ending. Only change I'd make is that more people would've been eaten and/or blown away by those non-colossal titans that the Hallucigenia summoned at the end. I love seeing titans eat people.
MisplacedxLightbulb,bbbryce987,"Remove basically everything related from Ymir. We didn‚Äôt need an explanation about her loving the king, that was horrendous. Her ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù Mikasa also was a huge negative. Mikasa killing Eren shouldn‚Äôt have had her standing there watching, it should‚Äôve just been between them without some exterior factor 

Take out the twist of Eren killing his mother. Makes the show retroactively worse for shock value

Have Eren stand on the character he became instead of backpedaling to give him some form of redemption"
MisplacedxLightbulb,Fluffy_Procedure2135,Pump up that 80% to 100% üôèüôè
MisplacedxLightbulb,Drakob-Hitsimari,"I didn't hate the ending, I actually loved it, but if I could, I definitely would change it so Eren survives and has a kid with Mikasa."
MisplacedxLightbulb,invaderdavos,Armin was only kept alive for the sake of the last chapter. To many arguments for me for the end and ymir loving fritz i called bs
MisplacedxLightbulb,amcbain17,So fucking glad that corny requiem shit wasn‚Äôt brought into fruition. Thank god
MisplacedxLightbulb,Zoldrik190,Wheh Gabi and Falco were reuniting at the end I wanted them both crushed üòÄ but I also didn't hate the end
MisplacedxLightbulb,yomnot,"1. Eren's past-present-future and true motivation requires too much digging from different panels from different chapters. Eren had a several minutes of conversation with Armin where they even talked about it but nothing was clarified properly. Did he see in the future that the only way to stop the titan curse to do all the things he did, kinda like Avengers Endgame? Or he the furfure was set in stone and he was bound to do all those? If so, it should've been shown properly like all the other time paradox movies.
2. Ymir's realization from Mikasa's action felt really weird. She has been in the path for more than 2000 years. Considering time moves slowly there, she has experienced a lot longer than that. After all this time, suddenly some girl kills her lover and she realizes yeah I can do the same and not follow the order of my toxic husband?
3. How did Zeke and Armin specifically brought souls of specific dead people in the path? Why didn't Ymir stop it? 
4. Pieck should've died. I don't see why warhammer would keep her stabbed for so long but wouldn't make a spear with another hand and throw it to her nape. It could've added more depth.
5. Where did Halucina Genia go? what happened to it? There should've been a hint or something about it. No one even tried to see if it's still there and went inside the head of someone or something else."
MisplacedxLightbulb,AstralothZ,"I have definitly seen worse endings, but the quality of the story telling really seemed to drop off on the very last part. I thought Mikasa kissing evens severed head was a bold choice and real gross.  It lost a lot of impact for a lot of people when they look at it like ewwww. I didn't mind eren breaking down to armin and crying about how he didn't want to die,  but my wife hated it. It ruined that idea of who eren was that whole time.  She liked how cold and brutal he was and that moment disillusioned her from that narrative. Also they didn't clarify enough on what happened to the giant gooey centipede.  I assumed because eren died then it died as well?  All and all I didn't hate it but it did seem a lot more simple and basic compared to the rest of the show. If I had to guess I would say the writers had to rush slap an ending together.  That also seems a little evident in how little they touched on the nation's outside paradise in comparison of how much of the show is before they realize they are on an island. Still fantastic show from beginning to end and I give major props to having the balls to end the story. A lot of stories always leaving shit openened.  I got mad respect for any writer that puts a cap on the end of their story instead of just trying to milk the money out of it for as long as possible."
MisplacedxLightbulb,AnimeJunki3,"Annie suffered no consequences, Either she or her father should've died or was forced to be killed by her.

That biatch killed my petra! How DARE SHE!?"
MisplacedxLightbulb,MoneyAgent4616,"As someone who read maybe like 15 or so chapters and has only seen a couple episodes of an abridged version of the anime, this sub got recommended to me and I've already seen spoilers for it. Not that I mind it didn't peak my interest all that much but on the other hand of the spoilers I have heard including the time travel stuff just sounds like a massive reach. 

Just to clarify me not watching/reading it because it didn't peak my interest doesn't mean I'm attacking any of you for liking it or that I'm calling it bad. It just means I didn't find it interesting with the exception of pretty much all the spoilers I've seen in this thread about the whole time travel shenanigans. Outta left field that shit."
MisplacedxLightbulb,madcritter,"Eren should‚Äôve had conviction and eradicated humanity for the sake of his people. Leaving only the island of Perdi as the last bastion of humanity like we thought it was in the beginning completing the circle.

Not saying I agree with it at all but would‚Äôve been way more satisfying for me to just continue the dark theme and the weight of humanity being eradicated. Vs having everyone family survive miraculously on the last train of humanity and have a fun good ending where people praise Eren and he‚Äôs just an ‚Äúidiot ü§™‚Äù"
MisplacedxLightbulb,Rharyx,"I overall liked the ending, but I would've changed Historia's outcome. Hers was the only one that rubbed me the wrong way.

Forcing her into a position she never wanted and demanding she have a baby with some random dude was always a really weird decision."
MisplacedxLightbulb,treehann,"Good thread, I super agree that the anime improved upon the manga. I still think it felt a bit rushed and like other commenters already said, all the characters‚Äô plot armor hardened to obsidian. But not the worst ending by any means. I like how Zeke goes out."
MisplacedxLightbulb,Reddithereafter,"I only watched the last 2 episodes last night, so I'm still working through all that feels wrong, but I definitely think I'd start changes from Season 4 episode 1.

Taking the story to Marley was interesting, and I enjoyed parts of the season, but I think this 4th season is where things started to go off the rails. Consequently, any specific issues with episodes that I'd call out would likely have be resolved prior to even happening

Hated Gabi. For more reasons than her killing Sasha. I found her whole character annoying and ultimately unimportant (yes, she scored that shot, but another plot device would have existed and been used in her absence anyway if she wasn't around)

I'd have made Ymir make sense. I wouldn't have her have been in love/stock holmed with Fritz. 

Related to the above; Mikasa was Ymir's keikaku all along... Just no.

I wouldn't have Eren become an inscrutable villain for most of the season (and effectively 2 years)

I wouldn't have included the unnecessary line that Eren sent the Dina Titan to eat his mom. What did that even add to the story? It undermines some of my favourite moments, in SO many ways.

I would have either killed off Levi or left him whole. Levi isn't the character we need to have damaged to tell us that war leaves scars. I'm not even sure we needed any more of that at all with all the losses the series had doled out over the years."

TyrannosaurusRekt238,Mr_1ightning,"The team is more experienced with the show so I think they'll do better. Also more freelancers should be available since Mappa's JJK and Yasuke are just 2 hour movies, not entire seasons.

I'm just gonna leave you with the fact that MHA season 3 came out 9 months after season 2 and it had good animation despite being 25 epsisodes long."
Mr_1ightning,TyrannosaurusRekt238,"That's true. I really want 2d fights and MAPPA's drawings are brilliant, granted I'm probably being overly wishful.

I'm still excited"

fucc6,EldianTitanShifter,"Eh, Mappa has given us a double edged sword.

The Animators had a shitty schedule, and so they did what they could and it's not too bad. Not great, but it's... decent. I can respect them for it. 

But Mappa's higher ups and the Production Committee (such as Kodansha) are the ones to blame. You're right though, Mappa bit off far more than it could chew, and may have seen it as a cash grab more than anything else. 

Had they as the Final studio declined saying the deadline was too early, maybe it would've made the top Production Committee Board realize they were asking for the impossible, and would've diverted more resources and time to the project. 

I appreciate Season 4 is here, but no doubt it was rushed and could've been so much better. 

I'm one of the few who believe the Declaration of War/Warhammer Titan battle (basically the battle of Liberio) wasn't all that good, and could've been so much better in many ways, even the small things that could've been done in a more creative or at least Manga accurate way. 

But I digress; Shouldn't have agreed if they knew they had to cut corners and couldn't deliver their best possible work. Hopefully they blow the Blu Ray release out the water, but I'm not holding my breath."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,realrimurutempest,"God bless those MAPPA workers, they are going to need it."
realrimurutempest,aguero24,These Mappa workers will continue working on SNK until they die
realrimurutempest,Samthevidg,"MAPPA went hard this season, Jujutsu Kaisen and AoT were absolutely wonderful."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skandosh,"A lot of misinformation in this comment section . Winter 2021 means anywhere between January - March 2022 . 

Part 2 production started in October 2020 . So that makes 1.4 years ( or more ) of production for Part 2 compared to 8 months of part 1 with 16 episodes . If part 2 has 9-10 episodes then this is the best production schedule AoT has ever got . 

Get ready for good ass sakuga shots and 2D titans . Rumbling might still be CG .

Disclaimer : Mappa can still be like fuck AoT and make everything CG again/ get no freelancers so quality is not assured .

 The time is there but the question is if Mappa is there as well ."
Skandosh,abcvita2012,There is no way its 10 ep .. 15 min
abcvita2012,Skandosh,Its most probably 9-10 episodes because a split cour consists of 25-26 episodes . Part 1 had 16 so its obvious Part 2 will get 9-10 to reach that 25-26 mark . Btw its 25 mins and not 15 mins .
killinrin,FlotationDevice,PATHS chapters im fucking hype
Mrtheliger,Mahazzel,"yeah thats what im thinking. i loved every season of attack on titan, but honestly thought s4 part 1 was the weakest. had the most exposition and slowest pacing of all the seasons by FAR. and it really was all just a buildup and character introductions for the last arc which probably has the best chapters in the whole series"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cersei505,"was honestly expecting it 3 to 6 months from now, since mappa and the production commitee are crazy, so this is good news for a better schedule atleast, although not perfect."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Death_Usagi,"Note that in Japan each anime 1 cour/season schedule are of following

* Jan - End of March 
* April - End of June 
* July to End of Sept 
* October to End of December 

So if they fit in the Part 2 in 'Winter', like Part 1, it can go into December, or start from January."
Death_Usagi,ericg012,wrong. December is considered fall.
ericg012,Death_Usagi,"I know it's considered 'Fall anime season' but December counts as a Winter weather season (not going by anime cours). 

Pretty sure they went by the latter."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LastWarrior777,"Wow, hope the shards scene goes like this"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SausageGuzzler69,Can we just appreciate how goddamn majestic that piano music was
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ihatethenumber4,cant wait hope its great
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,symmetryconserved,"According to [this rather reliable leaker](https://twitter.com/Dacsubs/status/1376161141429313546), they have been working on the part 2 episodes while this season was airing, so the schedule is not as tight as it appears, although it is still fairly tight."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LzOt,"Oh my God, the way they animated the shards in the trailer. Amazing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,D_sasuke,"Not enough time, but still better than part 1 schedule."
D_sasuke,Rurouni720,They've been working on part 2 since October so I'd say time managment definitely mildly closer to their favor (not perfect but better than before)
Rurouni720,D_sasuke,"yeah so much better i think they've got as much time as WIT got for s3, i hope some good guest animators can join this time since the schedule is not as fucked up, this season suffered a lot from not having a main star animator"
D_sasuke,ecxetra,"You know work usually doesn‚Äôt start on something when its publicly announced?

Here‚Äôs an example: Fallout 4 was announced in June 2015 and came out in November 2015. It didn‚Äôt only take them 5 months to make that game."
ecxetra,D_sasuke,I know all that lmaoo. They've started the production of part 2 in late oct last year but they're still 6 months sorts according to your regular anime standards but i believe they can pull it off this time
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,epabafree,Some people said they began working on FSP2 when this Season Started itself. Which means it has around 10-12 Months. Finally a good schedule.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ANINETEEN,Winter is coming ‚ùÑÔ∏è This is gonna be amazing
ANINETEEN,GsoKobra12,"Ironic, when winter comes the walls are going to be broken in a more epic fashion than in Game of Thrones"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kouka27,Another 8-10 months schedule..
kouka27,NameIsAlreadyInUse,It's over a year for this one actualy. They have been working on Part 2 since October.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CringeNaeNaeBaby2,YMIRRRRRRRRR
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daze1717,"So, anime is also gonna end in spring. Big brain Mappa."
daze1717,Portgas_D-Ace,"OMMGG YESSS 
beautiful"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,diboo48,"Let's gooooooooooo then



... in some time.


Didn't expect the wait would be this less though. Hope MAPPA gives their best and don't rush it!"
diboo48,Eternal_Bookmark,">It's going to adapt Paths!

That's good!

>It's also going to adapt Rumbling!

That's bad..."
Eternal_Bookmark,MoazNasr,Why is it bad??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dragonking247,"Other animes: finally, now that MAPPA is calming down we can-

MAPPA with Jujutsu Kaisen 0, AOT Final season part 2, Chainsaw Man, etc.: On your left!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Danshot,"!remindme 9 months

hello future me, i just finished the final episode (16) of part 1. i hope part 2 gets a release date in 9 months!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HowiDisappear,Based MAPPA
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,curiousCat1009,Poggers. Not a movie but a part 2..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,feo_san,"I see people are saying that it will be like ""the same season"" and not actually a part 2, but the official website for the anime says:

**ÈÄ≤ÊíÉ„ÅÆÂ∑®‰∫∫„ÄçThe Final Season Part 2**

https://shingeki.tv/news/archives/6121

What's the lie? What's the truth? What to believe?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vocazados,"Downvote me if you want but this second part is going to have shitty CGI for the most parts including the rumbling, AOT deserve better than this but isn't Mappa fault, is the production committee fault for wanting the season in the shortest scheduled time."
vocazados,Cloven-1,"The Rumbling especially would have been CG regardless who animated it. It is entirely possible for 2D shifters if the schedule is better than part 1's. But odds are, due to the sheer scope of the action packed episodes to come, CG shifters will be a thing again, with 2D mixed in every now and then. 2D is ideal, but the CG we got for the most part was fine, the main issues for me was lighting and contrast. Now MAPPA has had some experience with the CG in AOT, they can improve and make it look better."
Cloven-1,ThePowerLord,At least WIT would have an amazing soundtrack to go with the CGI. Mappa's soundtrack for SNK S4 has been meh this season
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thegaslightwriter,"Good on you for being this fast though. Man, I hoped they would put some effort into this teaser, maybe they didn't have the time to do that. Now I have no idea if people will be hyped for this because it ended with eren looking at the airships."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ugowy,What if they do monthly releases for 40 to 60 minute episodes? I find it weird for them to mention ep 76 instead of part 2
Ugowy,EntertainmentMore624,That would be good and give them a good schedule too
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sufficient_Fella,It‚Äôs not a movie and we dont have to wait for 2 years or more :‚Äô)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Willant80,Can't wait for HALLU CHAN!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DragoCrafterr,"Kingdom Hearts ass music, absolutely adore it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Santviento_,"Started watching Attack on Titan when I was 11/12, looks like I‚Äôll be 21/22 when it‚Äôs over. grew up with these beats I‚Äôm gonna miss this sub despite all the toxicity"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H4G7,"This‚Äôs gonna be the longest summer in my whole life, and that‚Äôs not because I live in the Middle East"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TKWhiteStar,"I was hoping for a lot more time, i want quality you know."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yobolay,"9 months to adapt all that's left specially with all the action it has (and chainsaw man and jujutsu movie for around that time) is a really poor schedule. Wouldn't suprise me if it's the cheapest season yet.

Not like I expected anything different with the manga finished, but a shame nonetheless."
Onion-with-layers,Mango424,Maybe the first 6 episodes for War for Paradis/Paths arc and the other 6 for the Rumbling arc?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Creepy-Map3833,"9 months lmao, fuck this shit"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,alisonburgersm8,Any translation for the text in the teaser?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Last_of_the_Dragon,I honestly can't wait for the Pahts chapters being animated. I hope they'll have enough time tho
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kSIBIGforeheaddebt,So I presume this sub would stay decently active till the anime ends given that we are getting the part 2 soon enough.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hunterexblunter,LETS FUCKING GO!!!!!!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,INeverHaveGoodIdeas,"Stay calm and say it with me...

&#x200B;

**LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO**"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheZombi3z,So is this just one episode or the rest of the story? I'm assuming it's Part 2 of the season.
TheZombi3z,FusionShadow310,Rest of the story of course. You think they'll make us wait 9 to 10 months for one ep.
FusionShadow310,niteshadey,I don‚Äôt know it seems odd how they‚Äôre just announcing episode 76 rather than Final Season part 2
FusionShadow310,GreatQuestion,"Why did they say ""episode 76"" instead of ""final season, part two""?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Coinicidence,"Thank Ymir, I would have started the rumbling if it was a movie"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinkdaisiesss,"MAPPA really be putting in work this year, huh."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Reymon271,"Just to be clear since its just a contination of this season after they moved MAPPA, it shouldnt be as problematic as the first time around, since they dont need to get new staff and organize role like the first time, and from what I hesrd, they been working on it since October, so yes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Onion-with-layers,I lowkey want this to be delayed to Summer/Fall 2022 just so we can get hand drawn/ hq cg Titans.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,90dayswidow,I don't understand. Wtf is happening?
90dayswidow,NaviFili,Season 4 part 2 comes out on january 2022
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,st0lenfish,"Considering all the crazy shit they will have to animate for part 2, isn't this bad news?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lasernatoo,Less gooooo (dababy refrenc)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,That was a lot of Ymir at the beginning. Hells yea
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shadow144hz,"You got to be kidding me, I have to stay one more year in this sub? Dammit mappa but also thank you"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bohem1an_fapsody,What song is played here?? Anyone know??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,flatbushthePlatypus-,"Okay can someone explain what winter because Funimation said winter 2022, now is that January 2022 or December 2022?"
flatbushthePlatypus-,barson2408,It means we're getting part 2 somewhen between January - March 2022.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Accelerator-Deflect,THANK GOD it's not a movie üôè
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,littlebug16,"I just felt my heart sinking watching this teaser. I‚Äôm in awe of MAPPA and I can‚Äôt wait for it but also like can it last a bit longer, I‚Äôm already half grieving April 8th."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Energyc091,Isn't it a bit too soon? I am honestly afraid of how the CGI will look when our bois fight against all the titans
Energyc091,Tagliarini295,They got almost a year to have episode 1 ready. They got enough time.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ms_103127,Hopefully this will be enough time for everyone to digest the actual ending of the series -- regardless of how it ends -- and appreciate things one year from now.... :) :( -\_\_-
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rhylain,I hope that the animators have enough time. I‚Äôve seen other feedback of people going absolutely fucking nuts they have to wait that long. What a horrible position to be in. Give the animators a break.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,qvprlei,Guys what does it sayyy I can‚Äôt read Japanese üò≠
qvprlei,Tommy-Nook,it says „ÅÇ„Å™„Åü„ÅØ„Å∞„Åã„Åß„Åô
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,No-Cartographer5295,Isn't it supposed to be 2022?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ixameh,So when can we expect a proper trailer? Around august-september?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MetalFruitNamedMax,Why did they end it there.... should‚Äôve ended with Eren losing his head as the clifhanger
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Phoenix2405,"I live in an equatorial region, when the fuck is winter???"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JackUSA,Does anyone know the music that‚Äôs playing here? Having real Kingdom Hearts vibes from it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EldianTitanShifter,"Nice, with more time, maybe less awkward CGI. Also, having a movie  to finish it all up would been nice after Season 4 Part 2 hits a certain point.
 We'd get better budget and higher production value out of it as a move for the final battle."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RammusK,"i got depression reading some of this replays on the twitte  god damn i dont know what people want at this point , this season was perfect in everyway. 

&#x200B;

i fucking hate humans."
RammusK,takeme2infinity,Stay off twitter bro. You think people are toxic elsewhere? That place is for miserable people
takeme2infinity,RammusK,I don't even use twitter I just clicked to watch this short video . But God damnit I'll probably kill my self at this point if was using twitter.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Matt_37,"All the comments about MAPPA and I'm like

ANIMATED MEMORY SHARDS"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NIssanZaxima,"With the Manga ending in a week, it is cool to have 1 more year of something to look forward to with this series. In all honesty, I don't think there will be another series, story, piece of fiction that will ever have me as emotionally invested as this one and I don't even think I would want that anyways. No lie, at some points (typically around chapter releases) it takes my focus on more important things in my life. Not to the point where it is holding me back, bu I could have been definitely been more invested in my other priorities. 

This series has done so much for me in terms of re shaping my motivation, morals, and how I just generally think that is has made me numb towards most new animes, shows, stories etc. I only started reading the manga at chapter 113 too and watched the anime like 6 months before that. Kind of crazy to think about how obsessed I have been over the past 2 years of my life... but I will finally be FREE."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSilverSeraphim,"Would have preferred a Spring or Summer 2022 release so Mappa's staff can stop being rushed to hell and back, but thank FUCK it ain't a movie lol"
TheSilverSeraphim,cidalkimos,Most people don‚Äôt want to wait that long.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Urameshi9762,"the production will be better, they started working on part 2 in October (in the words of the leaker dac) and they have been working in parallel while the season aired, the good thing is that they no longer have to worry about pre-production since they have everything prepared, character design and script.
I assume that yuichiro hayashi will be in charge of the 2nd part in full since he only took care of some storyboards only in specific moments."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-Fletcher-,Anime series ruined confirmed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mericberktas,Oh god please delay it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,itstaha17,MAPPA SUPREMACY
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SparrowJump,I literally sceamed when I saw that piece of news...I'm so happy right now...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Katusuma,Looks like my AOT inflicted depression will endure one more year
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gilgamesh107,Is that a good thing? Seems like we gonna have the same animation problems we have now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WilliShaker,Would have love a movie instead ngl
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Holierthanu1,"Man, after all the needless complaints folks have had, Based MAPPA continues to deliver godly effort. I‚Äôm glad to see it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SunGodBrah,"So 8 months again for MAPPA to animate the rest... Uhg, fuck the production committee man. 

 I wanted them to have more time but I'll guess a decent adaptation will take place. In my opinion this series deserve a premium treatment bjt whatever. FUCK.

 They'll have more than before probably bjt still not enough imo."
SunGodBrah,GioMike,Don‚Äôt be ignorant please . Do yourself a favour and read more into it . They‚Äôve been working on part 2 since October 2020 .
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seanD117,So it‚Äôs gonna have shit cgi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aaronn_05,Fuck the ones in charge of scheduling. Hopefully it‚Äôs winter 2022(December 2022)
Aaronn_05,SuperNerd6527,That's.... what it is
SuperNerd6527,Aaronn_05,"What I mean is December 2022. I think they are releasing it in January-March 2022 which is also winter. So we don‚Äôt know which one rn 
(They‚Äôre releasing it in January-March, and Idk wtf you guys are downvoting me. Do you guys not prefer quality over an earlier release?)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaulVader2,"So no movie after all. Probably for the best, AoT works best as an episodic format.

Still, a bit disappointed with the schedule. Yes, it's a bit better than this season, but I would have imagined that since the manga was no longer ongoing they'd take like 2 years to really have the anime go out in a bang. Well, one full year isn't that bad either, let's hope we get episode 7 CGI levels of quality more consistently."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,putangas,Only one episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SolemnDemise,"Anyone else get ""Dearly Beloved"" from KH2 vibes from this promo track?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gutzukung,"Fr, this‚Äôs too less time. Sent death threat to the guy who accept this schedule plz. I know if people gonna said that ‚Äúdeath threats shouldn‚Äôt be a thing‚Äù but the animator received it and the director don‚Äôt seem to give a fuck so Lets make them felt it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kev_daddy,Is anyone else absolutely pissed it‚Äôs not a movie
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pizzahdawg,"My personal theory: They're going to still make a movie. Spend 8 episodes to flesh out the current arc, and setup for the final arc. Then conduct the final arc in an movie. I think that could work, and could maybe make sense resource wise? Then they could spend alot of resources on the final arc within the movie."
TheHungryHybrid,shiningmidsummer,"ah i see, i live in a country where we don‚Äôt experience winter, so i got confused. thanks for the clarification!"
TheHungryHybrid,One-LeggedDinosaur,Winter starts in December
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SicknessVoid,So it's one additional episode but it's longer than 20 minutes if I understood it correctly?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Oniichannotbaka,So hyped!!!!!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,The memory shards gave me an erection.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I-already-redd-it-,"Damn, first time I read this I thought it meant around October-December of 2022, but I forgot the winter season is December- March. That is not a lot of time, I am really scared"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kayounenka,"New speculation, winter in Japan could range between Jan-March, so it could be anywhere around it since S4 was released on end of fall season in Dec"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meapcuteee,Do you guys think the Rumbling Arc would work with CG? Cause it's definitely here to stay

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,patrick9772,Al right. For Episode 76 im gonna grow my hair out and get a 6 pack. In honor of Eren's final Battle
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Anniemal_Nitrate,What does it say?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crococatstew,Wait is that memory shards? Anyways I'm fucking happy for thisss
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dragon_Flaming,I wonder why it‚Äôs specifically episode 76 and not part 2?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turth3,"Just remember that leakers said that this season wouldn‚Äôt be spilt and that it would go until chapter 122. Leakers have been wrong about stuff so take the speculation of production starting in October as just that, speculation."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sajkhow,"So it's pretty much a year wait (counting from the season premiere) just like what i expected.

Hopefully everything will be fine by then so there are no same delays and all that"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,adat96,"Everyone saying that they need more time, its not like this announcement was made and they JUST started storyboarding and animating and shit. They announced this with the midseason finale in mind. They already have been working on  the second part for a while, but animating is still hard af and I wish them the best and all the time in the world even if it means a delay."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The-Codename,Mappa on its way to kill itself with the HUGE ASS WORKLOAD they gonna carry for the next season of anime

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jackaboy69216921,Just to clarify because I'm Australian and Don't go by seasons what month is this winter
Jackaboy69216921,Avram99,"Winter 2022 refers to the ""Anime"" season which airs from January to end of March 2022 so we can expect it then."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dhruvownz,Yo can someone tell me what chapter of the manga should I start reading from after the aot anime finale?
dhruvownz,poohead69,115 probably since they left some stuff out. But I'd just start from the beginning of Marley (90 I think)
poohead69,dhruvownz,Alright thanks
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Emiyelbarto,!RemindMe 1year
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MyDingaling_big,Ereh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aplek6,so this winter 2021  or 2022?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThePowerLord,This OST has been better than S4's so far so that's a step in the right direction
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ars-Boreas-Greyrat,Episode 76 will FALLOUT on winter!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Professional-Ad-7687,Can someone clarify? Will it be THIS winter 2021 or for real winter 2022 as in December 2022? Google has winter 2022 but I asked my Japanese friend to translate the tweet and she told me it said this winter 2021 so if anyone can confirm? Thank you!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AdvancedUniversity0,The memory shard scene is so beautiful /tear
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YerBoyDers,"So when they said Winter 2022, they meant Jan 2022 and not like Dec 2022?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KniGhTkinG0007,I can't wait
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NoFee7193,It would have been better if they had animated as well as finished chapter 119 as this season's last episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JosseCoupe,I'd rather wait 2 years for what they're gonna be animating. People need to learn to have some patience for Christ's sake.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mrcrepsley737,So did they change it to 2021 instead of 2022?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,L0Cat,i thought it was winter 2022

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,InoChaCheYo,THAT WAS GOOD AF LOWKEY WISH IT WAS A DIFFERENT OST BUT THE ENTIRE EPISODE OST WAS SO FIRE
InoChaCheYo,BenardoDiShaprio,Nah this only happens when you watch motion mangas. I had the same complaints about OST with last season when Levi fought the Beast titan but the anime onlies were happy.
BenardoDiShaprio,Gmuni,Funny it's the same OST üòÇ
BenardoDiShaprio,Alphora_,"Yeah if you take a look at the r/anime discussion, they are shitting themselves over how tense the whole episode was and how good the climax was, so I think the OST was able to do its job for them at least."
BenardoDiShaprio,TheMunch1,"Funny you say that, because I was an anime only when I watched Levi vs Beast Titan and I remember really liking the OST. Now that I've read the manga and started hanging around this sub, I had mixed feelings regarding the OST in this episode. With all the hype and speculation surrounding the songs, you kinda build up your own ideal version in your head and it feels weird when that ideal is not met."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EdricSnowbeard,"Interesting use of ost there, idk if I'm all for it yet. But I did enjoy the silence before it, really ominous. 

Otherwise the episode was perfect, I can't wait for the official release.
I waited years for this and it didn't disappoint, got chills."
EdricSnowbeard,ThePreciseClimber,I wonder what's the shortest and longest wait between manga chapter & anime episode in AoT. Longest wait would probably have to be the Beast Titan episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arafatnabi,It is like when we all expected Levi vs Beast titan to have Armored titan ost but it grew up on us. I think this will too.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,I think it'll be quite popular with anime-onlies BUT it won't live up to the insane hype manga readers have been building it up as. Tho the next few action episodes should win nearly everyone over even if they weren't completely satisfied with this one. Overall a success!
H-K_47,Freedom_scenery,"What makes declaration of war hype for me is the dialogue, of course the transformation is lit but imo the dialogue is what makes this scene one of the best in Aot ."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,Loved it overall! Great buildup and tension. Willy's actual speech could have been a bit more loud and intense tho IMO.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,I like the portrayal of Zofia in the anime much more than in manga. She looked cute in her scene with Pieck and when she covered her ears because of the loud music. This will make it even more painful next ep T\_T
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OEM-Sparkie,I have to say that Reiner‚Äôs VA was amazing this ep
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,halotx3,"I get why people wanted YouSeeBigGirl, I felt it was too lyrical and might have overwhelmed the dialogue so I'm glad they didnt use it there. The addition of the soliders about to breach the door really adds to the scene as well.  
The situation kinda reminds me of how people are with the Bruce Faulconer soundtrack for DBZ. Is it awesome yes, but does it need to be used in every epic/major moment multiple years later no."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skyclad__Observer,"K I N O

I thought it was pretty much perfect. They did a fucking incredible job in building up the tension throughout the episode, exactly as I was hoping for. I think the things that stood out to me the most were actually the moments of silence, where they gave certain moments just enough room to breath. There's a few cuts in the first half where Eren, Reiner, and Falco just stand around in the basement in complete silence with only the faint sound of music pouring through the window that was just great. I think the soundtrack choices were all fantastic and fitting of the tone, though I guess I sort of understand why some may have wanted something more bombastic over the actual transformation segment. Even then, I think the complete silence leading up to the actual transformation does a good job of keeping the tension there until the very climax, rather than tipping off the viewer that something big is going to happen as soon as the BGM peaks. My first time reading chapter 100, that was the prevailing feeling I was experiencing. Shear confusion over what Eren was about to do. At the very start it seems clear he's about to wreck havoc -- ""Same reason as you"". But as soon as the music changes to that sad soft piano piece, and Eren starts talking about understanding the people beyond the walls, you're suddenly thrown for a loop, questioning if all this was a misdirect, and Eren has really changed so much that he's willing to part ways with war and take a more peaceful route with Reiner. Of course, you're left with this feeling of uncertainty up to the very moment Eren stands up and starts to glow, and that's when I was really blown away (along with everyone in those apartments)

10/10 will definitely watch again"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zbearbear,I was a bundle of hype the whole episode waiting for Eren's transformation but honestly I think Falco's realization what was happening between Eren and Reiner was so well done.
Zbearbear,fandomgirl123,it was heartbreaking tbh. Falco kinda looked up to Eren.

Tsubasa_sama,BrunoSaurio,This is exactly what I imagined when I listened the Declaration of War song. I think it's okay to be a little upset. I mean we were waiting this moment to be the most important scene of the series (maybe tied with the end of chapter 122) . A lot of fans are saying the same about the transformation so I don't know why people think it's wrong to say the original song didn't match the scene.
Tsubasa_sama,Naskr,"Anyone who thinks 2volt is better than this is, frankly, insane."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raknel,"While I'm not a fan of the OST at the end, people had the exact same reaction to the scene where Armin ""died"" in S3. You'll get used to it.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DialedWrongNumber,This might be the birth of the 2Volt meme. I predict this will be used during Armin's transformation too.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,minneapolisriot,"I didn‚Äôt start reading the manga until around the time chapter 131 came out, and i had just binged the series before that. So when I watched the levi vs beast titan scene i was hyped, it was such a cool and satisfying moment and i absolutely loved it. Not once did i think to myself ‚Äúdamn, this really could‚Äôve used a better OST.‚Äù This is the situation most anime onlies are in with this episode, the problems we have are exclusive to manga readers who envisioned the scene in a certain way, and are now disappointed due to those very particular expectations"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zoufantastical,Best adapted episode so far. Everything was divine.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ch4inik,"absolute killer episode and i can't relate to the sudden OST-Outrage at all lmao. Even got goosebumps when the curtains fell and the Theatre staff behind Willy started playing live music, while he started his Speech. Reiner's breakdown was also just as emotional as i expected it to be. They even managed to portray the Attack Titan even more savage and vicious than in the Manga Counterpart. 

The only thing i would have wished for them not shying away from the gore of Willy Tybur's death and his abosolutely shocked Expression, before being swatted like a fly."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mzuark,I'm happy that more people than I expected are fine with the anime using an OST besides YSBG. Just because it wasn't like your fan videos doesn't mean it was wrong.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,erehbigpp,All things considered this is one of the best episodes so far for me. The pacing is very nice but I‚Äôm still getting used to the urge to add contrast and brightness on my screen
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cegoousado,What is Mappa doing? The perfect music for this ep would be Give Me Everything by Pitbull
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BioLizard18,"The liberties taken during Willy's speech/play were amazing.  


All the extra details and anime-only shots blew me away.  


When Willy talks about how King Fritz would ""accept destruction"" and we see that visual of one of the walls being blasted open, debris frozen in the air, it's just awe-inspiring.  


That and all the other details, like the other members of the play being clearly defined and having the rumbling intercut with people's reactions.  


I agree that the music for the last scene didn't quite reach the hype that most people (me included) had built up for the scene but... I still liked it! It's disappointing to see the music has consistently been the least engaging part of S4, considering how perfect the music was in S1-3."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,"i think this episode was FUCKING INSANE, but i cant lie that i prefer the mangas execution better

in the manga i felt like things were going at a slower pace and at the same time there was still a LOT of tension in the air, then all of a sudden eren fucking transforms and destroys the stage. the way it was set up in the manga really gave more off a slow ticking time bomb feel which is why erens transformation hits a lot harder for me there

in the anime i didnt get to feel the same 'ticking time bomb' feel. it was there, but it was significantly weaker imo. i think the reason why erens transformation felt less explosive was just because they slowed it down. they made erens initial transformation when he shook reiners hand a slow mo, and then the way the buildings cracked felt slower than i expected. if it was more instantaneous BUT with a little bit more setup beforehand it would have been much more hype

nontheless i think it was fucking AMAZING tho. for yall in the thread saying 'you guys are complaining too much blah blah' I LOVE THE EPISODE OKAY. BUT I CAN COMMEBT MY CRITICISMS IF I WANT TO ITS THE INTERNET"
Raviolla,OEM-Sparkie,"I feel like it would be extremely difficult to execute the episode the same way as the manga without it feeling all over the place with weird pacing, it works amazingly for the manga but it probably wouldn‚Äôt for the anime."
Raviolla,Final-Solid,"It‚Äôs just some of the finer differences that make the manga such a different experience, which in all honesty is hard to adapt properly."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DialedWrongNumber,"I honestly thought they would have removed the OP from this episode to let it breath. The visuals are insane and I really like how they stringed together Reiner and Eren conversation. I kinda wanted to see more of Reiner's breakdown and felt like they could have slowed it down there. 

The 2Volt OST was underwhelming for me during the transformation but I felt so much tension and really enjoyed when the S1 OST hit (whenever Willy announced Eren's name).  I definitely have manga syndrome when watching these eps and reimagining this moment in my head multiple times. I'm so glad we are finally here.

I can't wait to see once official subs release!"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gameboysixty9,next 3 months are gonna be the best time ever to be the fan of the series .. i already know i am crying once this season and manga ends...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Remarkable-Mousse-96,"Life lesson i got from this sub
Overexpectation is bad. Just be neutral in everything."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yeesaks,SAMURAI SHOW HYPEEEEEE
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zan_tgg,"Anime onlies absolutely loved this episode, source: all my AoT fan friends. It's the exact same as the levi vs beast titan scene, manga readers were so disappointed with the ost but the anime onlies absolutely loved it. Same thing for this. Osts used in motion mangas would have been unreal, 2volt is an interesting choice, def not the best, but not the worst like most of this sub is saying."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,14MySterY-,No anime-only would open this episode and complain about the ost right away after watching.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,"The anime-onlies have entered their ""Eren is pulling a Lelouch"" phase."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eldian_man,That slightly shocked look Eren gives Reiner when Reiner breaks down and confesses that he forced Annie and Bert to go along with him and that he really wanted to be a hero makes so much more sense after reading 130/131. They truly are the same.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FostertheReno,I wannna see reactions to Eren cutting off his leg and putting a bullet in his eye lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sparteh,"The declaration of war is without a doubt 1 of the top 3 moments I wanted to see adapted. Seriously, I couldn't wipe smile of my face the entire episode. Who is the same?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nicktsann,"After rewatching the scene MANY times and seeing some edits with both YOUSEEBIGGIRL and the leaked OST I can say:

The choice isn't actually that bad, it fits the tone and the suspense building up. 

YOUSEEBIGGIRL fits the moment, not the scene. It is nice for edits, just that. 

It is such a shame the leaked OST wasn't used, it actually fitted really well. Hope we hear it somewhere in the future."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lila_robbins,My anime only friend thought that yelena was undercover armin. I confirmed that for her.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSilverSeraphim,"Bruh Mappa has no chill, Udo getting knee'd in the next episode preview timed up perfectly with the drum beat of the music lmfao"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The-Maple-Leaf,Ngl kinda disliked the way they made it so dusty when Eren killed Willy
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinkdaisiesss,I will forever associate YouSeeBigGirl with Reiner and Bertholdt's transformations in S2 so I don't mind a different track being used for Eren tbh.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Swolekage_,I‚Äôve waited 4 years for it to be animated. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. It‚Äôll never be the warrior reveal but this is a close one for favorite moments for me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sisifuzz,"... and then king Fritz made a pledge to renounce war that prevent inheritors from using the full powers of the founding titan freely, and with pledge I mean some kind of chains made from sand on a plane of existence on a hipothetical  5th dimension trascending space and time"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mercurylovesvenus,"Another episode of Falco being absolutely adorable. He‚Äôs so tiny, I loved the way Reiner ran to protect him when Eren was transforming ü•∫üíï. And goddamn, Yelena is a giant. I can‚Äôt wait for the next episode, it‚Äôs cliffhanger after cliffhanger but ahhh!! So amazing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nallcho14,OST was fine
nallcho14,Matt_37,"I agree. It could have been grander, but it wasn't a trainwreck like some are deeming it. It certainly did not 'ruin the entire episode/season/show/franchise'."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Edwin5302,"LMAO anime onlies thinking Yelena is Armin.

I mean, can't blame them after the theories that were made when the chapter came out in the manga, but it's still funny."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sisaac,Can we *please* talk about how Yuki Kaji just NAILED Eren's monologue? and how Reiner's VA also did a great job in his confession?
Sisaac,Morbo03,AoT‚Äôs voice actors are damn good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fiercepaws,In the manga I always felt like Eren was right for doing this but now that I see the character's expressions and willy's face right as Eren is about to kill him...I just can't help but pity them
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arafatnabi,Anyone else feel this tightness in chest. Its like when your crush asks for your help type of tightness. The pure adrenaline rush. Cant wait for the episode to break the internet
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shoestrung,"For the last fucking time, neither WIT nor MAPPA decide the soundtrack lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shibboleth2005,"I'll wait until the subs and higher video quality for final judgement. Felt really good for most of it though, I think they got the tension which was the most important part. I would have preferred the transformation to be way more hyped up though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,Everybody so excited over the episode no one is noticing that the Chapter 136 discussion thread is about to hit 10 000 comments.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,velONIONraptor,"The episode is nowhere *near* as bad as some people are making it out to be. Easy 10/10, 2volt for Eren‚Äôs transformation was a bit anti-climactic but still good"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rexytitan,"I just wished they had the face of the Attack Titan flash on Eren's before he transformed, like Reiner and Bert in S2."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LeapingTitan,"As laughable as some of these rage boner-induced criticisms are, I have to admit that I used to be like this too. I wasn't too impressed by Season 3 Part 2's adaptation for the most part as a lot of it had similar issues to what I see people complaining about in this week's episode. Animation, music choice, etc... so since then, I've kept my expectations low and realized that how I imagine manga panels in my head does absolutely not mean that's how the staff who gets to animate it imagines it. Keep your expectations low, and you won't get disappointed.

That said, I did enjoy this episode, and I can understand people who were disappointed, because I was like that as well like I said. So trust me when I say that it's not healthy."
LeapingTitan,sohamsharma69,"""Im the same as you"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Anniemal_Nitrate,"This complaining about the OST feels like some kind of a parody rn. At first I got agitated about people complaining about the trailer theme playing 2 times but not giving a shit when …ôtÀà√¶k 0N tŒ¨…™tn plays 9000 times on season 1, but this is straight up funny. And before someone comes tell me about m-muh Sawano, it's the same fucking sound director as always picking the songs and Yamamoto's tracks have been a minority on this season already.

I watched a stream and it felt a bit meh animation-wise in some parts but not gonna shit on it until I see it full HD"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ElMondoH,"Willy's death is no longer just a manga spoiler. The Warhammer Titan is now an upcoming anime spoiler. Yelena has finally hit the scene. 

And Zofia and Udo only have one episode left. üò¢

Man, we've come a long way... and there's still a long way to go. But damn, so much has changed since the basement, hasn't it?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yeesaks,SONO NAWA EREN YEAGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,penguins2946,"It's interesting that they added the scene of the Marley soldiers about to enter the room that Eren and Reiner were in. I don't think that was in the manga, but it really emphasizes that Marley knew that the scouts had infiltrated Marley."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tsubasa_sama,"After a few rewatches I don't mind the final scene as much, it seems like MAPPA wanted it to feel more sudden than I was expecting it to feel after reading the manga/watching fanmade versions - hence the rather quick cut to 2Volt. I still greatly prefer the version with the trailer theme but it's not irredeemable."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,scaptastic,"I can‚Äôt wait for the dub. I know it gets shit on but it‚Äôs one of the best, on the same level as FMAB"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thevirginiatheater,"Still have chills. Thinking about the ending theme is making me almost tear up. If you told me in 2013 that this would end up being my favorite piece of fiction ever, I don‚Äôt think I would believe you. But dang I love this show so much"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Matt_37,"I really fucking loved this episode. Chills all the way through. VAs knocked it out of the park. Willy's play was beautiful. The OST during the whole thing was on point. I really appreciate it that they didn't change/censor Eren killing Willy and that they paid attention to facial expressions and mannerisms. I'm almost certain that the CG shot of the Attack Titan is the one in which we can see his abs? His model is either impressive or the blending/blur/smoke hides it well (or I'm blind).

The transformation OST was just fine, I'd personally prefer the trailer OST for that but it is what it is. Wouldn't say it was bad. Haven't seen anime onlies complain, I guess they wouldn't since they must not have seen motion mangas/fan animations.

It could have been a grander song, but I was fine with what we got, still had chills throughout and my anime only GF was so impressed she asked to watch it again twice for the first time since RtS.

Very happy to see this animated, and well done at that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lithiumb0mb,"How lucky are we ro finally see this animated finally? I'm thankful Mappa took this on. I know many are complaining about the music, but I felt it was fine. I am waiting to see the anime onlies think Yelena is Armin lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,"Y'all are as pessimistic as always I see. I've genuinely never imagined Youseebiggirl fitting with the tone of 100, the only reason I can even imagine it working is for a parallel with Warrior, which in theory is cool but the moments are very different. The Declaration of War is more akin to Annie's transformation in Stohess than Warrior, since both are situations where the opposing party know exactly what's coming but are helpless to really stop it.

Personally I would've preferred a new OST than 2volt, but after listening to the portion of 2volt they use I can see it working much better than Youseebiggirl. I think a lot of people just have it in their heads that nothing can top youseebiggirl, even though WMID literally already exists. From more rational comments it sounds like the episode was really good, if more of a budget saving one from an animation perspective, but had a few things that definitely were negative.

Basically, what I've been saying from before the first episode. This isn't going to top the manga, and people who thought it could had way too high expectations and had likely not even read the manga from before the timeskip, so they don't even know that WIT's adaptation skipped a lot and even wasn't better from a visual perspective by season 3."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tyranythan,"I didn't really like the inclusion of the random marlayan army troops ready to storm the eren room. it wasn't in the manga and doesn't make sense as falco and reiner left without saying where they where going to. It also makes the last eren scenes less tense, before eren transforms its not entirely certain if he will. Only 2 people know that eren is in that room and he could have maybe made a deal with reiner and somehow gotten away. in the anime he has pushed into a corner, he doesn't know that but we do. This then gives him the choice to transform or die. its combined like a 5 second scene of soldiers getting ready but it changes a lot of the wonder of what eren is about to do."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fukato,I remember people shitting on wit for using 2volt during levi vs beast.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hussor,"Bit disappointed that the Zeke/Eren parallel got cut, but overall a good episode. Also the Magath-Willy conversation at the start of chapter 100 got cut but that might be put at the start of next ep since it would be kinda in the middle of the episode otherwise."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,harambegs,"I don't really care about what ost they should've used, but the whole Eren transformation wasn't satisfying. This was one of the defining moments of aot and deserved better. The rest of the episode was great, though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ferroargentum,"I've watched S2 Ep 6 this morning just to get that feeling of epicity again. But watching this episode was so different, I literally couldn't take a smile out of my face, by the end I felt so massively hyped giggling like a dumbass.   
Massively subjective due to the hype I'm feeling but for me right now this is the best episode of Attack on Titan I've ever seen, and even tho I can see some crying ""where youseebiggirl?"" I loved the OST and felt that it fitted perfectly  


(That being said Yelena best girl)"

Only the line ""i wish you can kill me "" is pretty weird ,and the 3d eren's hair at the end is really sexy ,and the transfrom is really powerfull and smooth ,really hyped me up ,if i got to say something unfortunately ,i think the audiances' reaction about the story while willy just start is not quiet well ,overall a welldone episode!"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DodzReincarnated,"Not sure if anyone else noticed but the scene where eren smashes the stage and throws Willy it looks likes the attack titan is actually CG, just for like 2 seconds. it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, I think the CG is pretty good and nowhere near the atrocity some claim it is. just pointing it out."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,genesis1v9,"OST at the end could‚Äôve been better but this sub is really overreacting tbh. My main complaint is just off model drawings of Eren which looked weird when he talked.

Direction, voice acting and soundtrack were great and yes ending soundtrack could‚Äôve been better but didn‚Äôt ‚Äúruin‚Äù the transformation either. I‚Äôm more mad with the lack of animation and mostly stills being used."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,reddadz,"I can understand (and somewhat agree) with the OST complaint. I personally didn't want YSBG but 2Volt seemed too triumphant. Which is weird since MAPPA seems to be portraying Eren with less emotion than I expected, hence there's a clash with the music.

Upon rewatch, I like the whole declaration scene a lot more now; the first time, it was underwhelming to me. Willy's play was portrayed well & the tension was so thick the entire episode. Really the only issue I have was the tonal dissonance with the OST.

These 2 chapters had 99% dialogue so the still images didn't bother me. They actually fit way more than I expected (saw a rumor that the Warrior trap & Karina/Leonhart would be moved to next episode). 

I'd give this a 8.5/10. People understandably had extremely high expectations given this is easily a top 3 moment in the manga & I can see why they'd be disappointed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lasernatoo,"I'm *literally* shitting my pants as I type this. How could MAPPA not adapt my Eren x Willy erotic fanfiction despite me repeatedly emailing it to them every week since it was announced they would be doing this season? And now Willy is dead, so it can never happen. Thanks a lot, MAPPA. Thanks for nothing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,creamofbeans,Why were people complaining abt the music? I thought this episode was so awesome to finally see. It was so fucking cool to see the band start playing and hearing nostalgic music from s1. I‚Äôm hype.
creamofbeans,H0useBlend,"People are complaining it isn't as ""bombastic"" as they wanted it. Reminder to keep in mind that you already knowing that Eren will transform changes how you want the scene, vs teh anime-onlies who don't know whether of not he will trnasform.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hopeful_Doughnut_199,"Waiting for subs but I have a hard time believing the OST is that much of a mood killer. It will be interesting to see how anime onlies react, as they‚Äôre going into the episode with less expectations"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CubicCrustacean,I'm not the biggest fan of the ost used in this way either but why do most people here propose YSBG instead? Sounds a bit too sad imo and lacks the horror the scene portrays
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Karma_Death,"Idk why, but the moment Wilbur declared war on Paradis, I thought it'd be same timing as Eren coming out, like how the manga panel did it. I could be nick picking here though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xxMeiaxx,Eren's new titan form is pumping juice and went to the dentist lmao.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Viffido,"Watched the episode again, really good, even without YouSeeBigGirl, but I HATE the inclusion of the marleyian soldiers closing in on Eren, Reiner and Falco, which implies that Eren has limited choices and HAS to transform, which makes his act less vile, and the omision of the families above getting absolutely destroyed by Eren as well.

I feel that Mappa/Isayama are trying to make the audience symphatetic towards Eren and that would kill it for me. Show that Eren is a monster who will do anything even if it kill haundred of innocents, you cowards!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BattedDeer55,Holy shit that was so good I can‚Äôt wait for next week
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CherryCokeaine,"Okay, rewatched the episode and it was fucking amazing with subs. I had chills for the whole fucking episode, I originally thought the OST at the end was meh but now I think it fits really good. My one issue is the end of Willys speech, the angle, the delivery of the VA on how he hated his blood, and the removal of Zeke suck. But honestly thats a nitpick, seriously a 9.5/10 episode. Easily the best episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,skeller75,"I think the transformation was executed really well. Eren even points it out by mentioning how many people were in the building above him. When he transformed and killed all those people, it was intentionally portrayed as sinister rather than heroic. Music choice was perfect for that, in my opinion."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Masutato,"I'm more irritated with the way Crunchyroll translated Eren's final words before his transformation. ""I just keep moving forward until I destroy my enemies."" sounds way less badass than ""I just keep moving forward until all of my enemies are destroyed.""."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Intelligent_Doubt703,I just wanna see how would they do 3D manuvers + levi vs beast titan
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,someroastedbeef,"hahahah holy shit this sub nitpicking the episode for OST choice which was perfectly fine and now AOT at #2 on MAL

https://myanimelist.net/anime/40028/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Anshel,"I honestly don't have a problem with the ost. I got wrapped up in the moment of what was happening that it didn't even matter. I suppose it being such an epic moment for the manga readers, 3 years of waiting for this to be animated, videos of the manga with music in the background, and all the hype could only result in one thing. Disappointment. A lesson to all, try your damndest to not let your own hype ruin anything. Hope for the best, expect the worst. 

The only thing I was confused about was the disclaimer. Why this episode? I feel like that really misled people into expecting something that wasn't going to happen. Imo, it should have been used in the next episode due to the stampede and slaughter by Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"I heard that the person who was responsible for the episode got a lot of negative feedback and it's now depressed. is that true? holy fuck some people really deserve a kick in their teeth, at least."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Williace,"I really should stop coming here for episode discussion. Most people here are toxic.
People calling episode bad cuz ost choice."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sujallamichhaneakasl,Y'all who said the episode was not on par should be slapped. I just watched it and from beginning to end it was nothing but greatness....I feel like this episode literally couldn't have been any more perfect.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"On my 3rd rewatch and the music was perfect, screw you guys.

THe whole episode is super dark and grim and tense and the music there continued that. The drums with the image frozen on Willy being fucked up was perfect. The music this sub wants would have been too upbeat (for lack of a better word) and energetic.

If they had done the declaration mid episode then the more energetic music would have been fine to continue the action."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SomeRandomGuy33,"90% of these complaints are not going to matter jack shit for anime onlies that have nothing to compare it to, so I'm still happy."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tot567,"I either watched an edited episode or the ost was great, was very audible and was a better song choice than youseebigirl. The episode felt great maybe because I don't remember scene by scene from the manga but the explanation with the animation of the story and the drums and music were my favorite part, the music was good. I do not like that the part when he says EREN YAEGER! was meh, there was no shot of Eren or I don't know, some intensity
edit: okay I rewatched it now and it does seem like the music was lacking I don't know why I remember the part differently but I was very engaged on the whole scene."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"I've read literally 0 complaints about OST from anime onlies

People here need to stop comparing the episodes to what they imagined in their head."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DK_1287YT,"My god, that pacing. My heartbeat was fuckin escalating the entire time and that ending was perfect. It really is a shame I have to wait a week to see how good MAPPA's adaptation of fights are, but if god of highschool is anything to go by, *woooooowiie!* am I in for a treat. It's times like these I'm glad I read the manga. After reading a few other comments I went back and rewatched the ending and yeah they definitely coulda used a better song than some royalty free ass YT sounding song but I didn't really notice it at all on my first watch, so maybe it isnt as bad as people think? But that could be the tunnel vision I had when  watching the episode speaking , though. Either way I still think  this is a 9.5/10, docking 5 decimals only because of the OST. But *daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn* everything else?  Fuckin awesome."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarthStallord98,"Are we not allowed to criticize? For every person complaining about the music, 10 people pounce that person telling them to stop whining. I defended the shit out of the past 4 episodes. Even the cuts to Reiner's backstory. I understood that MAPPA was allocating their resources and I was very pleased with their choices. 

For this episode, I wasn't really pleased all that much. I thought the animation during Eren and Reiner's talk was too stiff. I thought the music choices weren't that good. I think the leaked ost would've been perfect. Everything just seemed to go by too fast. It didn't have the same impact as the slow buildup of the RB reveal in season 2. I was a manga reader for both of these scenes.

I know how ungrateful people can be given how overworked MAPPA has been with the insane deadline for this anime. I still am enjoying this season overall very much and am excited for these next few episodes. But I did not really like this episode from an artistic perspective. I thought the directing and sound design could've been much better. The stiff animation is something I can definitely overlook given how much of a workload the animators are dealing with. 

If you enjoyed this episode then don't let me or anyone else ruin that for you. This is the peak of Attack on Titan storywise in my opinion. Just don't completely shit on people who don't like it as much as you do.

2 DAYS LATER EDIT ~ After rewatching this episode a few times I absolutely love it lol. Even everything I said I disliked earlier. I loved the musical cues (still would've preferred something a bit more epic at the end). I love the visuals. The animation has grown on me. I feel a little bad now for what I said earlier. It was kind of an immediate reaction after seeing the episode on a shitty NHK stream without subtitles. Although, I still stand by my point about not ragging on people who don't like certain things about this show. It's not a perfect show because there's no such 
 thing as a perfect show. Their complaints only seem annoying because YOU choose to respond to them instead of ignoring it and not letting it diminish your enjoyment."
DarthStallord98,MysticJohn,"People get very emotional when defending something they like, maybe because they don't want to believe that they like something that is flawed or perhaps because they perceive it as some sort of personal attack. Regardless, this leads to them becoming very emotional in their replies and resorting to personal attacks rather than proposing valid opinions of their own in response.

Its unfortunate that a lot of people are forgetting that we're all here cause we love this manga deeply, and no one is criticizing it just for the sake of criticizing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chaderenabs,I think the ep was fire but some fans are already crying and rioting over YOU SEE BIGGIRL OST
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,This thread has roughly 10 times as many comments as the corresponding one on the SnK sub. Neat.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kethanol,"You can not compare Eren's transformation scene with the RB transformation. The main theme of that one was betrayal, hence the intense music that accompanied it.

In this scene, Eren's transformation was expected. So please judge objectively. It was well executed, in my opinion, showing that Eren does not need fancy stuff to bring the shit down. 
It did not have a big build up, just some question and answer exchanges.

And no, the theme was not revenge either, as said by Eren. He just keeps moving forward. That's all."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,this scene just make me remember that if Willy wanted peace with Paradis he would have achieved it for real. Eren definitely wouldn't have attacked it if the world didn't want the war. pretty sad. guess they have it coming.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lor3l3i,Finally. After these long months of waiting we are about to witness historic day.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Voi69,"I genuinely feel giddy thinking about the episode. My body tenses at imagining what is to come. We have waited for a long time wondering how it would look animated. After today, our dreams will be crushed and replaced by the reality that Mappa gives us."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,coraaline,Damn samurai show declaring war too?? ;-;
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,"THE RUMBLING

THAT SCENERY"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,"also i understand their reason for cutting the carriage scene, but i honestly felt like that start to ch100 is what made eren's transformation more hype

its a super underrated part of the manga imo. willy and magath's talk set up the fact there is an EXPECTED ATTACK during the festival which adds even more tension in the air, youre left thinking of the 100 possible things eren might do that would be this unforeseen attack willh and magath would do

but again i understand why they cut it, better for the animes pacing and all"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TSmasher1000,"I have been waiting for this episode for 3 years. It's adapted my second favorite chapter in the whole series (with my favorite being 121) and while some foreshadowing scenes did not transfer over (such as the scene where Willy's talking about wanting to die, showing Zeke and then wanting to live because he was born showing Eren) I am so happy on the way they adapted it. Damn I'm so hyped to see the anime-onlies react to this!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kodaroni,Tbh I completely understand people that didn‚Äôt like the choice of ost. One of SnK‚Äôs biggest strengths is the music.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mafkumin,"PLEASE IMPORTANT QUESTION

What's the actual name of the samurai show"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gilgamesh107,where are you people watching this?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JuicyDragonCat,"to all of you saying you prefer the leaked trailer theme ost

SAMUEL KIM'S TRACK ON YOUTUBE IS NOT THE SAME THING. The whole ""slow trailer orchestra"" at the end is not present in the actual leaked ost, he made that himself. So even if they used trailer ost it would not have sounded like that"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nath_122,Sweet episode although not as interesting as a manga reader as the next ones I guess
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seasalt-and-oranges,"I just watched it and for me, the episode was great!!! I felt anxious the whole time lol, even though I already knew what Eren was going to do. Also, I am weirdly hyped for having seen Mr. Leonhart, and Yelena's VA sounded really cool.

Personally, I did not have a problem with the OST that was used at all. My only nitpick is maybe how the ending shots were animated. There was indeed too much smoke and it was hard to see what was going on. I wonder if they did that due to censorship, or production limitations. Would love to see that fixed in the blu-ray.

Otherwise, the episode was amazing and was over way too fast! I am excited for NEXT WEEK!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"Mildly spicy take: I think that CG Eren was actually the best looking shot of his titan in this episode. Something about the way he moved just looked so visceral to me, I dunno."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arafatnabi,"After watching the final scene a few times, it grew on me. This epsidoe is 10/10 for me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KyloTennant,"Epic stuff, now I can't wait for next week when we get to see the Warhammer Titan battle animated!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DinoLaserFight,That warning at the begining of the episode made me think I needed to bring an adult to accompany me when viewing the film lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bandoozle,Eren got fat
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SqurtieMan,"I know I should've pointed this out for the last episode, the only thing I wish they kept was Eren saying ""Good to see you made it back to your hometown"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_JayGaming23,Damn that episode was great. Willy's speech was fantastic. The transformation scene tho imo was just alright. Lacked the climactic oomph compared to past transformation scenes we have seen.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinecone4506,Reiners VA was the star of this episode. Willy was amazing too
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Putanegginyourshoe,"Okay. I've read the manga but seeing Willy's production animated got me angry all over again. He confesses Helos never existed and that the true hero was King Fritz. He confesses Paradis NEVER planned to attack the world... But then goes on to declare war on who he believes is a genuine threat to the world, rather than opening a dialogue with their enemies! Willy dawg, what the fuck?

Otherwise. Lovely episode. I mean it could've been better during the declaration of war, but still really enjoyable."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Walpknut,"They are really emphazising the features of the Attack Titan to make it looke like a terrifying monster. On the preview it doesn't even have Eren's eyes. 

How many episode do you figure the Raid on Liberio is gonna get? 2? 3? The action bits usually get more episodes than the talky bits and the raid is pretty badass."
Walpknut,Everdale,"We have the names for the upcoming episodes. The next episodes are titled, ""Warhammer Titan"", ""Assault"", and ""Assassin's Bullet"". With that knowledge we can assume that the raid will likely last 2.5 episodes with Assassin's Bullet probably ending with Eren laughing at Sasha's death."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,009reloaded,"This was fantastic!

I think people‚Äôs grievances with the transformation scene are misplaced. Could it have been a bit better? Sure. BUT, I think people are forgetting something important: Eren transforming here is supposed to be a surprise. Using YSBG would suck all the surprise out of the scene, as it has too much build up. Same with the ‚Äúleaked‚Äù OST."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaximusPrime987,Not ready to watch Zofia and Udo die
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SendtheClown,"There are a few general things I tbh still don‚Äôt funny understand unfortunately, so if anyone can clear it up for me it would be very helpful! 

1. Why did Marley actually infiltrate Paradis? I know it‚Äôs to retrieve the founding titan and to get resources, but the last king announced that they would start the rumbling if Marley infiltrates? I know it was a bluff and that he would accept it if they did, but I thought Marley/the rest of the world didn‚Äôt know it was a bluff and they know that the rumbling would destroy the world. I think I‚Äôm missing smth there
2. Also, Marley wants to take the founding titan for themselves and use it to strengthen their forces, but how is it possible for them to use it as only a royal Eldian is able to use the founding titan‚Äôs power and they don‚Äôt have any royals (they don‚Äôt know Zeke‚Äôs a royal and he‚Äôs supposed to die soon around this time)?"
SendtheClown,supern00b64,"1. The Warriors' operation was meant to be covert. Also there's a good chance the operation was only approved because Tybur knew of the vow to renounce war. No way they would have sent 10 year old kids to recover the founder had they known the king of the walls was ready to unleash the rumbling.
2. Taking the Founding definitely seems more like a deterrent than a weapon."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sociablenerd126,This episode was truly great. I got chills even and even tense despite knowing what was going to happen.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TurbTheCurb,"Pieck was so cute this episode, I feel like her design was more on point and manga like this episode than previous ones."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JenstenRazer,"Bit disappointing they cut out the whole Willy and Magath scene and Zeke being juxtaposed with Eren in the ‚ÄúI was born into this world‚Äù scene. Still, I very much enjoyed this episode and thought that Mappa did a good job in building up tension. Though the ost for Eren‚Äôs transformation could‚Äôve been better, I don‚Äôt mind it too much because the scene itself was pretty well done. Though I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the addition of soldiers walking down the stairs."
JenstenRazer,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Soldiers were closing in on their location in manga too.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NecroSpace,"complaints about the OST are silly, this is a mass murder that parallels the grim reminder, why would you play epic action music over it? The use of silence before Eren's transformation was great too. That fan made OST is great but gives off a wrong tone for that scene."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Freedom_scenery,"Watching live reaction was such a pain. They all ignored Eren clearly not holding a grudge to Reiner anymore, and that he's doing this because he's forced, And went about yeah Eren wreck them hahaha revenge take that hahaha. god that was unbearable I hope they show deaths next episode in full glory so these people can somewhat understand."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,XNicTigX,"Guys, let's not forget to upvote the ep discussion post on r/anime once eng subs are out! We gotta get this ep breaking karma records!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,leolps,"Declaration of war is definitely better than Warrior in the manga,  but in the anime unfortunately it is not and the most clear reason to me is this fucking fast pace, there is no time to build up like S2 did. It is sad that they decided to do only 16 episodes for  32 chapters it is just not enough"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jeremaya1,"The episode was great BUT it could have been way better , I think the ‚Äúattack on titan exhibition anniversary ‚Äù music and animation was more Impacting and mind-blowing than the anime. But I really wished they used youseeitbiggirl xd or the attack titan ots ."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ASMR-enthusiast,"Great tension in the episode, although I feel like the ending lacked intensity due to the usage of what \[felt\] like stills, combined with an (imo) overdone OST. Still great overall though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Coronarchivista,"Damn, the dialogue between Eren and Reiner (especially the latter‚Äôs breakdown) was this episode‚Äôs highlight for me! 

I was pretty disappointed with the OST for the end as I felt it too bare bones (and that they friggin teased YouSeeBigGirl last episode!!!!) but eh, didn‚Äôt ruin my overall experience with the episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mario61752,Oh my god Yelena‚Äôs VA is creepy

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yingxinhehe,they mentioned and kinda animated the rumbling?? the song oMg and falco and reiner having a shocked of their lives
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Keres513,"We've been waiting for this since 2017, now It's 2021 and the manga is ending in 3 months. In the meanwhile we had countless theories, arguments and top tier memes... Seeing this long awaited episode that mark a serious turn in the story and the anime I can't help but reminisce about how far we've come"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yonatankapi,"I'll won't get to watch the ep for a while, but I was in fear when I heard Zook and Eren parallels were cut because I interupted that as if the iconic ""But I Do Not Wish To Die"" Eren expression was cut as well. Really happy that it was indeed included. We'll see how I fell about 2Volt asI've not watched any scenes yet except ep 6 pv, so I gotta wait. But damn if the Final Shot of the PV was the Mikasa closeup, I'd explode. Hope they manage the upcoming episodes well."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"""Shingeki no Kyojin"" Namedrop on the episode preview haha that's always exciting."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Levis_Ceylon_Company,"Precisely no one asked, but as one who thought it was an incredibly underrated track, 2volt‚Äôs inclusion left me very happy indeed.

Plus the memes it spawned"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LeapingTitan,"Every time I saw someone asking for YouSeeBIGGIRL/T:T in this scene in the past 3 years I lost brain cells faster than the population of the Earth lost numbers during the Rumbling in the manga. Yes, it's a fantastic track and an iconic Attack on Titan piece of music, but it would not fit here. Maybe it fits your own interpretation of the manga and this scene, but that doesn't mean that's exactly how it's going to happen. I think it's okay to criticize things but if you're just turning your hype boner into a blue balls rage boner, no one is gonna bother to respectfully talk with you.

To be completely honest, nothing could have surpassed my expectations for this episode. It was still well done, though.

Also, can we actually stop calling individual pieces of music ""ost""? OST stands for Original Soundtrack, meaning the ENTIRE catalog of music made for a piece of media, not a single piece from it. Call it what it is. Not ""ost"". It's ""track"" or ""theme""."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shiinobu-,"The music choice was great and I understand why people are mad with the last scene OST, it's not what we've been expecting for years, but it is animated well and the music prior was sweet, I liked the episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,leafyyfak,i don‚Äôt understand why people are criticizing the use of music on this ep? i thought it was perfect
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GravityMyGuy,"Wish they used a more sinister ost for when eren attacked. It sounded too triumphant for someone who just said he‚Äôs going to murder innocents.

Edit: Ayyo so if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet someone re-edited it wit the leaked ost [re-edit ](https://youtu.be/yCpF48bLXbg)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chi-han,"I thought the episode was fantastic and had my heart pounding throughout the second half. My boyfriend is anime only and thought the episode was useless because ""nothing happened"" and ""they spent 20 minutes explaining stuff the audience already knew and could have been explained in 5"" how do I prove him wrong in addition to not sucking his dick today

Eta: this comment is meant to be humorous but I don't actually know how to explain the importance of this episode for story development more than what I've already tried. I said that the rest of the world didn't know what we knew so it's important to see their perspective and also its showing us as the audience that the Tyber family WANTS all the Eldians to be extinct, but he had the a u d a c i t y to say some of that could have happened off screen. Like bruh"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarthDeimos6624,I actually liked the music they used.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CherryCokeaine,"Ignoring qualms about the OST and cuts, the nitpicks I've seen about this episode are so weird. You guys cannot be THAT dissapointed about not seeing the crowd...right? Also ""too many stills"" in 2 chapters with 90 percent of it being 2 guys sitting in a basement.  The OST choice is literally making people say the episode was irredeemable trash (mostly /a/) which is hilarious because the chat was fucking loving it right up until that point. I blame fan-edits of the manga lmao."
CherryCokeaine,TheSilverSeraphim,"People are acting like Mappa's a garbage studio over the OST choice like they didn't give WIT the **exact** same shit over Monkey Sushi lol (ironically 2volt played in both scenes too). I'd prefer for the leaked OST to have been used at the ending too, but when I watch the full episode in a few hours, I'm sure I'm gonna love it regardless."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PerplexedJuggernaut,In my opinion Eren's transformation was underwhelming but it's still acceptable; what actually was ruined was Willy's 'Because I was born into this world' and Eren's reaction to it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dapetece,"The ending OST is not for me.

It's weird to say but I get more chills from reading the motion manga @ Youtube lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ClickingHCT,Lmao during then shot of the crowd when Eren transforms a background character just gets absolutely annihilated by debris
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CamaiDaira,The OST was good until the transformation. I don't understand the negativity. Good episode but I feel like we overhyped it a bit too much.
CamaiDaira,PrasantGrg,"> overhyped it a bit too much.

That's an understatement. Fucking hell even the finale of this season hasn't been hyped as much tbh."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JuicyDragonCat,"Episode 54: They're definitely gonna use some hype music for levi vs beast titan right? Nah 2VOLT

Episode 64: We're gonna get some hype music for DOW right? Nah 2VOLT AGAIN

I love 2volt."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nohan97,"All complainig about 2volt but did anyone payed attention to Willy speech??? It was 10√ó better than in the manga, they way he describe the Vow with that OST in the background telling how fritzonly wish was to find peace is amazing. Sad how some just Focus in the OST of the las minute."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vankuree,"While I think the transformation could have been better, and I think Willy had a lot less emotion that I thought he would, I really think the rest of the episode was perfect. The atmosphere in the basement was absolutely perfect, and the way that the audio from the speech changed was really well done. Reiner felt insanely expressive, and his voice actor did the job perfectly. The themes used during Willy's speech were played for a perfect amount of time and were done perfectly as well. 

&#x200B;

I think I'll have to look at what was cut or not to really dictate whether the episode was better or worse than episode 4--which I have thought is the best episode so far."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,The music buildup has me on the verge of a heart attack.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_LadyForlorn,The BGM this episode was so chilling that I had a constant 24 minutes of Goosebumps. They cut the Will Magath exchange but I think that is better. It didn't break the underlying eerie flow of this episode. The final transformation BGM could have been better. Overall 10/10. Now we wait for the sub.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,alisonburgersm8,Can we talk about Yelena and that rumbling shot? Got me so hyped

Also hope Mappa can nail the 3dmg movement."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DARKH0ARSE,idc idc. I LOVE vogel im kafig but this was okay. it ws just as good.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JuicyDragonCat,When I heard 2volt was being used I was really hyped cause I thought they were gonna use the part from when eren sees his memories in the cave and from when hannes is about to get eaten. But they used a completely different part
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThePreciseClimber,"Anyone remember the first version of Willy's speech we got a year and a half ago?

[https://youtu.be/YjroGK-TnVQ](https://youtu.be/YjroGK-TnVQ)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MysticJohn,Apparently the scene at the end with the Marleyans closing in on Eren was in the manga but I don't see it? Can somebody point me to the page where it happens?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JasonTParker,I can't wait to see Eren and the Bois**‚Ñ¢** wipe the floor with the Marlyean scum in the next two episodes :D
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,Mitsuki Saiga  is Yelena VA. She's a singer as well.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Justified_Eren,"I can't stop shaking, please send help"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"Also, I'm really glad they fixed Willy's voice direction for the actual line where he declares war. In the Final Exhibition's motion manga thingy and the PV, it always sounded to me like Willy was having a casual conversation, or just rehearsing his speech in a mirror. Here, it definitely sounded like he was knowingly saying his last words."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,"Just watched the episode. I liked it. The Eren / Reiner convo. felt really short than I remember it being. Maybe because of how the pacing was - but it felt like it ended quick. The Declaration definitely felt a bit flimsy, but the 2VOLT track didn't feel as mismatched as I though it would, reading this thread. Still, the edit on the front page with the unreleased S4 OST would have pushed this into absolute masterpiece status. 

Despite all that, I still think this episode was fantastic. I just wish the pace wasn't so fast. I felt like this was a problem in episode 3 too. It's not about the cut content but rather how much each scene is allowed a chance to breath and truly shine. Moving from one dialogue to the next sort of fails to have that impact on me that it had while I was reading the manga but that may just be me idk. Like I love how they took the Dr. Jaeger flashback in Episode 4 and made it so much more unique. Because that scene was allowed to have more time, I felt way more of an impact from it in the anime than I ever did in the manga. But I guess, the 16 episode limit means we'll definitely have episodes that a bit of a miss."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mr_1ightning,"So, the rumbing is ""Jinarashi"" in Japanese? Sounds epic as fuck ngl"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jj7687,"That was a really good episode, don‚Äôt understand the complaints I saw here earlier"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CaptainAlexU,Really funny to see animeonlys theorize who Yelena is
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,someroastedbeef,"as expected this sub's expectations are way too high. the reception in /r/anime is juicy 

i loved it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mirror_of_Souls,I would've got the declaration of war on my birthday if they released it last week. Hurts man.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BadR0bot,Reiner‚Äôs voice acting made me wanna cry no cap
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,obxsguy,"Thought mappa did a pretty damn good. I'm not gonna list my top 30 tracks I would've used for the transformation scene, but I do agree with the sentiment shared by some on here that another song would've been better.


That said I still loved it and the rest of the episode was absolutely fantastic. One thing I will note though is that Willy and Magath's talk before the event was missing. Not too big of a deal but it also provides some insight on Willy's mindset on the whole issue. Guess it's not really needed anymore and idk where they could fit it in. 

Oh and the preview of the warhammer got me all hyped up. I think next week is gonna be the real test on how well these cgi versions of the titans hold up during action sequences. But so far, mappa has done an excellent job imo"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DoItNowMikasa,Taking bets on Armin‚Äôs transformation. Will there be a close-up of the pain on his face as he removes his hood? Or a panned out shot.
DoItNowMikasa,Everdale,"They did show the pained close-up in the trailer, so I'm hoping they use it. It's a pretty iconic manga panel."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dragon6105,"I think the reason why some people felt underwhelmed by this episode is due to all the fan variations we‚Äôve seen throughout these past years. For example, I love listening to electricmercury‚Äôs fan dubs for the series (if you haven‚Äôt seen his videos go check them out, they‚Äôre so good!) and thus I was used to his version of the declaration of war scene. When I was watching the episode, I felt a little underwhelmed by Willy‚Äôs speech and erens conversation with Reiner because I was so used to the fan made version where there the pacing was a lot slower and there were more breaks between the dialogue.

However, now that I‚Äôve rewatched the scene a couple more times, I‚Äôm actually enjoying the scene a lot more and I‚Äôm liking the lack of music during erens conversation and then 2volt during the transformation."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Runningman0301,"Kinda sad how the Reiner burrito Annie flashback at the start of the ep
Got completely overshadowed"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Otheagony,"And it all comes full circle. The moment when you hear the Colossal Titans theme from the first episode you know what's about to happen, and Reiner's dread at the realisation makes it all the more impactful. Throughout the first half you can sense the buildup, in the music and the different chain of events starting to kick off. The play itself serves as good buildup whilst at the same time giving us the exposition to why the start of the series happened, and now that we know why the first attack on the walls happened all those years ago, we now ask why Eren is about to attack Marely and ho it came to this moment.

Another point I liked is how throughout the episode, Eren just looked dead in the eyes, no emotion, nothing, they were bland and you could barely see his pupil, whereas Reiner, Falco and everyone else on Marely, had eyes so full of life, again drawing parrallels to the first episode. But what makes it even more frightening is that we only see life and emotion in Erens eyes once he talks once more about destroying his enemies. This time, he isn't saying it off to the distance or to himself, he's doing so whilst looking directly into his enemies eyes. He's now reached the moment he always talked about, and he knows it, but somehow we can barely tell what he's feeling, after seeing him get so angry, so emotional about talking about this goal of his back on Paradis, when you see him say it now, so bluntly and without emotion, you know that the Eren we know is gone, all that's left is a machine of pure will and destruction.

In a nutshell. Worth the wait."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jake1718,This was amazing.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raknel,üòé 3 episodes until the Gabster enters the scene üòé
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,abbacchioz,Damn Ereh really is the Jaegerbomb after all
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,"okay upon rewatching for the 10th time i can confirm that the declaration of war was

#EPIC."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fullmetal-ghoul,"OK having rewatched with headphones and on my own this time I take back basically all my criticism, wish I watched it that way the first time. It really made me appreciate the tense atmosphere a lot more and the declaration was perfect honestly given the more subdued overall tone of the episode (which I mean in a good way). The fansubs were a lot better as well. 

I still think the scene where Eren essentially forgives Reiner and then Reiner breaks down could've been a bit more powerful but otherwise it was a pretty flawless adaptation. One of the best episodes I've ever seen for sure"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,N1COLAS13,Eren just blasted an entire building of innocent people and y'all want hype music on the scene lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OtakuKing613,"Haven't watched it yet but will come back tomorrow after the whiney hissy fit comments are pushed to the bottom. Seriously, some of you guys need help."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chocothunderboi,Am I the only one who thought the OST they chose for the ending was a good choice. It wasn‚Äôt what I expected but I think it still fit the atmosphere pretty well
chocothunderboi,cidalkimos,They did the same with levi vs beast. They‚Äôll get over it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,someroastedbeef,"they used 2volt? now i'm even more hype, youseegirl doesn't fit"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Diavalo_,"The episode was SO SO SO near perfection, honestly I think OST is about 75% of hype in transformation scenes, they missed a great opportunity to make the ep a 10/10. 

BUT WE MOVE"
Diavalo_,arafatnabi,Shouldve removed the opening to add more time for buildup to transformation. The standup Reiner scene shouldve been longer with some other ost.
arafatnabi,Diavalo_,"Yeah it was really abrupt, which is kinda cool in a way. I think the Anime onlies will appreciate it more than the difficult to please manga readers haha."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RelatablePopcornFire,"I really loved the music that played throughout the whole episode up until Eren's transformation. That delivered and intensified the tension in that basement, which is what I want an anime to do - improve on the manga using its unique strengths.

However the rest of the episode felt like a slight downgrade from the manga, like every shot is 90% of the quality of the manga panel. Way too many jarring jumps between scenes, the crowd responded quite weakly to Willy's emotions and he himself didn't deliver enough emotion into the line ""But I don't want to die"".

I also am not a fan that Reiner was mostly a bit more confident in the anime and that they didn't show the people in the building as Eren transformed, killing them. Those were decisions, not lack of effort or skill. But I don't understand these choices.

Overall, not a bad episode, but I hoped for much more."
RelatablePopcornFire,ProfessorDipshit_3,"Man tbh reiners VA did an astounding job to portray his breakdown, and they didnt show those people getting killed due to censorship. Its always been in the anime, but i agree that willys speech left me rather unsatisfied"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jwaters0122,"next ep going to be so epic when they see Eren saying ""Now Mikasa!"" as she blows up the WT's nape. anime onlies gon go nuts"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IIToxSickII,"Lol this thread is just gonna be filled with YOUSEEBIGGIRL stans isn't it. Listen, jut because it worked for Reiner transformation, doesn't mean it fits every situation."
IIToxSickII,shibboleth2005,"I think it would be a bad choice but I did want more HYPE. I think what people really want is the feeling of the R&B reveal, even if they're misguidedly asking for the exact music."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Boondrewd,My main problem is the impact. I felt more impact from eren looking at the ocean than the Declaration of war...On the whole world
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BolondEmber,"In defense of the OST used.I've watched both the original and the edited final scenes at least ten times now and I have to say, I prefer the original.  
To be fair, the edits with YouSeeBIGGIRL and all the leaked OST are a lot more \*epic\*. But the main character killing hundreds of thousants of innocent people is not \*epic\*.  
The OST used puts a lot more ephasis on the moment Eren's hand starts glowing, saying 'Oh shit, he's about to commit a war crime' instead of 'LET'S GOOOO DECLARATION OF WAR EPIC EPIC EPIC'.  
Let me remind all of you, that for anime onlies, this is the first time seeing Eren with his less heroic traits. The music makes that moment a lot more shocking."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seasalt-and-oranges,"I watched the edit with the trailer OST, and I like both versions in their own way.

The trailer OST fits very well to the moment where titan Eren jumps out from the building. It makes the scene very ‚Äúepic‚Äú.

I do also like the silence in the actual episode though. The music stops just after Eren smiles and reaches his hand out to Reiner. If you are an anime-only, it makes you think until the very last moment that maybe, Eren will just make peace with Reiner lol.
The suddenness of what is about to happen gets lost in the ‚Äúepic‚Äú edit, since you can already hear the music rising.

Not sure if I am a big fan of 2volt in that scene though. It does fit well animation wise, I just think it sounds a little too heroic for what is happening. I'm interested in what OST they'll use next episode while Eren runs amok."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"My anime-only friend told me he just saw a still of Eren's titan from this episode, so I told him that it's from the preview and that he doesn't transform in this episode.

I hope I'm being a good friend right now."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,solarfall79,"I kind of wish there was a little more motion during those last shots and that they'd kept the Willy-Magath scene in, but overall I thought it was a great adaptation. The complaining I read on here earlier, especially in regards to the music, is laughable. Christ, guys."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSilverSeraphim,"Yeah I genuinely do think people knowing what's going to happen is a big reason why so many people have qualms with this episode. We all know that Eren's gonna transform and kill Willy, but going into it blind it's easy to see that they're setting it up so you have no clue what Eren's gonna do, especially given that for once he ain't yelling or speaking angrily at Reiner or Falco. ""Is he really gonna transform and kill all those innocents, especially given how much he hated Reiner and Bertholdt for 'being mass murderers' in the past? It seems like Eren forgave Reiner and the Warriors over what they did in the past.""

Watching the full episode reaffirms my belief that YouSeeBigGirl would have been an awful choice, and even then I don't think the leaked OST would work as well as people think if that's the mood the studio was trying to convey. Woulda been nice to have a different track outside of 2volt though cuz I def think it feels too ""heroic(?)"" per say given, y'know, this marks where Eren fully committed to activating the Rumbling and he's committing terrorism lmao.

Def was a great episode either way though imo"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KarlKrabit,"You guys are kinda crybabys, that episode was a 10/10. This was a somber, painful episode for eren, reiner, and willy. It was all dialogue. Why would they use youseebiggirl? Thats for next episodes buds!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shnooka,Erens titan looks truly terrifying
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bluthbanana88,aw what a tease‚Äîthey‚Äôre really building up for us to see the survey corps finally animated. gahhhhh i‚Äôm so excited for the new character designs finally get animated
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,blehbleh2332,"Great episode but i can see where the complains are coming from. Personally i feel like the 'Eren Jeager' name-dropt moment was a bit underwhelming, the close-up frame in the manga was probably more fitting for such a dramatic scene. Also the static Attack titan is still vastly better then the CGI one lol. Really interesting to see how they handle the Warhammer-Attack fight and the obligatory HYPE as per usual."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_LadyForlorn,r/anime post has crossed 20K karma in 14 hours. Previous record was 20.3K karma in 48 hours for season 4 ep 1. Speaks volume how anime onlies has taken this episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,"I enjoy reading anime only threads because they actually talk about the story,characters,... etc . It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air which is worrying. When I come across manga threads, all I see is ost,character design,eyes,color palette,blur , blah blah blah. Since when people here became expert animators. If you don‚Äôt like the adaptation, then make a better one. Even anime onlys are sick of these crybabys and their experience are getting hindered by such dumb complaints. I also saw people tagging staff to replace the ost .Just sad how this fandom has been reduced to."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Justified_Eren,Chapters 99-105 are the best piece of fiction that I've ever experienced. After months of build-up and hype in Marley Arc there goes the reward.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JustSomeone_in-here,Omfg I haven't seen the episode yet and this replies are scaring me with how split they are.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,clickseeker,"good episode, 2volt was good but didn't expect it too much, still very solid.

also, for everyone complaining about the ost; it was all about expectation. we always automatically fit that scene with /T:T or the Trailer OST so we built false expectations and encased our brains in a hollow coccoon. be more open minded. it was still good."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,victor_emperor,"This should‚Äôve topped ep 6 in s2 but the choice of music really didn‚Äôt fit the thing, really a shame because the whole episode was just pure perfection, if only the music at the end could‚Äôve been better..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Crisisofland,Attack Titan looks especially vicious now goddamn
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ClickingHCT,Can‚Äôt wait for next week next episode is going to fucking fire and hopefully it will show the magnitude of the battle to come. It should flow better and I think Eren‚Äôs entrance will be better suited to having actual action along with it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,"Ngl, the transformation is still pretty hype lol. It‚Äôs not what I envisioned but I‚Äôm always open to new ideas."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TurtleTycoon,"I wish they devoted more time on animating Eren‚Äôs expressions, I feel like a lot was lost there but I‚Äôm still mostly satisfied overall. Reiners breakdown in particular was done so excellently, props to his voice actor."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FullMetalCaterpillar,"Not watching the episode until much later today, but I didn‚Äôt listen to the leaked OST on YouTube or expect to hear Youseebiggirl or anything that I thought fit perfectly. When I saw people on here getting so super hyped listening to their favorite ost or the leaked ost while imagining the scene in the their heads, I knew some people were gonna feel really disappointed when the real thing finally came out. Better to go into it with lowered or no expectations at all. That being said, I can‚Äôt wait to watch later! üòÅ"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kingmacaw,this is the most important moment of my life. nobody touch me. im not ready
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ISHIPMYPANTS,"this was a great episode and everything don't get me wrong, but i felt like something was missing. not sure if it was the pacing or the music but to me something was missing"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,holy shit amazing episode. I cant believe Im finally seeing this masterpiece animated!!! I LIVED TO SEE THIS!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mericberktas,I liked the episode overall. The transformation was a bit disappointing though.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,euphraxiaaa,"BOYS IMAGINE A new variant of YSBG like Apple Seed but for Eren, IMAGINE A NEW OST FOR EREN.. the build up, the tension, the suspense would be even better.... for real... AND THE HYPE WOULD BE EVEN GODLY..."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vsifsz,"I wanted the ""I dont want to die... Because I was born into this world"" and the Eren eye opening thing to be more dramatic tbh. Also I feel like the soldiers were unnecessary. Aside from those and the questionable soundtrack choices, good episode."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lefseman92,Watched the full episode now. Epic stuff.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Revolutionary-Jump91,"Next Episode is the first Titan vs Titan Fight, and it will probably set the stage for how they will look for the rest of the season, so let's hope it's done well"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EsseDiElle13,"I see more people complaining about other people complaining about the music than actual people complaining about the music. But I understand why people complaining about the music would cause other people to complain about those complaining, I'm not complaining though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hotstop42,"Already seeing complaints about the use of OST during the transformation scene. I think some manga readers had very, very high expectations for this episode and that ruined their overall experience. All in all, I think this episode is still a great adaptation. Looking forward for anime-onlies to experience this and the next ones"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,natdetton,"I feel people tend to complain about the osts used for certain scenes but usually I feel it‚Äôll age well. Just look at Levi vs beast Titan, people were disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt a over the top hype sound track, but looking back now 2volt really fit the intensity of the scene."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,kinda disappointed when reading this thread. the soundtrack placement must‚Äôve really upset you guys lol. i get it but personally the transformation doesn‚Äôt drown out 20 minutes of kino.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Phortieniyn,"Remember when people were upset about the scene of Levi wrecking Zeke in S3P2 because the music wasn't 'epic' enough? Seems familiar to me right now, idk"
Phortieniyn,Kerim44,This is EXACTLY what is happening right now. I couldn't fathom back then that there were people acting like WIT killed their parents or something because ost wasn't up to their tastes. There wasn't even any music when Eren cut down Bertolto and the episode still got the highest ranking out of any season.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Meltedsteelbeam,They should have played the Frosty the Snowman song instead during the transformation üò° Terrible adaptation
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,altfeb7,"Fuck! My favorite scene....

They did everything right until the most important moment..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shookhammy,"Eren's eyes lit up before transforming was goosebumps-worthy, the new soundtrack, and Reiner's slow mo turn towards Falco was a good additional imo. MAPPA keeps delivering and it gets better and better each episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LifeButBetter,HOLY FUCK BRO BEFORE EREN TRANSFORMED HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS GOING SUPER SAIYAN. AND WHY THE FUCK IS HIS TITAN SO MUCH SCARIER GODDAMN IM HYPED FOR THE NEXT EP
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Are people downplaying it so those watching it with subtitles later have even better experience?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WithinEternity6,Seems like people hate 2volt. Why? It‚Äôs not a bad track. I understand that majority wanted youseebiggirl but that track was for Reiner and Bert. I don‚Äôt want to say I kept my expectations low but this episode was well done in my opinion.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,edwinvi,bro idc what anyone says that shit was hype
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GBEPanzer,"Funny how I've read every single Sawano track from the past seasons in the comments as a better alternative. It's as if people have their favorite songs and just wanna see whatever they like the most and fuck everyone else. No matter which song they chose for the scene, the situation would be exactly the same."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tseriel,The way Reiner‚Äôs voice actor stole the show despite Willy talking for most of the episode üò©
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,danidohhh,"Everyone talking about the music (which even though it‚Äôs not my favorite choice they could‚Äôve made is FINE), and I even like the ‚Äúdusty‚Äù scene which looks like the stage has just been hit with a bomb.

But I think the biggest miss of the ending is not showing the family watching from the window right as Eren is transforming. Isayama definitely put that in focus and it really gave me chills at the time I read the chapter since it really made me think ‚Äúwhat the fuck did Eren just do, this is not him‚Äù. Really does make you feel like something fucked up is happening

Too bad :("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crimsonsecret7,"Bru this way no other studio wanted to adapt season 4

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fuvkutonpa,"Amazing episode, I started tearing up when reiner broke down and got on his knees. After seeing the edit on this sub with the OST I felt like the edit was better, but I still thought it was rly good when I was watching it. Im guessing they just didnt want to overuse the OST too much."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Patrick4356,"I dont think they made it clear enough thG king fritz was a genocidal pacifist. They cut the line ""if all eldians were to be killed, I would accept it"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,It's confirmed people in the fandom have an addiction. They fapped too many times to YSBG.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thedabbo,"When I see people complaining about the ost and saying it could be better, I imagine they are the same people that is saying the cgi complainers are way to dramatic."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GowtherETC,Here for r/titanfolk nitpicking the hell out of this like always
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TypicalPnut,I dont care what any of you OST junkies say. That was one of the greatest pieces of media I've ever seen and the music was absolutely perfect. My heart was racing the entire time and I wouldn't trade that song for the world..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PM_ME_AWESOME_SONGS,"Are people still allowed to dislike something or do they have to say that everything Mappa does is always perfect? Of course there are stupid critics, but behaving like nothing can be ever changed for better is stupid as well.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WithinEternity6,No hate on soul madness but he gave manga readers high expectations of the ending scene which I think has ruined their experience. What was supposed to be a very hype moment is being criticized as trash because of a damn ost choice. Makes me kinda sad...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,serrations_,"0/10 Mapaapa failed us. I cant believe they didnt use ""Dj Hi Tek Rulez"" for the final secene."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fayiner,"Friendly reminder: MAPPA is an animation house, they don't choose de OST, that's the director job."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Martin7431,"the build up was fucking amazing, it was literally anxiety inducing. i feel kind of let down by the ending, though. it felt they werent sure how to animate it so they just did a slide show of the manga panels?

overall, probably still my favourite episode so far, at least the first half"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ViperJoe,"The biggest disappointment to me is that they didn't show the panel with Zeke which is meant to juxtapose his and Eren's ideologies. It's not a deal-breaker or anything, but it is a pretty neat bit of foreshadowing for the upcoming arc. Great episode overall, though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HistoriaTheFirst,"I thought you guys were all being way too nitpicky when I heard that you guys didn‚Äôt like the ending of the episode because of the OST but now that I‚Äôve seen it, I üíØ agree that the ending was like ‚Äúoh, ok‚Äù for me. 

The rest of the episode was bangin tho. If I had to give it a rating, it‚Äôd be like 8/10. 

Also, a little disappointed that the OP isn‚Äôt adding stuff as the episodes progress.  I still love the OP song and imagery overall, but wish it did more."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chokkolate,"The best episode yet, mostly because of the seiyuu. Outstanding performance from Eren's, Reiner's, Falco's and Willy's voice actors. The OST could be better, though. But that's a problem with the entire season until now. It's not that it is bad...it's just...lacking. Not goosebump inducing, just...ok. In other episodes it's not such a big deal, but this was THE episode, the climax of this arc."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,emmennuel,After 3 years of waiting. The episode is so good.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,blueracoon21,"Episode was great. The declaration could have been a masterpiece to top Bert & Reiner's reveal considering the source they're working on, but it was just okay. IMO all it need is just better pacing and spaces between dialogue (especially the transition from Willy's speech to Reiner's breakdown). They could have not added the soldiers searching for eren and let the dialogue flow as it is. Although, I have to agree that manga readers have played this scene differently in their mind, of course there will be disappointment. The flow of the chapter in the manga is soooo perfectly drawn.

The ost will grow on me as I continue to rewatch this, but the edited version with the fan-made ost is the headcanon for me lol. At least Eren's sorrowful and accepting smile is there at the end, that's the key development in this chapter. All in all, great episode. So much could have gone wrong in the animation other than the ost, but they made it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nowveidn,"Just a thought... if i were anime only and i watched this episode i would be hella pissed if isayama doesnt show the rumbling happening later like you cant just tease us with this very interesting plot potential and call it a day.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kuahkacang,I guess the reason why they didn't put YSBG (or the new fanmade OST) in the last scene is that the music transition between the final scene and the ending song would sound kinda awkward (its only like 30 seconds or 20 seconds if u start the chorus the same moment as the attack titan appears - unlike Reiner and Berthold reveal) unless they replace the ending song and put movie-like credit and continue the YSBG theme...

I believe they didn't use the more dramatic music early on because it would let people know that eren was gonna transform.
If they re do the scene next episode they should use the more appropriate music."

Somehow the anime fail to capture the essence of the manga when Reiner and Eren was talking to each other and this is very important! Manga Eren feel sympathetic to Willy and Reiner whereas the anime Eren feel like a evil or bad person.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,"2Volt worked perfectly for the ending, overreacting asses. My absolute only problem with the episode was the lack of emphasis on ""Because I was born into this world."" I always imagined it as a sweeping line, that he lets the audience really savor and take in, making them think about the deep implications of such a simple phrase. Maybe his voice tremors at the end as he says world, because he knows that he is mere moments from his death. Maybe the most important line of the speech apart from the actual declaration.

Instead it felt more like a throwaway line, that you maybe aren't meant to feel the weight of without knowing it's a callback. Eren's reaction was good and let the casual viewer know it wasn't just a throwaway line, but damn I honestly was really disappointed in it. Actually maybe my biggest disappointment with the season so far, assuming the Willy/Magath carriage chat gets put back in. I guess I sort of wish they had focused on Eren's face when Willy mentioned going to war with Paradis, because it's the moment he knew for certain that his future memories were set in stone, and why he and Zeke hadn't yet touched in the first place. But the reaction itself was fine and everyone caught it."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,emmennuel,High expectations lead to high disappointment. Just saying.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raknel,"Great episode, but the music didn't fit at all at the end"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BasedKenpachi,"This episode was good, but I have some critiques. The focus is mostly on Willy's speech, which draws away from the center of the episode going on between Eren and Reiner. When Willy says ""Eren Yaeger,"" he was supposed to SCREAM IT, or at least make it have some sort of significance in production, instead it got mixed down and filtered to where it lost all intensity. The OST used when Eren transforms is not very fitting in my opinion, I would've liked something more dramatic. Additionally on Eren's transformation, the animation was mostly stills, which was a little disappointing. They decided to add in soldiers storming the basement for some reason, I'm assuming to make the anime-only fans feel like Eren *had* to transform and had no other choice, when it was really his plan all along. This just adds confusion, frankly, because people who haven't read the manga will read Eren's intentions incorrectly. It was a good episode, but it could've been better.

EDIT: The art looked amazing, Eren and Reiner's voice actors really went in"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OzzyOutrage,"Christ, this fanbase is never fucking happy I swear. I thought the episode was really well directed, seeing Willy's play animated really helped bring the whole event alive and I loved the tension just before Eren transformed. Honestly I'm glad the music wasn't the main focal point before Eren transformed, it allowed the tension in the room to breathe just like syringebowl. I love the leaked ost but it rarely gets quiet and quite honestly would have made the scene chaotic instead of the calm before the storm it is."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pythism,Wow japanese fans are vocal about the new episode and they are not happy. Theyre discontented with the OST choices and the cuts from the manga. I guess they were holding out hope for YouSeeBIGGIRL. There's even a petition that's garnered thousands of signatures to have the OST changed. Obviously that wont happen but it shows how unhappy they are.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Viviiiieeee_96,"Love how titanfolk turned the OST complaints into a new meme. 

Anyways, I liked episode. The tension buildup was just wonderful, and even I, who knows what will happen, is getting nervous. The OST disappointing people is an odd complaint, but I believe that this quiet background noise of 2volt fits the scene more than YSBG. I was kinda disappointed at first, but the more I rewatch, the better it gets.

Now, time for my personal fangirling about voice actors and actresses essay. Reiner's VA (Yoshimasa Hosoya) captured his emotions well. I could really feel that he was guilty and regretful of his actions to Paradis Island. And Yuki Kaji... He nailed the calm Eren voice very well. It just felt like Eren aggressively guilt tripping Reiner in the basement scene like the manga but more intense. Also Falco's VA was pretty great too.

I also wanna comment on Pieck's scream while falling down the hole. It's really cute lmao. And then Yelena's voice actress was amazing, her voice (probably lowered down to fit Yelena's disguise) was not exactly the one in my head, but it feels great seeing her voice acted.

yeahhhhh that's it, also one of the guys in panzer unit look like the guy in the chad meme. probably the chin"

Would Eren still get the titan if he drank the spinal fluid mid-air or having the spinal fluid exposed to oxygen render it useless (and thus, the Titan would go to a random Eldian baby). Is there a 5-second rule to Eldian spinal fluids when it comes to titan inheritance?!"
Everdale,v_a_ibhav,"Are you an anime only? If yes, then stay away from this subreddit because you will be spoiled since this is a manga subreddit and we post untagged spoilers."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gotnonameforthis,"To lessen the complaints a bit, I'm just gonna say i would've loved the season 4 trailer ost for the scene but it's still a 10/10 from me"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheMaggotJoe,Big F for that person behind Ogweno
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,purpleglass26,"I‚Äôve never quite wrapped my mind around this. 

Why did Willy wait all this time and come out with this information only now?

How did Willy or his spies know that Eren wants to use the founder to release the colossals?

What was Willy‚Äôs point in declaring war if he knew that it would result in an attack on everyone in Liberio? He had no reason to believe anything bad would happen if he just left things to the status quo.

Zeke‚Äôs plan (even if it was a lie) was to reclaim the founding Titan to deter the world from attacking Marley. He tells the warriors that the Tyburs will narrate ... something ... so they can do that. What was he even talking about?

Can anyone please answer those questions? This is just confusing to me."
purpleglass26,light_bow,"-The tybur‚Äôs were allowing the people of Paradis to live in their fake paradise until Marley attacked, as per King Fritz final request
-Because eren is not of royal blood, he isn‚Äôt bound by the vow and therefore he is a huge unknown and a huge risk. I‚Äôm sure Reiner explained what he is like to them as well. The rumbling was an empty threat they could ignore until he stole the founder, but now it‚Äôs not and they need to do something about it 
-Willy knew eren would attack if there were a lot of important people there, and that those important people dying would also make the rest of world motivated to unite against Paradis.
-Willy‚Äôs narrates the true history to make the world understand how much of a threat Eren is. Now that they know about the vow and that King Fritz was actually good, they have context to understand why eren is so dangerous and why it‚Äôs so important they reclaim the founder"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NatrenSR1,"Good episode. Again, I feel like I‚Äôm in the minority of people who aren‚Äôt the biggest fan of MAPPA‚Äôs animation and art, but that doesn‚Äôt stop this from being a really solid adaptation."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ham__solo,Can someone please remind me of the significance of Pieck calling out to the Panzer unit?
ham__solo,Blume_Sama,Pretty sure she tells them she finds the guard suspicious
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sensitive-Industry61,So Reiner or Eren?Who do you sympathize the most with?
Sensitive-Industry61,Garryg223,"Reiner for sure. I think Reiner realizes the full gravity of actions and how truly fucked the world around him is. I think Eren realizes this too, but I can empathize a lot more with a child soldier who now desperately wants to die due to his actions than a dude who now wants complete genocide. They both realize how fucked up everything is, and they both realize that there are good people on both sides, but I can empathize with reiner‚Äôs wants more than Eren‚Äôs."
Garryg223,Sensitive-Industry61,"I definitely think Reiner is the better character.I‚Äôd have to go with eren I mean ,his life was literally destroyed for unknown cause being blamed for things he didn‚Äôt know existed.It‚Äôs not like he wants a genocide because he hates them.It‚Äôs because they,the whole world literally wants his people dead.Eren was also a child when he saw his mother get eaten by a titan,It‚Äôs like comparing existential trauma"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,piffaccount5000,"Masterful episode. Even after reading the manga and knowing everything that will happen... I'm still fuckin hooked. Animation perfect, dialogue perfect, music incredible, execution perfect. I have no doubts with MAPPA. Now all that has to happen is Isayama delivers the ill ending and this whole project will be 5 star chef's kiss."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSealTamer,I‚Äôm going to be completely honest...IMO this episode was dope and the best of the season so far. Like others I‚Äòm not a fan of the OST choice for the declaration. Even the part of the OST they used wasn‚Äôt the best part they could have used. It made what should have been one of the most memorable moments in the entire show into just a really good moment but everything else was great. I love how ‚Äúscary‚Äù Mappa is making Eren‚Äôs Titan look.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,waranghira,"So in AV format, we'll never think beard-kun is Jean with that voice. Plus the short face and lighter blonde."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tazzure,"Leaked OST would have been hype. The direction they went with seemed to take the scene more seriously than dramatically. At least, that‚Äôs what I gathered since the low tempo and volume music gave way to really hear the dialogue well. I‚Äôm interested to see if the hype angle is chosen for next week."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ok_Ad_9592,OH MY REINER'S VOICE ACTING IS SO EMOTIONAL AND GOOD AHHH
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,heartbreakhill,"The amount of people in the anime-only thread wondering who the tall soldier is, and thinking it's Armin..

Boy are they in for a ride"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AvalancheZ250,"Amazing episode, as expected. The critical parts were all well done. I thought that some of Reiner's voice lines should have been more exasperated, but that's just a perfect scenario I was envisioning in my head and tbh the MAPPA adaptation was 10/10 anyhow. 

I'm really miffed that Willy and Magath's carriage conversation was skipped though. That convo was extremely important in (further) humanising Willy, humanising Magath, and providing a concrete reason for why the brass of the Marlyean military and tons of diplomats were purposely packed together. It would also reveal that Willy knew he would likely die. 

Maybe the next episode will have the carriage convo as the prelude, and with Willy ending the conversation alluding to the fact that he expects to die. Then, cut straight to a wounded Lady Tybur climbing out of the rubble, thanking Willy for having done his duty -> cue epic transformation music."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Good-Ad-9542,"So, no way they can cover the entire manga at this rate, right?  i mean, we only have 11 episodes. I don't see how it's possible, which means the anime will end differently. But, i see nothing about this online so im confused."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daimyojosh,"If Magath and Willy both suspected they might get attacked that night, then why was all of Marley's top brass present at the declaration of war? Wouldn't they be prime targets for any potential attacker? I know that Willy practically wanted to be martyred, but did the rest of Marley's generals really have to die there?"
daimyojosh,H-K_47,"> why was all of Marley's top brass present at the declaration of war?

That was part of the point. They want the current top brass to get wiped out so Magath can replace them and lead the country in a better direction."
H-K_47,daimyojosh,"Ah I see what you're talking about. Chapter 100, Willy says if Marley top brass + Willy + hundreds of Eldians get killed, then Magath gets to rebuild the army to his choosing and the rest of the world will rally against Paradis.

However, even Magath was hesitant to do such a thing. Rereading this chapter I see Magath also partook in the repeated AOT theme: sacrificing others to try and save lives."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TomatoJuiceFangirl,Why is this only 90% upvoted. That's a lot of downvotes.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,positivebee2,I‚Äôm not ready to see Udo and Zofia next episode :(

general_accoubi,Shadowbringers,"Most people here pirate the manga and the anime, so really who cares about their input, it‚Äôs irrelevant"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,q_uo,"I think one of the reasons I dislike the way MAPPA handled the end of this episode is because of the direction. The perspective too narrow and they butchered [this glorious panel](https://imgur.com/a/mSXmRb3) into this [dusty, unclear abomination](https://imgur.com/a/Xh5SzjO). It's like literally they cut half of the panel and then colored it and put it in the episode. You can't see his body or head or even hand in this perspective amidst the dust. That panel was critical to the ambiance of the scene and it's gone. Poof."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,penguins2946,"Do you know what's kinda funny? The music picked for literally the entire episode outside of the Eren transformation scene was downright fantastic. Just so good, especially during Willy's speech. But man, the music just didn't work for me for Eren's transformation. It didn't seem right.

Still a hell of an episode, tho. I liked the detail of Eren's eyes jumping a bit when he heard Willy say ""because I was born into this world""."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Siomai_God,Can someone help me understans why ppl hate mappa?

Lrekkk,BOFADeeznu1345,These 4chan losers keep ruining every single community on here man
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,not_a_pyschopath,Wow japanese fans are vocal about the OST and they are not happy. They're discontented with the way the music fit the scene and the whole of Eren's transformation. I guess they were holding out hope for a youseebiggirl route. There's even a petition that's garnered thousands of signatures to have the OST changed. Obviously that wont happen but it shows how unhappy they are.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,say_ruh,Um why are people complaining about the music? I thought this episode was fucking dope. Did people get way too attached to one OST and can't accept the episode without it? lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daddy_Kush,Ngl I think the eren smashing the stage scene wasn‚Äôt good it all felt like a still image
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NorthShell,"This was a solid 8/10 episode, I noticed that the animation wasn't at its best in some moments but given how action heavy the next two episodes are going to be Mappa must have put their priorities there.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OnlyCheekyBanter,"Soulmadness has literally ruined some of the anime for me. His choice of music for certain scenes were literally too perfect, particularly his edit of chapters 99 & 100. Nevertheless, this was a great episode, but my expectations were too high."
OnlyCheekyBanter,Final-Solid,"Motion manga is way more easier to use your favorite tracks with because the pacing can be whatever and you don‚Äôt have to worry about syncing voice over. If you think about it, storyboarding anime isn‚Äôt quite easy."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nicktsann,"Animation wise there isn't too much to say, many still images but expected from a dialogue driven episode. 

The atmosphere was top notch, you could feel the tension in the air. My only problem was the warriors cut, it felt kinda weird without the soldier getting them of the audience first. 

OST was pretty good throughout the episode until the end. It felt kinda hollow. 

Can't wait to see again with subs to have my final thoughts on it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,seasalt-and-oranges,When I learned that they didn't use the leaked OST... I was... disappointed...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"Episode was really great as a whole, and the music choice for the dialogue stuff was way better than what I expected, easily 10/10 there. 

Again with 2Volt subverting our expectations, huh? It's not a bad fit, and it worked especially well with the soldiers breaching the basement (which was a really cool detail for MAPPA to add), but man. Like, after rewatching, I still think the scene is really good and really well done, but it easily could've been a lot better. MAPPA had to have known what caliber of song readers were expecting, so I just, like, *really* wanna sit down with whoever made the decision to use 2Volt and just ask them why.

Still a 10/10 episode and the scene is still amazing; anyone who says it's flatout bad is honestly having a kneejerk reaction. Despite having read this chapter probably thirty times, my heart was still pumping when Eren transformed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,it‚Äôs great MAPPA decided to adapt 100 as its own episode. for that i am forever thankful. i was very worried about the potential pacing issues. but makes sense given how the rest of Marley arc are mostly action pieces.
5437354724,sharethebear1,This episode was 99 and 100 though.
sharethebear1,5437354724,crap now i feel like an idiot. that makes the pacing even more impressive for how much dialogue there was!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SomeRandomGuy33,"What?? The episode wasn't exactly how I imagined and overhyped it in my head????

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-yeseen-,"Great episode 9/10 my only complaints are 

1-the soundtrack when Eren transformed was         underwhelming

2-i'm sad that they cut that scene between Magath and Willy it was really important and it gave depth to their characters"
-yeseen-,jwaters0122,they might add that carriage scene in the beginning of the next episode. & that's if the final part of the ep is mikasa blowing up the WT nape. should be enough time
-yeseen-,Zan_tgg,"lmao in titanfolk the only comments I can see are how the ost was underwhelming, while in r/anime they're losing their shit over how hype that moment was."
-yeseen-,Prussian_SMNWGLT,"I think it's good for pacing tho, Willy is not the most present character in the story, developing him is definetly 'optional'."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NotBurgerKing11,"Imma be real, why did sawano bother to make other songs smh, just use Youseeslightlyaboveaverageheightfemale every episode smh i can't believe it all this time and effort are wasted creating other songs, Youseeslightlyaboveaverageheightfemale is clearly the only ost needed by aot. Someone, Anyone please remake all the soundtracks from season 1 to season 4 to only Youseeslightlyaboveaverageheightfemale. I can't stand this effort given out by Mappa And Wit for that matter any other studios could have done the adaptaion justice üòîüòî"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,miskyop,"Unfortunately I can‚Äôt say this episode was better than Hero or the basement episodes. Everything was perfectly adapted don‚Äôt get me wrong but where the fuck is Sawano?! The music was so anticlimactic. Eren‚Äôs transformation was sloppy and I wish they‚Äôd stuck to 2D for that one scene but whatever.

The tension in this episode was off the charts. Hats off to Kaiji and Reiner‚Äôs VA."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JYLWC,"I hope Mappa can focus more on character expressions. The drawing of emotions of anime characters are really not as good as manga, and everything else is good."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mohwi,"People are underplaying the weight of the scene as a whole just to excuse the misplacing of the OST, no one overhyped this episode it's already crazy enough, the right OST would have elevated the anime experience to the next level though, and that's what we manga readers have been waiting for"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RoseOfStardust,"Honestly gonna take whats said here with a grain of salt, since r/titanfolk is the biggest complainer out of the SnK subreddits. First the chapter, now the episode, I guess some of yall will never be happy in your lives"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,N1COLAS13,YOUSEEBIGGIRL does not fit the scene *at all*. The scene was great but imo the best version possible was the one currently on the frontpage with the trailer's music

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sotterof1995,Kaji's performance was perfect. I liked the inclusion of the Marleyans finding Eren. Track selection at the last scene was disappointing. I didn't mind the still images at all. 9/10
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nadiahzulkifli,"Anybody complained about the music yet?

Edit: nevermind, they're here"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Voi69,"The thing with youseeBigGirl is that you need at least 1min of content to make it fit. 2Volt was a very good choice IMO. If anything, I think they messed up Eren going through the building. I wish it looked like his fight against Annie. They might redo this part slightly differently at the beginning of next episode."

I've already got one with the Interview OST and I'm hoping to send both to my anime-only friend to ask for his thoughts on it (after he's seen the actual episode, of course).

As an aside, [this](https://twitter.com/USurped_/status/1348323108235534337?s=20) is easily **the best edit I've seen.**"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daddy_Kush,Honestly how I wished erens transformation scene is that when eren has that sudden sound of shock and bolt when we was about to transform it would cut back to Willy giving his final line before all of a sudden a titan appears from the stage all captured at a low angle on the stage like in the manga where we get to see eren smash down then pick back up to get that final scene I thought the scenes were good trying to make him look like a monster but I didn‚Äôt like how they made his eyes glow like flood lights

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RomanItalianEuropean,"Did they really remove the innocent family dying because of Eren's transfornation? That just fucked up the whole scene. Eren telling Reiner ""i am like you"" points out that he is going to do what Reiner did to achieve his goal, aka killing innocents as collateral damage. In other words Eren was not saying that they were both ""good"", he was saying that they were both ""evil"". It feels like they completely missed the point."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arafatnabi,The last part couldve been better but it is still 10/10. I wanted them to show Zeke'a face when Willy talked about extinction and Eren's when he talked about being born into this world. But they just showed Erens.

still fucking insane tho"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ClickingHCT,"Idk the more i watch it the more I like the ost choice, it grows on me.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaiserigen,"Just watched, expected the worst but I LOVED IT, all the OST during Tybur's speech is awesome, with old tracks and new ones.

People also believed Helos to be Jean"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,impetu0usness,"Quick question: could Eren actually transform at the start of the episode, or was that a well done bluff? Because we know shifters can't transform if they have body parts that need healing (Eren's missing a leg).

Maybe he was hoping Reiner's mental breakdown would cloud his judgement?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GeneralVonStrohiem,"Disappointed with the ost, but I still like it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,"Haven't seen the episode, but I've been listening to Samuel Kim's version of the leaked S4 ost in preparation for a week now, imagining how the scene would go and all. That OST seemed perfect. Kinda feels like I got cucked here lol but I'll wait to actually see the episode before forming an opinion."
Everdale,Kerim44,"Same here, and I can only blame myself for hyping it up to an extreme proportions. It's just hard not to when you have such an iconic moment like declaration of war"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Saudiedaudie,"The episode was very cinematic.  
Throughout the whole episode, there was a ton of tension. The music made me anxious most of the time and it was built up in a way that makes you feel something was going to happen. I enjoyed every second of the episode and the voice-acting was just on point. I can absolutely say that I enjoyed it much more than when I first read the manga ; it was a 10/10 from me!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShingekiNoEren,"The actual scene was perfect. The OST was a complete disaster. Who thought 2Volt was a good pick for this scene? And not even the good part of 2Volt, either.

2Volt feels too triumphant. This is the part of the manga where you're supposed to start seeing that Eren isn't an absolute good, and Reiner and the Warriors aren't an absolute evil. Because Eren has begun doing what the Warriors did, massacring innocent people. I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MPYyqJJHL4) OST would have fit that narrative much better. It's dramatic, terrifying. It gives you the sense that something terrible is happening. 2Volt just has the vibes of ""HELL YEAH! GO EREN! MURDER THOSE PEOPLE!!!"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lcantchange,i am looking for the day that this sub won't complain about something and just appreciate anything about this show
lcantchange,Droyst-hoist,"Ohh it's not about the show alone. People here are complaining as well all time when a new chapter comes out. But they are just a loud minority. I bet the majority here will go ""Wow. What a great episode"" etc."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ErenYDidNothingWrong,"It felt... underwhelming. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it was a good episode, 8/10 overall. But the manga and even a FAN manga motion video had more impact for me: https://youtu.be/500N3UNA30k

Willy‚Äôs VA didn‚Äôt perform as well as he could have. They cut a small but important Zeke scene during Willy‚Äôs speech and cut a Falco line. They added a POINTLESS anime only scene which kinda ruins Eren‚Äôs whole infiltration when you think about it. 

And last but not least they absolutely BUTCHERED the music. Obviously I wanted YouSeeBIGGIRL. But even any OST from s1-s3 would have been better than their choice here. 

Besides my criticism I still enjoyed it a lot."
ErenYDidNothingWrong,CherryCokeaine,"Agree with the Zeke cut being trash. That moment was super clever in establishing Eren and Zekes differing ideologies. Expect the empty forest and full forest imagery to be cut too later on. Hard disagree with the soldiers ruining Erens infiltration tho. The Tyburs already knew ""rats"" were in the city but then we never see anything done with that information and it just feels weird. At the same time, I dont think it added much, but I understand thats probably because I already know whats going to happen lmao. For animeonlies it will probably be a huge ""oh shit"" moment."
ErenYDidNothingWrong,dhtikna,Soul madness is just on a whole other level when it came to motion manga. Only reason I have good memories of S2 OPM are his motion mangas
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Namhin_CE,"The only reason why manga watchers are frustrated and telling the ost is underwhelmed, it was 36 months back that the chapter was published and it totally changed the character of Eren Yeager. If you see back in season 2 the Reiner and Bertholdt transformation scene it was one of the best character changing moments in anime history. This Declaration of war moment had the best potential to have been the best protagonist character changing or development moment in the history of animes, but somehow do you feel it did the same? Has it been made to keep up to the potential it had? Some people liked it, some people are frustrated. But this episode had the potentiality to be liked by all, even the one who did not see AOT would have searched for these scenes over the internet. But do you feel like they will? or you will? It's the thing that made most of the people frustrated. It's not that it is bad, It's that it had the potential to be best and did not even go close to its potentiality."
Namhin_CE,liliks,wow i'm shocked you weren't disliked  by all for saying the truth . anyone says a criticism and people feel the urge to dislike . for me the most badass moment in season 4 was in season 1 when Porco appeared to save Gaby and Colt in he trenches then carried on his attacks . I truly LOVED that part .
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Soul_theorist,"Eren's expressions weren't done justice, but I guess that's to be expected. And a few scenes had the same lipflap playing over and over. But those are minor nitpicks. I loved the environment of Willy's speech. This episode was excellent. There will never be a perfect adaptation of 100, but this was really good"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,drago2000plus,"I think I prefer the ""silence"" instead of listening another time Iseebiggirl:/

The final moment is very powerful. Please guys, don' t turn this into another ""LeviVsBeast ost is bad"" kinda thing.

My only worry is the cgi, because I didn' t like it at all here. The wrist of Eren is just bad. It' s hided by smoke and all, so it' s like a very small complaint. Because the rest is just top notch animation/direction/colors."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Thoutzan,"Just watched the whole episode and I want to say :

Thank you guys for lowering my expectations !!!  I read the comments here first and thought the OST was 1/10, then I find out that it is actually 7/10 for me. It was not perfect but overall okay.

The episode as a whole I give it 9/10 !"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"I've said this before and I'll say it again; this sub has some weird proclivity of skewing really negatively at first when an episode airs. It was like this when Hero dropped and it's like this now. Like, check out the main sub's discussion thread and you'll see what I mean."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ASMR-enthusiast,"What was the purpose of Pieck hugging her Panzer squad? Why did they seem so rattled by her? Why did it say their bond was broken? I'm confused.

EDIT: I have read the manga lol, I just forgot why that scene existed or if it was in the manga."
ASMR-enthusiast,BurnBird,They got rattled because they're all simps for Pieck and the rest of the team got jealous of the guy who got hugged by Pieck. That's also the punchline of the joke that their friendship bond has been broken because they're all jealous of this one guy.
ASMR-enthusiast,kraker313,Because Panzer Squad is r/titanfolk
ASMR-enthusiast,powdergamefreak,"This is a manga spoilers subreddit, so if you havent read the manga and you want to know why she actually did it, you will have to wait for next episode. The reason they seemed rattled and that their ""bond is broken"" is assumedly because every member of the Panzer squad is very fond of Pieck, and so when she only hugged one of them, you can see every other member becomes extremely jealous."
ASMR-enthusiast,Jela331,"I think it's because she hugged only one of them, so the others got jealous"
ASMR-enthusiast,BattedDeer55,You‚Äôll see next episode
ASMR-enthusiast,solarfall79,"She's telling them to follow her because she thought the soldier (Yelena) looked suspicious. They do, and are responsible for freeing her and Porco."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raknel,"Can we agree on a compromise? :<

I also think the music at the end didn't fit, but the episode was 11/10 regardless"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"[holy shit this version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lbl0hSVzRrJ2rDs0TOjRKQunQ0wvrAWd/view) was way better, and the only thing that made a HUGE difference was the ost, it made the moment WAY more intense. if you are on computer you can compare both scenes and see how bland the original one is. I haven't noticed it that much. 

the moment is 20:33

[a shorter version](https://streamable.com/5gn3hu)"
ragnaroksoon,Nufulini,Wait is this edited or why are there 2 versions?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,br1nsk,Everyone complaining about the ost because they envisioned the one they wanted specifically and can‚Äôt get over the fact it wasnt one of the three ost they predicted.
br1nsk,neverknowsless,for real. mfs really complaining bout the ost like they didn‚Äôt condition themselves to expect something that was never confirmed in the first place. they are simply facing the consequences of their own actions üíØ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,penguins2946,"Man you know that titanfolk is being toxic when people downvote and are legitimately mad about a rick roll

Lmao people it was a great episode, wanting a different OST than what was used doesn't ruin an episode. If your biggest complaints are about now including a still with Zeke and wanting a more appropriate 10 second OST at the end of an episode, it's a great episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Marooned-Mind,"Hands down, this is the best AoT episode so far."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yolotitan,They kinda fumbled the end idk.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hazuyu_,"People complain too much, stop wanting youseebiggirl with everything. The episode was great and did not let down any expectations (for me), I'm just happy to see this animated, Mappa's nailing it, big props to them."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EldianTitanShifter,"I personally felt underwhelmed by the soundtrack and the voice acting of Willy. The Motion Manga chapters on YouTube have a better atmosphere in my honest opinion... and no, it's it's because they didn't use Youseebiggirl, that much is fine, even if it would've been cool to hear a rendition of it. 

Eren's obvious CGI Titan form was also a bit too noticeably chubby than anything we've seen before, just hope to God that the upcoming fight isn't a Pure CGI render fest."
EldianTitanShifter,Zan_tgg,"imo, I kind of expected willy to sound like that, hes supposed to sound like a noble ruler not a hype machine. to each their own I guess"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,creeper1117,Damn the ost choice for the declaration was terrible. Pretty disappointed with this episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,w00v,"Not the same hype that I was hoping it would be. But hey, MAPPA delivered and it was lit!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CrystalAbyss,"Not disappointed, next week! Let‚Äôs gooooo!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,When will people learn that motion manga is not the same as anime smh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,Ngl they did fuck up by not using better music. 2volt sounds very generic.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,"Director gets the say in deciding which soundtrack to use at what moment. Composer creates, director decide which bits get used and where."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,"Honestly, you folks need to A. Watch episodes with a more open mind and B. Rewatch the end of the episode (preferably with subs) and I‚Äôm certain most of you will warm up to it. It‚Äôs executed pretty well imo (quite similar to how I felt about Levi vs Beast Titan)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shibboleth2005,"Hrm they cut the family looking out the window as Eren transforms to kill them. https://imgur.com/a/LtNKbeA  I'm actually annoyed at this omission, I felt it was pretty important even if Mikasa is going to hammer it in next episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PrasantGrg,"Why is Eren the only character so far who has so many off model frames? That's been my major complaint for the episodes he's been in

OST choice was good tbf and they heavily dropped the blur.

Wish they held the 'I keep moving forward' frame bit longer tho.

Best adapted episode this season outside of episode 4 imo.

Edit: Really expected atleast a skipped OP/ED this episode. Oh well just give us a double length finale with no op/ed and I'll shut the fuck up for the rest of my life and die in peace"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,penguins2946,"Man, I'm not complaining but that Eren transformation scene would have been epic with the same soundtrack as the Reiner reveal soundtrack."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,Ngl the more I watch parts of the episode the more I feel like this is gonna slap with the anime-onlies. Sincerely hoping it breaks karma records because this is peak anime.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gsp9511,"I haven't watched the scene, but if the ost is 2volt I can only say the only time that ost slapped was in Season 3 Part 1 when Eren goes through his father's memories and discovers the truth about what he did and what happpened to him. 

2volt was not a good choice for Levi vs Beast Titan and I don't think it would fit the declaration of war..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DsRaAmGeOtN,The ost was good i think.[We would get something like that if they used youseebiggirl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xMAQ6IKqB4&pbjreload=101&ab_channel=AttackonTitanSohbetveƒ∞√ßerik) but i am not sure
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"I wish they showed Willy being smashed in the stage instead of that of that HUGE cgi dust cloud, but I understand why they did it...censorship and everything. my biggest hype is for the next one, this here was basically just talk, but at least we finally saw it and it was cool to see the rumbling too"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSilverSeraphim,"Finally watching the full episode myself, [and right off the bat you know that AoT actually getting a mature audience warning for the first time means shit's gonna go down lmfao](https://i.imgur.com/S4VzcEP.png)"
TheSilverSeraphim,Mike_Kyojin,Is it a sign that they're not gonna censor stuff as heavily as WIT?
TheSilverSeraphim,ragnaroksoon,"they will put a giant red WARNING full of skulls in the last arc, especially in rumbling episodes"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoFlavour,"FUCK YES.

everything was amazing. People like to bitch about nothing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kelenkel,"Damn it was glorious, VA and Animation was on point, dialogues were as good as in the manga. Music until the last scene was godly. Truly a masterpiece of episode. People should calm down, 2volt might be just fine but we shouldn't trash this greatness just because they didn't use your favorite song. 10/10 thanks Mappa!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Myoubi,I hope next episode starts with Willy & Magath scene and then Eren transformation with trailer OST.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,The symphony played right before Willy‚Äôs speech was so good. I hope they include it in the  CD.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BASKET_SPHERE,There are so many pretentious elitists in this thread holy fuck
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,llMadmanll,"The episode is amazing overall. The terror in Reiner's eyes, the emotionlessness in Eren's, Falco realising he was tricked, and the ending shot etc. Only things I wished for was the final scene having more wide shots and a better OST. [Something like this](https://youtu.be/IVgUIXwmfBQ) for instance."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ENKlDU,Again nothing like sorting by controversial to enjoy my evening üòé
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LupusFidus,I love it. Just adore it. It's comeback full circle. Eren in his way is asking for Reiners forgiveness.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,toastedkiki,I got so excited at when Eren transformed I started to fucking cry LMAO
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,smeagi,The best part of the OST debate is getting to rewatch the guy in the crowd getting nailed in the head with a rock as eren emerges
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mxiao,cheers to everyone who‚Äôs been waiting for this episode to be animated :‚Äô) just cheers it‚Äôs been so long
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thatguy11m,I thought this was how the last episode would end. I'm concerned about pacing and hopefully they surprise us with an announcement for another 2 part season.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tanthesecond,"The amount of negativity towards MAPPA as a studio for this is depressing. We get it people, you visualized an OST you liked and decided by yourself as the only fitting one for that moment, grow the fuck up. The episode itself was remarkably good and did justice to the manga, while YES, i agree that 2volt wasn't the best choice, it wasn't anywhere close to the worst either. YSBG on the other hand would have blatantly sucked for this scene, although i couldn't say the same for the declaration of war theme samuel leaked a few weeks ago.

But is this nearly enough to condemn MAPPA as a studio? nah, FUCK that. the moment was still hype as HELL, and i thoroughly enjoyed it while not thinking a second of the OST choice. This isn't even about high expectations at this point, it's visualizing false bullshit such as the studio directors having the exact same taste as you in the music, the stills and everything else that wasn't ""up to par"", or ""underwhelming"", when in reality it's still great, just not exactly as you interpreted.

Personally could be the best episode of the season for me, absolutely nailed everything other than the music for the finale, which is still a banger and doesn't take away from anything in the scene. I envy anime onlies getting to watch this for the first time"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,Wit Studio and Araki: Miss me?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justchilling320,not sure why they chose a heroic sounding ost at a point where the audience are meant to feel scared and disgusted at eren. pretty embarrassing tbh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wanderer76007,I think the sound director is obsessed with 2Volt üòÖ
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EDNivek,I can't believe people are mad over an OST... I'm a Muv Luv fan imagine only getting S4 of AoT adapted.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turth3,Feels like people at this point are just reacting to the scene they had envisioned in there heads that shit fell totally flat. Some of the motion manga versions on YouTube were better then that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lasernatoo,"I feel like the only people complaining about the OST in the final scene are the people who had a very specific vision of how they wanted the scene to be, so anime onlys won't be missing out. Personally, I hadn't listened to the new ost until after I had already seen the episode, but I do admit that it would have been a better choice. Therefore my rating of this episode goes from a 12/10 all the way down to a measly 11/10.

Edit: Also YSBG would have been too loud over the characters' lines, and requires too much buildup to start and end in an effective way for this scene."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Midnight017,"Yeah I was dissapointed... In myself. I overhyped it to impossible standard. Did not help that I watched SoulMadness clip on repeat for 2 weeks...

Thinking more about the episode and watching anime reactions made me a lot happier about the episode..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Biniti123,"Wow japanese fans are vocal about the new episode and they are not happy. Theyre discontented with the way eren's titan is animated and the whole shitty music. I guess they were holding out hope for a good ost route. There's even a petition that's garnered thousands of signatures to have the episode changed. Obviously that wont happen but it shows how unhappy they are.

Memes aside, all the doom posting I saw was almost completely unwarranted, the only slightly disappointing aspect was the music, the art/animation/pacing/acting was mostly perfect, but it could have been a true 10/10 if they had a different OST for the last 2 minutes. Coming from someone who was very critical of episode 1 and 3, I expected a lot worse"
Biniti123,wafflez543,Lmao is that first half a copypasta?
wafflez543,RagingCabbage115,Yea but edited
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,worm31094,"Basically, the people who wanted to see erens transformation as the biggest moment ever will be disappointed. For everyone else, this episode was amazing. The ost at the end wasn‚Äôt the best but it also wasn‚Äôt terrible as the cry babies are making it seem. Just a different tone than they expected. Let them cry, anime onlies are in for a treat"
worm31094,shibboleth2005,"> Basically, the people who wanted to see erens transformation as the biggest moment ever will be disappointed.

Why wouldn't it be though? Did people read the manga and come away not thinking it was one of the top 5 most hype moments in the whole story?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ARandomItalianGuy,Why yall bitching about the ost that shit was amazing...
ARandomItalianGuy,yaldafigov,"I agree, it was made as it should, with the trembling of drums and screams"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dk22101999,Why the heck are people complaining about people complaining about OST?
dk22101999,viell,every thread ends up being people complaining about those complaining about those complaining...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NIssanZaxima,"Great episode, shit OST choice but I don't feel it will be as bad for anime only's who have played a certain song in their head (like me) while re reading this manga chapter over and over and over."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Master3530,"I can't believe they didn't show Zeke when Willy was saying ""I wished for Eldians to go extinct"", ruined adaptation smh"
Master3530,ragnaroksoon,"oh shit you're right. It wasn't even necessary to put an animated scene there, just a still image was ok, like they did with the rumbling, Eren's jump and some others"
ragnaroksoon,Master3530,"Yeah, it doesn't matter that much but it wouldn't be too hard to do"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,The samurai show was unironically more intense than the climax of this episode tho LOL.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StormyIce,MAPPA GOAT MAPPA GOAT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TyrannosaurusRekt238,I always thought the speech would've been louder but he was rather softly spoken. OST could've also been better for the ending
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,"It always seemed to me that adapting 100 as an anime would be hella hard, especially with how the panels are used at the end, so they did almost as good of a job as they could do imo."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,is it just me who thinks the soundtrack used wasnt the problem but the pacing lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fukato,I think they made that part near the end silence so fans can go add the ost suit their tastes on their own lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BaziPlayz,"If not YSBG, atleast they could've used Declaration of war. 2Volt just doesn't seem to bring out this scene's potential, doesn't feel right."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arafatnabi,"The whole regeneration segment alone makes this episode a contender of best episode. Its up there in ranks of hero, if they had nailed the ending if wouldve surpassed hero."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rawrr16,"2Volt song takes some parts from "" The Weight of Lives"") (THE WEIGHT OF LIVES, Knowing what's next, this is a great track selection:

When Hange's squad fights the colossal titan (S2)

Colossal Titan Falling (S2)

Marlowe Death (S3)

Levi Vs Beast Titan (S3)

Eren memories about him eating his dad (S3)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KynoSSJR,"Waiting to watch the episode with my anime only friend, so fucking excited I can‚Äôt explain this feeling. Some of these negative comments are scarying me"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Juu1e1,Ik it was a 5 second animation but I feel like Zofia and Pieck have some sort of sister relationship
Juu1e1,H-K_47,Piek and Porco are basically the parents or older siblings of the Warrior cadets. Reiner is either their dad or depressed uncle in this scenario.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,smegma_toast,Jesus fuck Eren's look right before he transforms. 10/10 episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BombadMus1im,That was amazing. No words left for me. MAPPA is doing great and I think they‚Äôll take it home fine.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jjeg6804,"This episode sure had its goods and bads and the still in the end with Eren ripping Willy apart felt a little meh but in the end, i was satisfied. but The War Hammer Titan episode will surely be insane. As a manga reader, i have high expectations from Mappa."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fkinra,the pacing leading to erens transformation was underwhelming. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pcPXzDHRI4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pcPXzDHRI4) this fan made one had better pacing imo.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Onion-with-layers,"A shame we didn‚Äôt get the titan head flashing before Eren transformed we usually see in fan animations, I tought it was a good touch, but otherwise this episode was as amazing as the first time I read the chapter"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NIssanZaxima,"I was so hyped up about the Eren transforming I almost forgot how amazing the dialogue between him and Reiner were leading up to that. Although I was dissapointed with the OST choice during the transformation, MAPPA completely blew me away on the rest of the episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lhudooooo,why is everyone so hyped to watch attack on mid? samurai show is where it's really at. just watch this mid titan thing after i'm wiping cum out of my room from the absolute blast i have watching samurai show
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AIManiak,Man they completely messed up the transformation. Everything else was great.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BXCooper,They didnt include attack titan face flash when eren transforming.. i was hoping that tho üòê
BXCooper,Fuiger,"That wasn't even in the manga, it was a fan edit, jesus you guys had such unrealistic expectations."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_LadyForlorn,It is true that the ending felt a bit underwhelming due to choice of the ost. But it was still a solid episode nonetheless. The tension and build up was 10/10. The ost for the whole episode except the ending was 10/10. I think Yuki Kaji did an excellent job. I always imagined post time skip eren to have this kind of voice with no emotion. It also makes sense since he knows what is going to happen. He carries a burden heavier than anyone else. Kaji nailed that temperament.
_LadyForlorn,EXACTLY_RIGHT,The tension was 1000/10. Agreed.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,water_breathing,"I jusr watched the leaked fanmade OST scene and it fits perfectly with the scene

I think they will just repeat that scene with this theme next episode, because the cut is so awkward at end ( not critcising episode or anime, just the cliffhanger is awkward for anime while it works for manga) of this episode and flow of next episode wont be jarring 

So Magath & Willy carriage scene => cut to declaration of war speech with new theme => rest of episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Animegamingnerd,People here really forgot that composers are suppose to make way more then like just 3 tracks.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DisgorgeX,"Missing the chance to re-use You See Big Girl was honestly my only knock on the episode. I was jittery and building hype as it unfolded, and hooting and hollering when Eren 'sploded into his Titan form. Solid 8.5 out of 10 for me. If they had hit us with that track instead I'd give it a ten outta ten and call it a masterpiece baybee.

Can't wait for the Warhammer fight boiiiiiiii"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Viviiiieeee_96,"Damn guys, I heard that the director of Season Four got depressed because of all the negativity :((("
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Catzareawesome1,"im not gonna lie, the ost at the end sucked. Very underwhelming and disappointing. I feel empty after watching that"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Butefluko,7/10 for me. People justifying the bad sound direction must understand that it can make or break certain scenes or reveals but my gripe with the episode isn't just the music they picked. It's how... Basic and lazy it is. I've seen fan animations handle Eren's transformation way better. The manga panels handled it so well for example when Eren punched the floor you could see his hulking body in the manga while in the anime it's literally just CGI smoke...
Butefluko,MCPO_John117,Yeah this was the actual complain worthy point of the episode. They basically just used the manga key animation at the end. Hopefully to pay better attention to the next action-packed episodes.
MCPO_John117,Butefluko,I really hope so they were saving their efforts to the next episodes but for me this single episode should have been much better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arafatnabi,Mappa's ost choice sucks. Im fine with 2volt for final scene but they used that weird piano ost for Reiners breakdown the same one they used for suicide scene. If they used 2volt completely with slow part for Reiners breakdown then silence then Levi vs Beast part then it wouldve been so much better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JustAboutEnoughSpace,Manga ost was better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EXACTLY_RIGHT,"I'm glad people enjoyed the 2Volt OST at the end, I personally didn't but lets not shit on each other about  something as small as that, we all love SnK in the end, and that's why we're here, because I'm the same as you :)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gensi_Alaria,Anyone else feel like the climax of the episode was really lackluster?
Gensi_Alaria,DoItNowMikasa,"The whole festival part of episode was satisfying until they marred some of the most iconic lines with Eren and Reiner. Then the white-noise ineffective music. There may as well have been no music.

I honestly can‚Äôt get used to the dampened colors and shades. Main characters are shaded as if they belong in the background. Very flat."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Warbyme,They had to buy time with cutting out some scenes to focus on the conversation even billy's face so that we can feel the freezing choking feelings. Especially After warriors fallen one and pantzer unit.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Killmota,My bad if I missed it but will their be a season 4 part 2 or is the episode 16 the final episode?
Killmota,KillSwitch111183838,there's no way the anime will end on 16 episodes without some sort of other continuation because the manga takes twice as much as 16 episodes

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cheesyvoetjes,"I see a lot of negativity about Mappa but I don't think they're doing a bad job. I like all the episodes up untill now including this one. Sure, things can always be better but I feel it's fine for the most part.

What does worry me though is the number of episodes. I read that the Blu-rays of season 4 will be 16 episodes across 2 discs. I think 16 episodes is not nearly enough.

 There are rumors the story will be finished with movies and I'm not a fan of that idea at all. You can't just stitch 5 episodes together and say it's now a movie. It doesn't work that way. Movies have a different structure than tv shows. Manga or comic books like AOT or Walking Dead translate easier into tv series because they follow the same serialized structure. Novels translate easier into movies because they usually follow the same 3 act structure. Obviously they aren't mutually exclusive. You can turn a novel into a series or a manga into a movie. But it's way easier to take serialized manga chapters and turn them into serialized tv episodes (or chapters) than trying to fit them into a 3 act movie. You have to rework it more. 

Maybe they can pull it off but I just don't like the idea of them fucking with the story at the last stretch. But we'll see how it all pans out."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JustAnIgnoramous,Tybur didn't reveal the fact the knew Eren was there like in the manga
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nacchanhere,"The satisfaction of seeing this part animated was real. Goosebumps aside, I still ended up laughing at the irony of how Willy declared war against Eren only to get killed by the damn thing three seconds later.

I kinda wished I skipped one more week so I could've watched the coverage of the fight too right after, though lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spaghestis,Bruh some motion mangas had more animation than the ending scene of this episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ihei47,Would be a perfect 10/10 episode if they used different OST
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,harisaashraf7,It was good but nowhere near bertolt and reiners transformation level. I have to wonder where are they using their budget

dengeliii,Sotterof1995,TLJ was trash. This episode was just not excellent.
dengeliii,Knightofzero10,This also happened with the Levi vs Beast titan ost. People hated it because it wasn't just like they had imagined it. I'm sure people who haven't read the manga are going to love it.
Knightofzero10,spiderknight616,Yeah. The anime-only thread will love it I'm sure.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"let's be honest, s1 in 5 episodes had way more song than this one. I wish this season had more variety in tracks, but I can understand since because the real shit is only starting, so I'm hoping to see/hear more tracks"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,This is like Levi beast titan lol. Everyone will most love it. Few readers will complain about the ost choice.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,titanslayereren,"I will be honest this episode was a little underwhelming, eren's dialogue didn't seem on point as they used to be... I'm not saying the adaption was not manga accurate but it was lacking in speech delivery Reiner's backstory was literally more interesting than the reveal of eren's identity which was supposed to be 'epic'"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vithinred000,Donno. YouSeeBigGirl or Vogel Im Kafig were definitely better choices to play. I can see people are defending MAPPA and were okay with other ost but it was a huge disappointment for me. Can someone please edit it with YSBG or Vogel Im Kafig and post link? Thank you.
vithinred000,alucidexit,the YSBG edits prove how horrible a choice it would've been. it doesn't fit at all.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Le_Fromage1,"Ok, it's just me or the ost in the moment of the declaration felt extremely underwhelming? And I was expecting more emotion in Willy's speech"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OrangeRussianNPC,"This feels like Spongebob Sweet Victory Super Bowl LIII ""controversy"" to me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not complaining about the Declaration of War, I think that was sick. But one take that's always bothered me is the whole ""Youseebiggirl is the WARRIORS' song, so it can't play anywhere else!"" argument. Like, it literally played when Eren activated the coordinate at the climax of Season 2, so how is it the Warriors' song? To be specific, it built up to his punch with Attack on D (which in and of itself has the same melody as Youseebiggirl and Apple Seed) and then it switched to Youseebiggirl before going back to Attack on D as the Scouts ran away, so, like, it's really not the Warriors' song. Plus, the main melody of Attack on D (which, again, is the same as YSBG) has played a few other times throughout the anime as well.

If people are referring to the Vogel im Kafig part being the Warriors' song, then that's just not true either, because it's been played a million times throughout the series. Not to mention that Sawano usually names his tracks quite quirkily to allude to their meanings (Attack on D for Dina, K2 being a Japanese pun for Kenny, the Female Titan theme having the female symbol) so I don't get how ""Youseebiggirl"" could relate to Reiner and Bert at all.

So just, all in all, the whole thing about Youseebiggirl being Reiner and Bert's theme feels more like a romanticization on behalf of the fan base than a deliberate trend that the anime has set up, because it is quite literally *not* their theme. I just take this conflation as more of a testament of how iconic and well-done their reveal in Season 2 was.

And if I have to type Youseebiggirl one more time, I'm going to vomit.

End rant.

Edit: Just scrolled down and saw how doomerific and contentious this thread is. Ugh. If you disagree with me, I'm more than happy to talk it out in a not-cancerous way, for what it's worth."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSpartanLemon,"Soul Madness' edit for Chapter 100's ending was leagues better than the anime's, imho.  Not saying Ep 5 was bad by any means (in fact the visuals and voices overall were fantastic).  I just couldn't help but be a little disappointed."

Just shout out to MAPPA for this animation and Isayama for the writing. You could feel the fear and regret from Reiner and Falco juxtaposed with Eren's unmoving will. Only AOT could pull off all this dialogue building up so much tension to be released in the most deadliest handshake. Especially shout out to the orchestra because those OSTs were the perfect depiction of pacing, tone and progression. Next week is only going to get crazier üëÄ"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AcceleratorLVL5,"Interesting musical choice! I personally wouldn't have picked YSBG as many wanted, but I can't say 2Volt was on my mind, either. Kind of mixed in that regard, though I'll say the rest of the episode used the soundtrack very well.

Honestly, upon further thinking on it, I can *maybe* get why they used it. Some people said it sounded heroic but I think that might be more for the perspective of the newer audience than people who really know what Eren is up to, though I feel like that might be discounted a bit by how much people liked the Marleyan crowd. Who knows!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnitaMiniyo,I can't believe we are already here! The episode was epic!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kayounenka,"Honestly that was great

I used to watch raw but I wait for good subs because this ep is dialogue heavy, they did amazing job pacing out the dialogues, it was scary as f\*ck and the exchange between Reiner and Eren was so tense, poor Falco having a mental breakdown...

and anybody mention this yet? Love Eren's calm yet haunting voice, that was scary af on how calm he's handling his emotion over the dramatic Willy speech, Yuki Kaji did amazing job

Kinda have to agree that Eren's reveal could be more tense and ""loud"", could show more people got thrown out of the building but maybe censorship, and the OST could be better"

Then the declaration of war with Vogel Um Kafig/Youseebiggirl/Apple seed"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NIssanZaxima,Up until yesterdays episode has Eren ever actually directly killed anybody? I am sure there was some indirect collateral damage with his fight with Annie in the streets of season 1 but was Willy his first person with intent that he killed?
NIssanZaxima,rubbie,He killed Mikasa's kidnappers at the age of 9
rubbie,NIssanZaxima,Holy shit I am such an idiot lol thank you.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hiervan,I don't understand why the people was arguing against the OST election. I liked very much the episode and I felt very hyped when the Attack Titan Theme was playing in the background when Willy Tybur was doing his speech.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bobbadbilla,I‚Äôm just happy anime-onlies are loving the episode while the Manga community seems to declare a war between those who are okay with the OST and those who aren‚Äôt
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,furbyfactor,honestly i‚Äôm disappointed. the entire episode was done wonderfully but the ending the part where eren shows up in titan form the first time since the timeskip it‚Äôs supposed to be an impactful hype ass moment and i feel like they dropped the ball wit the theme they used. maybe it‚Äôs my fault for gettin my hopes up on them using that theme that leaked but i figured they‚Äôd do it justice cause so far they‚Äôve been using music to perfectly capitalize on emotional or hype moments like eren meeting his grandfather or reiner seeing eren in the basement. to use a simple drum line theme and not have a dedicated leitmotif for this moment jus really puts a bad taste in my mouth and puts doubt in my mind for the rest of the season
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,skyrockkk,downvote me or whatever but the ending seemd fanmade to me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thenoobdudishot,Episode was amazing people complaining make no sense. Reiner continues to amaze
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Umbrabro,Good episode despite the mid ost and cuts parrelles between Eren and Zeke
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,skyrockkk,"The OST Is not the problem, the real issue Is that there's no buildup of the music. It Just starts out of nowhere"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NatrenSR1,Does anyone else feel like MAPPA is a really inconsistent studio? Some of their stuff is really well directed and animated and some of it looks just straight up bad
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GaaraOmega,"Mappa‚Äôs execution for the ending transformation wasn‚Äôt the best. Literally can‚Äôt even see the hand slamming Willy either.

Also the OST should‚Äôve been [YOUSEEBIGGIRL](https://youtu.be/aXVE1Rr8XtE) or the [new one](https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/kugyrh/lack_of_ost_was_disappointing_so_i_added_the/). 

The track they used could‚Äôve been way louder, can barely even hear it."
GaaraOmega,BOSHunterCO,I think it was more for censorship reasons
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,harisaashraf7,I found it underwhelming guys the fammade animations were better
harisaashraf7,dicecop,And ppl disliked me for saying that they won't do what the fans want lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fullmetal-ghoul,"Kind of disappointing I can't lie. It was obviously a great episode because the content is just so good and it was a solid adaptation of it but I wish they went above and beyond. It could've easily been one of the best episodes in any anime but I don't think it's on that level because it felt like just another episode adaptation wise, rather than a standout in the way it deserved, like the best HxH or Gintama episodes are for example. 

Main complaint like everyone else is the declaration of war which was a little underwhelming, though that's for sure impacted by the leaked OST. In the manga it's easily the best moment in the series up until that point but I feel like quite a few moments in the anime surpass it. Eren empathising with Reiner didn't really hit as hard as the manga as well but I can't really explain why tbh. I think the contrast between the more personal conversation and Willy's theatrical speech was done better in the manga as well. 

It could just be the fact I'm a bit salty over the series in general right now because of the last few chapters which killed my excitement. It was definitely a good adaptation but I was hoping for more, definitely much preferred the manga"
fullmetal-ghoul,ragnaroksoon,"yeah, it's one of those episodes where a more creative director would have nailed it with absolute mastery. [something like this](https://media.tenor.com/images/c1005cfa6d515a3d52356bed118db5ed/tenor.gif), just as example. it deserved a special touch."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,musevit,"I love the general build-up but Tybur was really underscored his speech. Youtube version is way better imo. Eren is pretty monotone, too. I wish he had a little anger or passion in his voiceacting. I liked the ending soundtrack so no complaint there. Overall solid chapter 7/10."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kleber115,"Man erens transformation was great but it was kinda of a letdown at the same time, the ost used didn't feel impactful, in my opinion it felt ""heroic"" (not sure if theres a better word since I'm not a native speaker) considering what's happening on screen, especially compared to the edit on the front page that puts into perspective that what eren is doing is completely awful whether you think that was his only option or not"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lmaomanemjef,This episode was... acceptable.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nexuro01,"Static frames with Attack Titan looks dope af while CGI Attack TItan looks like shit. Also, witch each and each episode i'm starting to notice that new OST is just ""meh"" and kinda copy-paste from previous seasons. I mean before with each newer season we had badass remixes and new bangers. But now it's just ""meh"" for me. Was expecting to get more hyped by the declaration of the war but i ended up being like ""ok guess that's end of episode"". But OST is very personal thing so idk about others opinion."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EXACTLY_RIGHT,"I swear the animation department has a boner for the transformation OST, it was played with Levi cut open Zeke and I didn't like it there either"
EXACTLY_RIGHT,Sirrama1,thats where it was from. it was on the tip of my tongue. 2VOLT AHHH out of everything.
Sirrama1,Sirrama1,"alot of the choice for music was really good for the episode though, I love how they used XL-TT with paradis imagery, it really gives you those season 1 flashbacks"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yolotitan,Seriously that ost?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Demetriade,"Someone make a cut using Youseebiggirl, PLZ"
Demetriade,yaldafigov,"YSBG is action-packed to be inserted before a battle, what kind of battle are you waiting for between a titan and a civilian trapped in a war zone
I have no idea how the lines ""We show our will to go further"" and so on can fit with this scene"
yaldafigov,Demetriade,"No no, you don't get me. The atmosphere before the beat drop in YSBG is quite phenomenonel. It fits this perfectly."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,moatasem749,"I felt more hype in the manga idk why, the voice acting was like they haven't slept for 2 weeks, I guess my problem is with the sounds it didn't give me the chills like the fan made either from the osts or the VA"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daze1717,tbh i'm not fan of mappa's coloring
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,okay-okay-okay_19,"Honestly, it was an ok episode(7/10), I was seriously giggling when I saw Reiner's face at the beginning but some moments in regard to the animation (the Rumbling scene :/) where just not it.

Also I'm tired of some people on this sub. Why can't we be disappointed sometimes? I didn't particularly like the OST for the end of the episode and people complaints are valid. It's like we're always supposed to be super positive about everything about the show! + not everyone was expecting YOUSEEBIGGIRL, and shitting on it now doesn't make you special. It would have been nice to have a memorable OST for such an important moment!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SaboTheRevolutionary,I still hate this washed out transformation lightning. I miss the golden-orangish lightning from Wit. I also felt like Willy's speech was too low energy. Listen to his speech and then listen to electricmercury's dub of the manga for this scene.
SaboTheRevolutionary,Everdale,"Yeah, I really miss the old lightning effects. It's a small thing but that split second titan face of Reiner and Bert in S2E06 was so cool. They should have done that for Eren here."
SaboTheRevolutionary,BadR0bot,"Wit Lightning >Mappa lightning

Mappa CGI> Wit CGI

All is balanced in the universe"
SaboTheRevolutionary,Adeukrox,"THIS, it fells so calm, like he was doing a ted talk"
SaboTheRevolutionary,cooldudeachyut,He started out low energy but the VA definitely delivered on those last few lines.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dicecop,"I know I should have kept my expectations low but man, they really didn't do the ending justice at all. Not to mention that they are aparently going for a monotone, dead inside Eren. They didn't even attempt to convey his emotions other than the single smile towards the end. Meh. Mappa not so goat this week"
dicecop,MindWeb125,"I've always read that scene with a monotone Eren voice tbh, it fits more than him being emotional about it. The only emotion I'm sad was excluded was his little reaction to ""I was born into this world""."
MindWeb125,Vihurah,No it was in there. He glances up and his eye pulses a bit when its said
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spirit_mert,"What a colossal wasted opportunity, not using trailer ost and instead of an overused old one.. I also wanted to see Eren's titan face flashing in the light just like it did in S2.

Edit: The best version [with actually fitting OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx5olrmRTMA&t=3s)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlackLion2000,"Overall, the episode was great but the climax was lacking a powerful ost. They redid the same mistake, the same weak ost they used in levi vs beast titan..."
BlackLion2000,tiour,Nah i think it did levi vs beast justice. Definitely not in this scene imo.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SnooHesitations1719,In my humble opinion it was a bit rushed. I wish instead of the Galliard and Peik scenes we‚Äôd have gotten the Magath and Will conversation. Also the animation was really stiff
SnooHesitations1719,Anniemal_Nitrate,Pretty sure that next episode will open up with Magath/Willy conversation that transitions straight into Eren eating Willy
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Boondrewd,"Honestly, I got more chills from the fananimation (talking about Eren transforming) than the Mappa version."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Oposo,"The fixed version of the scene: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcPk3xB1VsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcPk3xB1VsE)

Honestly, I don't think 2Volt matches the tone of the scene AT ALL. In this scene, we are supposed to emphasize with the marleyans as they are seeing this ''monster'' before them. This is our first time seeing Eren killing innocents and they use a heroic ost??? We know Eren is conflicted about his actions so the ost doesn't match his feelings and neither the tone. The only way I see it working is if it was put to contrast the horrific things we are seeing but that's kinda weak and I don't think many watchers will get it.

That said, the rest of the episode was really good!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Saikenmx,"I am going to be honest, I absolutely hate 2Volt, there were so many better options, and no, im not talking about YOUSEEBIGGIRL.

The episode was good but The end was just plain bad with that OST seriously.

This soundtrack is the black sheep of SnK, the first part of it at least would've been better.

Keep downvoting me, it's not like I care."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JudgeMate,"Shaming people for their criticism is so Reddit it ain't even funny; Just because some people had higher expectations (not just for the ost) doesn't call for others to starts babbling ""Hey man, I enjoyed it I don't know why you wouldn't just start consuming stop asking questions :)"".. MAPPA didn't mess it all up, but keep in mind that the source material is so good that even fan-made videos also looked great on some level to what a million-dollar animation company can produce can put it in perspective. We are still 11 episodes away from the season and I can bet the budget will only get tighter going forward.

Like, you do realize  Kodansha could've waited for WIT to finish whatever the hell they are working on and then give them AoT, right? They didn't because they wanted to cash out on the high hypes that the manga is finishing regardless if the quality suffers. And I say this as the guy who doesn't mind paying a premium for the Bluray sets, I don't see why I would for this season when the manga art is so superior.

Kinobros, we lost this battle....but then again that's what makes us kinobros I guess."
JudgeMate,bubuplush,"I don't really think the fan videos looked ""great"", most of them only traced the manga and moved the characters with spriter or other cheap and quick methods which looked very messy and weird. But I really appreciate the dedication and love people have for the fan animations :D

&#x200B;

But saying it's on the level of Mappa or comparable is a bit weird, the only thing people could argue about when they compare them would be their favorite ePiC soundtrack we clear didn't hear 1000 times already"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Voi69,Serious: What is the samurai show about? Is it pure fiction or based on historical events/people?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Naskr,Fucking nailed it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jermz334,"They added a scene where soldiers were charging the basement,clearly shows that Magath and Willy knows what's about to happen. So that's why they're talking about that building on the last episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raito21,"I wanted to see the scene with my GF in crunchy but I had to give up to the shitstorm in this shit. It was 10/10, I fucking wish I shared the moment with her, I'm never reading live threads again smh"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,THE_DOCTOR4," Episode was awesome, ost at the best scene was not that great"
THE_DOCTOR4,Sixstryder,"Bruh, youseebiggirl or that leaked version of season 4‚Äôs theme would have been fucking perfect."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tohsakarin12,"So apparently, they have decided to rearrange Willy-Magath conversation."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Background-Web-7609,Where‚Äôs everyone watching it? I‚Äôve got crunchyroll and it‚Äôs nowhere to be seen
Background-Web-7609,Lewis_Parker,Everyone watched the raw unsubbed version bro. Crunchy should have it in 3 hours and 45 minutes since this comment
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mariobeltran1712,"EPICNESS, OMG, that was so satisfying to watch"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,killinrin,"If we‚Äôre bitching about small things in this episode, honestly, the only problem I still have is Pieck‚Äôs VA! I imagined her voice sultry and deeper. But that‚Äôs not episode specific. Pieck‚Äôs voice reminds me of Sakura from CCS for some reason when I wanted like a cool woman‚Äôs voice. :/

But that‚Äôs just me, this episode stands alone with the greats like ‚ÄúHero‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerfect Game‚Äù imo"
killinrin,purpleglass26,I thought the same. I imagined her voice deeper and more focused. Oh well
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamnotapancakee,"This episode was soo exciting! Seeing Udo in the end credits kinda hurt me, I feel like him and Zofia‚Äôs deaths will leave more of an impact in the next episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NATORDEN,"At around 21:46 you see a man in the background being hit by a rock and dying. 
My god AoT has one of the best animation out of the anime I like, puts One Piece to shame"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WhipsandPetals,Yet another episode to destroy other ongoing series.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gold-bandit,They used the same ost for that was in levi vs zeke. And it didn't fit both times lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MDuff57,"Pretty gutted that they slow-mo‚Äôd, still-framed and CGI‚Äôd perhaps the single most important/impactful moment in the manga. The episode was great up until the actual declaration. The final scene (to me) felt like a period at the end of what should have been an exclamatory sentence. In my opinion the music should have been louder, the animation should have been 2D and fluid, they shouldn‚Äôt have slow-mo‚Äôd the transformation, and they should have showed the actual destruction of the stage instead of concealing it behind smoke. Slow-mo and still-frames just sapped all the energy out of the scene for me. 

Aside:
If you loved it then I‚Äôm genuinely excited for you (and a little envious)! I would love to hear why you thought it was great. I also want to see if anyone feels similarly to me?"
MDuff57,DarthDookieMan,"I don‚Äôt completely agree, but I think, to add to the slow mo, is maybe show the Attack Titan fully forming right at the closeup of him and Willy as a call back for the first season where he blocked the cannon fire. 

I found this shit hype regardless."
MDuff57,Everdale,"I'm just hoping the energy they saved on this scene is showcased in the upcoming action heavy episodes. If those fail to deliver, then it'll be rather disappointing."
MDuff57,ragnaroksoon,"yes, this scene definitely deserve a better track and a fluid animation. at this point I'm really afraid that the whole season will be like this."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,angelrcd,"The last part was very underwhelming, this can't hold a candle to the BR reveal, very questionable choice of OST, they butchered the part when Willy says he was born into this world and when he calls upon the extermination of Paradis and Eren smiles sadly.

On the other hand the Willy's play was very well done.

6/10, dissapointing"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gasfar,Titanfolk users on their way to downvote every single comment saying the episode wasn't a perfect masterpiece
Gasfar,namatt,"The vast majority of titanfolk does the opposite, actually."
namatt,Gasfar,"I guess it's just up to the biases and perception everyone has, but to me this sub has been a ""MAPPA good WIT"" bad circlejerk this past few 7 months"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Crisisofland,"I'm shaking holy shit that was insane. And Reiner's VA breakdown, i almost broke with the him gdi

MAPPA GOAT"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,Hot take: Attack Titan screaming with no music over it > Using a bombastic track. It‚Äôs interesting how thinking about sound effects and voice over changes your perception.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kerenjeager,"The episode was really good, but there is a lack of something. IMO there was a lack of intensity for example in Tyber‚Äôs speech (even if it was really good). Even the OST... So I give 8/10"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kobriks,Could be 10/10 but 2Volt for the final scene makes it 8/10. I am very sad now.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,I'm listening to that trailer edit song non-stop because it is catchy and powerfull as fuck unlike the one we got in the war declaration scene. 2volt isn't bad but it's doesn't fit at that moment AT ALL. it's pretty forgettable.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,Lol Mappa is going to be lynched for not using Youseebiggirl
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dracoscale,"I was fucking shivering the whole episodes, MAPPA NAILED IT.  


Many stills tho, looks like they're going all out next ep"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Boondrewd,It's time like this that I miss WIT. The ending OST really killed my hype. But the episode was really good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,toko75,"Man i really expect they gonna use the new leak ost for declaration of war.

This is remind me the OST for Levi vs Zeke, it's good but could be better.

Mappa miss the chance to break the internet today"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,evermuzik,I can only nut so much.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rayodoble,I'm sad
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,God I hope nobody attacks the already overworked team at MAPPA at any point during this season. Internet behaviour doesn‚Äôt make me very hopeful tho.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chef--Boyardeee,The lack of facial animation for Ogweno and Nambia when they're clapping though at the end lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mindless_Present,Is it just me or did they leave Zeke out of the part where they showed Zeke and Eren in Manga when Willy talked about hating his blood but wanting to live because of him being born into this world?
Mindless_Present,Sachielkun,Yep and that was kind of important foreshadowing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Siomai_God,"Idk who had the bigger shit in their pants, Falco or Reiner?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RomanItalianEuropean,"At first watch i didn't like it. They removed a very important scene. Bad OST choices. Also, not much movement going on. Gotta be honest, the Manga and even fanimations left me a better taste in my mouth. 

I'll rewatch it later."
RomanItalianEuropean,Voi69,"> Also, not much movement going on

This is the only bad thing that I noticed. A lot of the time it felt like watching a motion manga."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JustAboutEnoughSpace,"Forget the ost, you can't tell me [this is](https://imgur.com/a/8iyh9fp) honestly a good adaptation of the manga panels. Why do the always add so much smoke and light and shit to the point that you can barely make out whats happening. I know it's low quality images but there's almost no detail in any of the frames. The last scene you can't see anything underneath Eren because there's just flashing lights and smoke everywhere. The bad ost is just the cherry on the cake."
JustAboutEnoughSpace,justchilling320,i think we‚Äôre just at the point where the anime can‚Äôt keep up with the detail of the manga
JustAboutEnoughSpace,Raviolla,"kinda disagree

im not gonna argue too much regarding the art since those are just low res photos. the direction and animation for the scene was fucking sick tho

personally i dont watch anime and expect scenes to be drawn as beautifully as manga. i watch anime to see manga brought to life with movement, and i think MAPPA did a fantastic job there"
JustAboutEnoughSpace,Karpthegarp,"Eh, let's wait for the HD version to see more accurately."
JustAboutEnoughSpace,niwtzz,"Be careful, they will call you toxic for making just a few criticisms, you cannot criticize, you just have to consume."
niwtzz,JustAboutEnoughSpace,State of this place sometimes.
JustAboutEnoughSpace,jung2019,I know right?  It was really shocking. Seems like studio deen has lent some animators to Mappa as most of their good ones are busy animating JJK.
JustAboutEnoughSpace,q_uo,"Yeah, what's with the dust obscuring literally everything? The [second best panel of the chapter](https://imgur.com/a/mSXmRb3) is [cut in half and obscured by dust.](https://imgur.com/a/Xh5SzjO)"
JustAboutEnoughSpace,FakedThunder,"Man you really are nitpicking here, gimme a break bih"
FakedThunder,JustAboutEnoughSpace,So criticising anything is nitpicking?

Gasfar,Drag0nKiller900,They didn't hand drawn it* CGI is still animation
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,forbizzen,"The ending ruined it for me, its certainly a good episode but man what was that ost choice what in the actual fuck"
forbizzen,iurm,what ost played?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Omoshiroineko,Damn they messed up the OST at the end. I hope someone will make an edit with some better fitting music.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raiku06,"The lack of a good soundtrack for this episode really hurt me and I say that because i really love this episode an aot in general and throughout the first 3 seasons i fell the music was spot on .

Edit: After rewatching the episode I have to say that i  was wrong , the soundtrack was good , but i still think the final scene could have been scored better . That of course not ruining this episode for me in the slightest , I love this episode and I think it will go down as one of the better episodes in all of anime."
Raiku06,simonsays44,"hot take, the music throughout the episode was super good. OG attack on titan during the performance was god tier"
Raiku06,walker_paranor,What are you talking about? The soundtrack was incredible.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MyDogIsAMaggot,"since 2volt was used, what bit of it did they use? From the sounds of it, it's definitely not the same bit that was used when Eren recovered his memories of him eating Grisha"
MyDogIsAMaggot,BloxyKev, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyQOYbXsOlg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyQOYbXsOlg)
BloxyKev,MyDogIsAMaggot,Huh. People make it seem like it was a downright horrendous choice. I was expecting worse thanks to the dramatics lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,Eren's pickle eyes are back from the preview.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Maenros,... well... that was unexpected
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deanNoFap,Last time subs came in early. Will it happen this time?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Real_Live_Sloth,Poor rando lady in blue. I rev to be like who tf is that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarthDookieMan,OH MY GAWWWD
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,melon_milkshake,Who's the dude who led pieck and what's his face into the hole?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LtGeneral-Obasanjo,How‚Äôre they gonna wrap this up in 16 episodes?
LtGeneral-Obasanjo,jwaters0122,probably the 1st cour is 16 eps & 2nd cour is less. not confirmed tho
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,animelover693,"I wonder if they're ever gonna use 1st0Sk again, such a good track"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,"i was right, i just needed a rewatch lol

this episode was fucking PHENOMENAL. i take back all my criticisms about the declaration of war. my only complaint now is i wish willy's declaration sounded more intense? aside from that mappa did an incredible job

one of my complaints upon the first watch was that eren's transformation felt less explosive and surprising. rewatching now with subs however i did feel like eren's transformation just came out of fucking nowhere. from him shaking reiner's hand to YEAGERBOMB. his delivery of his lines were so lowkey and silent that a transformation is the last you'd expect. we praise reiner's VA but i think eren did a fantastic job too

im sorry for my initial disappointment mappa this shit was nuts and i just had to rewatch"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,frosted_drip,Am I the only one that thought the ending of this episode would have more sound effects or louder audio to hype up the climax of the episode. I was honestly just expecting key soundtrack or ost for such an important turning point in the series.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,boojiboo,Are we getting the scouts next episode or is that episode 7?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,metrize,What chapter is this? I want to start reading the manga
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,crunkButterscotch2,"I think i was great!  But could‚Äôve flashed out Eren titan form attack more, but everything else is beautiful!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mama_lu0831,"Wild to me that anyone is complaining about the animation or anything, like I‚Äôve waited THREE YEARS to see this stuff animated, they could‚Äôve drawn it with crayons and I would‚Äôve been happy (not really but you get the point)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kai_Uchiha99,"Im disappointed tbh, the entire reason i was even watching the anime was for this exact moment cause i was hype to see the music playing and how hype it was, but it ended up somehow less hype than the manga"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DimashiroYuuki,Damn that was super underwhelming. And I waited 2 weeks for this???
DimashiroYuuki,motivator2668,"that ost man.

the ost could have have made the difference"
DimashiroYuuki,Bypes,Uhh what did you want instead?
Bypes,DimashiroYuuki,"* Better OST
* Only animate 99 and 100 for next episode
* Pacing was horrible
* How did the soldiers know where Eren is?? Dafuq that wasn't in the manga
* COMPLETELY fucked up Erens facial expressions. 
* Seems like they cut some lines from Eren, but I'm not 100% sure, my japanese isn't that good yet.
* Transformation scene was terrible
* Cut out Zeke for Idk what reasons. Will bite them in the ass later
* Willy's VA was a joke. Electricmercury on Youtube did a way better job.
* Reiners mental breakdown could have been better"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Patrick4356,The finale scene was a bit of a letdown for me personally the ost wasnt there. And that final shot of Eren's titan didn't look very good. His titan roar was really underwhelming. Soulmadness made this feel so epic in his version. I guess they're saving the budget
Patrick4356,Shootrax,I actually liked the roar and the final shot. I think the rose could've been a bit louder but that's fine.
Patrick4356,SupremeM60_,"If seven deadly sins taught me anything, it was that animation studios don't ""save budget."" It generally gets worse and worse. Not saying that Attack on Titan's the same, but..."
SupremeM60_,TrungTH,The preview for the next episode looks like the titan battle will be handrawn. The warhammer titan transformation looks sick af.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,Wish we still had Araki directing this. Seems like most of the epic scenes are going to fall flat because of odd  soundtracks.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bitcheslovedroids,I guess I cant enjoy the anime anymore since they didnt use the best song for a scene
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,harisaashraf7,"Why is there so much hate for ppl who wanted better ost played at that scene. No one  is saying it should have been youseeBIGGIRL, anything epic or sad would have worked."
harisaashraf7,Kaiserigen,I watched after reading comments and was scared. The ost was beautiful and worked great
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vista1337,"Direction was meh. How can you not use a song drop for when Eren transforms? Out of all the songs you could use you used that one? Plus they didn't animate the panel where Eren in his titan and Willy both have their arms open... I'm really dissapointed.

[How can a dude on youtube direct this scene better than the studio?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de4AmeYwfFs)"
Vista1337,intoTheStarrryNight,"Lmao!!! That video deserve more... 


Honestly that scene was perfect to use any OST with vocals instead of music."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Saikenmx,Lmfao they messed up the end with the OST
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,harisaashraf7,"Underwhelmed is all I'm feeling since this season started, perhaps reading the manga plus having weird expectations ruined the experience for me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jwkwon306,"I forgot to say this last episode.

The direction was so bad for the conversation at the balcony between Magath and Willy. 180 degree line was broken so many times with no reason, making the cuts feel jarring and unnatural. Also the framing of the two characters for the wide shot was pretty ugly.

I see people here are complaining about how bad the ‚Äúdirecting‚Äù was without really understanding what it means. I personally didn‚Äôt see any scene with particularly bad directing in this episode."
jwkwon306,rubbie,"The two instances that really stuck out to me this episode were when the crowd finds out that Karl Fritz orchestrated everything (there were too many cuts alternating between the crowd and the stage where nothing is happening), and the massive Rumbling shot (similarly, there were too many shots alternating between the Colossal Titans and the crowd's faces)

Both moments kinda took me out of the episode a bit, but they were pretty minor tbh"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,okbuddybutbruh,Yeah reddit isn't the only place where people are disappointed. Twitter is also dissatisfied with the ost. So it wasn't just a reddit thing afterall
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Music choice extremely disappointing. Episode wasn‚Äôt as good as it was supposed to be.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,erenismydaddy,Where was the music... where was the flavor
erenismydaddy,OranNee,You had it on mute
erenismydaddy,DoItNowMikasa,Cereal with no milk.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bod3flick3r,Soulmadness and kuskruger did it better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jud3P,That was underwhelming...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,criestotheclicking,"Obviously it‚Äôs better to wait for the subs, but first impression is that the issue was pacing? The tension wasn‚Äôt really there for me. Also lol @ that frame of Gabi Zofia and Udo that they reused three times"
criestotheclicking,Final-Solid,The tension was there imo. There was a solid few seconds of pausing before Eren and Reiner talked.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Capt_Monty,"I just wanna put in perspective the comparison between the bertholdt and reiner reveal and declaration of war, becuz i think one of them elevated the scene in the anime while the other was only an acceptable adaptation.  I‚Äôm no mappa hater i love their work on season 4 so far but I feel like there‚Äôs a lot they could‚Äôve done to make declaration of war feel like that wow moment. It‚Äôs fine as it is, but feels hollow at the same time and I wish they would‚Äôve kept in some details such as the people above eren in the apartment building when he transforms or the punch through the stage.  Those are kinda nitpicks ik but the ost is an issue too that‚Äôs been talked abt so much already that I don‚Äôt need to say much abt it here, and the attack titan looked a bit whack and fat imo. As far as an adaptation of a big moment goes declaration just feels bare bones. On the other hand, the warriors reveal took a big moment and used a new ost, good pacing, and added bits like the flagpole snapping to make the scene that much more tense.  It took what was great in the manga and made it even better.  I wish mappa could‚Äôve done the same for declaration, but as it is rn it‚Äôs not bad, it just could‚Äôve been better. I‚Äôm very much looking forward to what mappa does w the next few episodes tho the shots we saw of eren and the warhammer in the preview look great."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IcarusIvys,"I am about to type something very long, its more like a vent than **complaint,** I just think it needed to be said.

I, as a manga reader who has loved SnK for the longest time, read the manga and watched the series several times, I think I had set way too high expectations of this scene, than what was projected. I think there could have been some details which could have made the last scene way better than it actually was.   
The episode through the entirety of it until the last scene was 10/10 for me, I loved the use of the good old OST from the previous seasons. I had tried to defend it from all sorts of false criticism (so please don't assume me to be one of those haters who falsely complain), but this time I have some things to say as well.  
I am happy seeing the anime-onlies be happy, but what they have in consideration while watching this episode is the progression of the story line as well execution, but we manga readers already know what is about to happen so we focus more on the execution of the scene.   
Even some of the YT motion mangas had depicted this chapter in a better way (in the OST department especially).  
Here are some of things I personally think could have been done well.  


* For the people who are saying that YSBG wouldn't be a good match for this scene, yes I do agree with the fact that the symbolism of YSBG is a bit different from what was trying to be symbolized in this scene but you can't possibly tell me that 2VOLT, an OST which literally generates vibes of heroism is more suitable than YSBG? I just feel like we got played because of how we got hinted YSBG towards the end of ep4, but we got this. Yes I am aware of the fact that we can still get a redone scene from the recap of this episode in the next episode, with a better OST, **but the impact can never be the same as how it could have been in this scene.** I'd have rather wanted the leaked OST which actually fit really well with this scene, or just anything new if YSBG didn't ""fit well"". I am saying this after watching lots of edits with different OSTs playing, and they do sound and fit in better. Yeah i understand the fact that the playing of YSBG or any other hype OST would giveaway what was about to happen, but I don't agree with that, if adjusted well, it could have still fit in with the surprise element punching in.  

* I really wish Willy's voice was more echoed and loud in the climax of the episode, to build the intensity and commotion. I wanted him to scream, with fear in his eyes. I did love the fact that his nervousness was reflecting in his voice, I just think it could have been louder, echoed and more focused.   

* We could have had details like, the Marleyan soldiers rushing down to the basement, I wish they were banging the door, during the climax of the scene before Eren transformed and they were storming in, it would be amazing to make it more intense.  

* I wanted Eren's titan to have more sharp features, the face looks really good, it looks more terrifying compared to that of WIT's design but I really wanted his eyes to look at Willy's, smashing his hands down the stage, and then lifting him up in the air. In this episode it looked really simple, it looked as though he just grabbed him and lifted him in the air, and the CG made Eren's titan at 21:57 look like a fat Roblox character, and I'm generally not even picky with animation.   

* I also wanted those manga textures that Reiner and Bertholdt had in their reveal, I wanted Eren to have it as well (would look sick and I know for a fact that MAPPA would have no problem doing it.)  

* In a nutshell, i just wanted more focus in the last part of the episode, in both animation and music department, slight elongation of it as well but i guess we didn't have time did we?  
Well it could still be adjusted by cutting some scenes and adding them later but oh well.  
Still loved the episode, 10/10, its just that it could have been 10000/10. But we move, **it is what it is.**"
IcarusIvys,batben00,"Agree with all of it except wanting the soldiers to bang on the door to create suspense. I agree it would make things more tense but I think that would give anime only a the impression that eren had to transform because of the soldiers and not because of his own motives. You‚Äôre spot on about the rest of the complaints though and you put it perfectly, a 10/10 episode that could have been a 10000/10"
batben00,IcarusIvys,"Yeah you are completely right about that, and thank you."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ArsenalNoob,"The final scene where Eren appears out of the theatre was so underwhelming. It was just... bad. To put it simply.  The music choice wasn't what I'd go for, I'd rather YouseeBIGGIRL. And I feel like it was extremely awkward, for example that roar like sis what was that, a pig could do better! All jokes aside, I didn't like the episode that much, considering the long wait I felt it was a bit disappointing. The talk with Reiner wasn't that bad though I guess. 7/10 overrall."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cybersidpunk,"man im kind of disappointed, i expected the music in this episode to be next level and also CG eren ruined it. i really dont have much expectation for the future episodes anymore. if they are using cg for when there are only 2-3 titans i cant imagine how bad the current chapters are gonna look...

edit : https://twitter.com/TheGamingClaw/status/1348312497779048450?s=19 this sounds way better!"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Manatee_Ape,"So, what Eren is getting at about being the same as Reiner, is that he‚Äôs going to go destroy his enemies likewise?

He doesn‚Äôt take that realization and try to make peace?"
Manatee_Ape,gaveler-unban,"You‚Äôll see exactly why he didn‚Äôt try to do that this time at a later date. And my wording is correct, this time."
Manatee_Ape,SupremeM60_,"The longer the season goes, the more you'll see that neither sides are good or bad. They both do messed up stuff because it's what they believe they have to do to survive. 

And watching seasons 1-3 you can tell that Eren is fueled by hatred. He's not some noble anime protagonist. The thing that keeps him going is his hatred for titans, his hatred for Reiner and Berthold, and his hatred for Marley."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gamesus10,"Not a fan of the ending scene, but otherwise perfect"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shoaib_32123,What i didn't like most about this episode is how they weren't able to capture the tension between Eren and Reiner. When i first read the manga it was hype. Reiner seemed to actually afraid on Eren. It just wasn't enough man.
shoaib_32123,Gwynbbleid,"I felt completely the opposite that's the best thing they did. Although there were some details like ""To do the same as you"" that it hurted"
shoaib_32123,jwaters0122,"lol wut. it was some of the most tense moments in anime. Reiner's VA, him breaking down and Eren sharing his perspective and transforming was some of the best scenes 

what more could you ask for."
jwaters0122,shoaib_32123,I just had higher expectations. Am i the only one who feels this way?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,erehbigpp,"I think next episode will make or break it for MAPPA. They haven‚Äôt shown us any action - everything looks like when in previous season wit did this for Rod Reiss transformation in the cave and all we got was a still shot from the manga. It worked that one time and kinda worked today but not really. I understand their desire to stay close to manga but they could‚Äôve been more creative or something

All in all I‚Äôm conflicted af"
erehbigpp,NIssanZaxima,Wait what did you skip the first episode? Lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jermz334,I'm pretty disappointed to the music tho... It's lacking something and I also thought they would use that new leaked ost

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jebezeuz,It's not literally Soulmadness so I kinda disappointed TBH.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pineapplesapples,"To me, the only drawback was the choice of OST. I hope someone edits the transformation scene to add youseebiggirl"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CubicCrustacean,Well... at least they didn't censor Willy's mangled body
CubicCrustacean,LifeButBetter,"Yeah, and the second half season 4 won‚Äôt even air on Japanese live tv which means the second half will be uncensored and very close to the anime"
CubicCrustacean,ThePreciseClimber,Japanese TV censorship is very fickle. I guess showing Willy's corpse was okay because we technically didn't see the process of... mangling. :P
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thegaslightwriter,"First impressions everything was great, it was almost perfect but imo we have been spoiled by the OST's from fandubs using YouseebigGirl and to be honest it would have been perfect for me if they had used it. 

The animation was a 10, the voice acting and the pacing were a 10. The OST was a bit lacking in the end and i dont understand why they didn't choose a better track but it really didnt take anything away from Eren's transformation for me. Animation wise it was executed perfectly. I was holding my breath until the very last moment.

The moment reiner turns to falco with glowing Eren was perfect. They chose silence for the ""i keep moving forward until my enemies are destroyed"" which is fine but they could have used the chorus from a more iconic song or even the unreleased track we heard. 

Either way i suspect they did this to cater to the anime onlies which was bound to happen.

But what ever. I loved the episode, looking forward to ""it's time Mikasa""

willy and magath's talks have probably been moved to the next episode but i have no problem with that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Akash7713,eren titan animation looked weird

CarmineX,H-K_47,It's always released at this time of the week (except last week cuz no episode cuz New Year's).
H-K_47,CarmineX,Ok thanks
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,simonsays44,did they have to censor eren punching willy? it was lowkey disappointing to only see smoke...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Efrafa11,I didn‚Äôt overhype myself and the transformation was bit a let down IMO. The rest the episode was great but It just hit harder in the manga. I don‚Äôt get the choice of making the whole transformation an orange obscured smoke show.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,okonkwo__,"So if Willy now wants to go to war with Eldia since the founding titan was stolen, why did he allow titans to be taken to Paradise in the first place? Like if Eren's dad was never sent to Paradis this whole shit would not have happened."
okonkwo__,Everdale,They sent mindless titans to the island to prevent the Paradisans from exploring outwards too easily. They didn't imagine someone from inside the government (Owl) had the Attack Titan and would send his own follower into the walls to retrieve the Founder.
okonkwo__,Demon_Samurai,Grisha was sent there by Eren Kruger through eren jaeger
okonkwo__,Professor_Oswin,Because the founding Titan was stolen after Bertolt destroyed the wall. The night when everyone in the wall started migrating to the second wall was the night Grisha finally decided to face the royal family.
Professor_Oswin,okonkwo__,but im saying that the founding titan would not have been stolen at all if Eren's dad wasnt sent to Paradise. Why didnt Willy stop that from happening and maintaining the status quo of Paradise.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,caleb2269,Reiner's facial expressions were great that whole episode.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arwilson521,I'm so glad I read the manga cause the suspense would probably have killed me by now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tagliarini295,I really hope the titans are hand drawn next episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NIssanZaxima,"Man... I just re read chapters 101-122 because it has been awhile since I have gone through it. The final 11 episodes are going to be so fucking epic this season will really be GOAT status at the current pace MAPPA is going. 

I wish the ""War for Paradis"" Arc was actually split into two more arc. RtS2 and The Rumbling arc. Sorry random spitballing but chapters 107-122 feel so much different than 123-end."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,br1nsk,This was better than the manga.

bonzy-buddy,okbuddybutbruh,Nah it isn't a dumbster fire. The last 20s felt out of touch or else the ep is solid af
bonzy-buddy,TehNeedler,"Most of the episode was pretty good to great buildup-wise, but they may have tripped on Eren's transformation right in the end (OST choice and ""safe"" 1:1 adaptation of the manga pages)"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SYK12122,"Eh...I like the episode, but Eren/Reiner felt a little quick in my opinion and the OST for the transformation it‚Äôs ok. 

I‚Äôm just a little confused on why they made this the final season instead of just season 4 focusing on the Marley Arc, wouldn‚Äôt that made it more easier for them?

But holy moly, I love the OST playing during Willy Speech and tension building up in this episode."
SYK12122,Willythechilly,It says final season but it obviously wont end it. Part 2 etc
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cooldudeachyut,"For a few seconds I saw CG Attack Titan and I did not like it all. Other than that pretty cool declaration of war scene, though I saw a video which ""fixed"" it by using the season's main theme and I think that felt way better. I wonder why the production didn't go with that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Leeemon,"Again with OST complaining, huh. Never change, I guess.

I'm glad all this bullshit will pass just like it did with Levi vs. Beast Titan and it will just be remembered as the great scenes they both are. You people create your damn headcanons and get angry when it doesn't happen lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nobuthegreat1,"Goddamn this subreddit can toxic sometimes, like when I finished the episode I was like HOLY SHIT THIS EPISODE WAS REALY GOOD, and immediately came to this subreddit expecting the majority will say the same and show their appreciation to this episode but NO NO NO instead we got neckbeards who are complaining about literally almost nothing too major, ""oH NO tHe OST WaS BaD 1/10"" it's like nothing will satisfy them.this episode is easily the best episode so far, the way the studio build up the events leading to the final scene was realy great, building up tension in this episode was soo great and had me on the edge, the music choice was good, the voice actress did an amazing job and the transformation was realy well done, this episode was dialogue heavy and this shit I mentioned was important for this kind of episodes and they nailed it, so stop complaining or just stick to the manga and don't watch, jesus looks like I will stay out of this place till the anime is over."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,conk3er,"Amazing episode, but 2volt ruined another scene"
conk3er,Runningman0301,Sound director probably fucks to 2volt in the background with the way he unnecessarily adds it to iconic scenes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Stjckman,"SOME of y‚Äôall manga readers just complain, complain, and complain. ‚ÄúWhy did they use 2volt instead of what I thought it would be?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy is this scene not perfectly how I visualized it?‚Äù Like damn since you know exactly how you want the adaptation to be, how about you go do it yourself? No one but Mappa wanted to do the adaptation. Yea it‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs not ass either, far from it. MAL scores can attest to that. Y‚Äôall be so entitled thinking Mappa owe y‚Äôall something but they don‚Äôt. Some of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even support the author or watch the anime on official websites. You not doing shit for anybody or the series lmaoo. Of course there‚Äôs nothing wrong with criticism but it‚Äôs not cool when some of you guys kill anime onlies excitement. Just because you were disappointed(which is crazy), don‚Äôt make someone else feel like that."
Stjckman,StabnShoot,"If I'm watching the anime after reading the manga it's because I'm expecting the scenes to be more visually impressive. If it's just a slideshow of manga panels with some bad cg, then what's the point."
StabnShoot,Stjckman,"Okay I understand that but next week episode is when the real action starts. From the preview it looks like it‚Äôs going to be amazing, so we‚Äôll see. And for the CGI, I got used to it. Yea 2D is better than 3D but with the amount of action and titans that there‚Äôs going to be. I think CGI was the best way to go."
StabnShoot,_corgichubs,"I don't think the CG was bad lmao I hardly noticed its use in S4 so far; plus compared to the colossal titan CGI in S2, the titans we got in S4 looked downright amazing. Plus I guess the OST wasn't as ""overwhelming"" as I had thought it to be, but visuals of that scene were undeniably epic and one OST (mis?)use doesn't automatically invalidate the entire episode (like what some manga readers were saying)."
Stjckman,tasketekudasai,"""It's ok if you criticize it, just don't do it openly. Because yknow, that might kill the hype"" is one of the dumbest takes I've ever seen. None of things you said is a defense to anything. Doesn't change the fact that Mappa fucked this one up."
Stjckman,TheArchange1,"I get what you're saying but saying ""how about you go and do it yourself?"" is one of the laziest ways to deflect criticism. What do you expect them to do? Teach themselves how to draw to a professional level, get a job at a major anime studio, and happen to get chosen to work on their own adaptation? I don't think I need to point out how ridiculous that is."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_Omegon_,Dissapointed by OST and direction. Pretty meh episode. Hope the rest will be better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aDankSpazxtic,Wish there was more of the ost and that little bit of cgi looked slightly off but otherwise it was a brilliant episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,marctheguy,"I just need to comment on how insanely ballsy Eren is for this entire thing. He legit helped Reiner up, explained that they're the same, and then transformed into a Titan destroyed his home town in his face. Y'all can say what you want, but he's hardly a villain in my opinion."
marctheguy,Tidezen,"I think of Eren more like a Lex Luthor --certainly not evil, but definitely willing to go too far in pursuit of what he deems right."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,imsake,If you honestly think they picked the right ost just imagine if they played that ost when Bertholdt and Reiner destroyed wall Maria ... and before you say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a victory for eren and Co so that‚Äôs why they used that music‚Äù no...  this scene is supposed to show eren‚Äôs mental state slowing deteriorating showing he‚Äôs willing to kill innocent people...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Voi69,People in here dissing on 2Volt. You guys deserve some bonking!
Voi69,Sotterof1995,In my eyes 2Volt's second part is best used when a hero makes his comeback. That is why it was the best choice for when Levi tries to avenge his comrades against Zeke.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,harisaashraf7,"Underwhelming.
A word i never used with attack on titan till now."
harisaashraf7,Gabzy12,Agreed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hoetarosmithu,"Disappointing, just like meliodas vs escanor fight in anime form"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tigermafia42069,"Overall good but disappointed in the transformation music,i was expecting youseebiggirl"
tigermafia42069,aidree1,lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Magiox,Soulmadness did it better...this was a flop for an ending
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oliverrr918,This episode was so underwhelming for what it should be
oliverrr918,Gabzy12,Agreed but someone will come along and claim you don‚Äôt like it because you didn‚Äôt get youseebiggirl. They‚Äôre strawmanning bastards who can‚Äôt accept that we just can‚Äôt control what we like and we didn‚Äôt love this episode
Gabzy12,oliverrr918,"I think youseebiggirl shouldve been there, it wouldve been a nice parallel. And it's not to do with a hype eren war crime moment, i just feel it suits the sequence"
oliverrr918,Mr_1ightning,"I loved it and anime-onlies are in awe, idk what you're talking about"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,realeyon,"10/10. This is even better than the manga. Although they left out the convo between Magath and Willy which i think was very well written. But this way Willy death is more sudden. They also cut the switch to Zeke when the speech goes: ""I wished for the extinction of the Eldia"". Mappa tries to prevent that you could call Zekes betrayal like they did in the last episode when they cut out him playing Baseball with Colt. For me this is an improvement because it will hit different when you have absolutley no clue. I wish  that i could erase my memory so i would have experienced this point in the story the first time. I envy anime-onlies a lot."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LupusFidus,I had no idea there were so many directors and sound coordinators here. Just enjoy the show???
LupusFidus,nexuro01,We got used to bangers and hype so we expect bangers and hype
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gabzy12,"Transformation fell flat to me and was underwhelming. Thank god I made peace that Mappa had fucked up a lot before this point like in episodes 2 and 3 but I got hopeful after Ep 4 was so great. Sigh it‚Äôs whatever, I think it achieved its job for anime only‚Äôs but as a manga purist, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed 7.5/10"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chillininthebasement,OMG THAT WAS AMAZING.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PrasantGrg,Wow didn't realize episode dropped on nyaa so early today. Should be out on streaming sites really soon
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaiserigen,The only thing I don't like about MAPPA's adaptation is that they left the Ackerman Blood thing in Episode 2
Kaiserigen,Runbern,They'll probably explain it when 112 gets animated.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spoodern,Damn I was really hoping to hear YouSeeBIGGIRL for that scene
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sisifuzz,"I didn't see a single episode of this season yet, the strangest kind of lazyness I ever have"
Sisifuzz,Lhudooooo,you can just watch this one tbh. it feels like 5 mins fr
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KynoSSJR,"I‚Äôve watched a few times, OST works great. Builds tension and is quiet. Best animated episode until ‚ÄúIT CANT BE STOPPED ANYMORE‚Äù.

Reiners hand cusp was everything I needed"

tanhraaku,Reader575,Oh shit thanks hahaha
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RumbleMeDaddy,"The attention to detail... when Willy says ""I do not wish to die because I was born into this world, Eren's eyes widen."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Inraio,So I haven‚Äôt watched it yet but what exactly are people upset about in regards to the ost?
Inraio,SausageGuzzler69,"The OST in the declaration of war isn‚Äôt what they were hoping, it‚Äôs just the theme that plays in Levi vs Beast Titan.
Personally I watched an edit with Youseebiggirl and although that was slightly more ‚Äòepic‚Äô it didn‚Äôt rly feel appropriate or fit the tone in context imo so I‚Äôm still happy"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AlternativeNeither12,Only thing i didn‚Äôt like is the OST at the end. Like wtf? I hated that they used 2volt for Levi vs Zeke too
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Huhwtfbleh,"What an amazing episode. A but bummed about the bland OST but otherwise, historic anime epsiode. 

This episode completely changes the tone of the series, once again for the fourth time through its run."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,09jtherrien,"as an anime only practitioner, how did Eren gain control of the founding titan?"
09jtherrien,TheRealGarihunter,This is a manga spoiler sub so you should stay away if you don‚Äôt want to be spoiled
TheRealGarihunter,09jtherrien,yea i'm fine with spoilers for AoT.
09jtherrien,hi2colin,"Has the founding titan would be more accurate. He can't fully control it since he's not of royal blood, but that's also why he's not controlled by it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,THE_XENO_KING,No I'm not mentally unstable eo no I didn't cry but I did yell out of excitement Holy shit this episode was good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,irukasensei10,Loved every second of it however I feel that the soundtrack was kind of weak.. usually they build up the tension with the music but most of episode was without it...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Drumboardist,My brother is an Anime-Only.  [He just watched todays' episode.](https://imgur.com/ECJkGPT)
Drumboardist,llMadmanll,You kinda spoiled him tbh

Drumboardist,MoxofBatches,"I don't even consider Eren the villain. Ymir is the villain, Eren is just a puppet"
MoxofBatches,Drumboardist,"Eren is the Protagonist, Ymir is the villain, and Reiner -- bless his lil' heart -- coulda *actually* gotten his wish, but he protected Falco.  D'aaaaaw."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,marco_pucela,"I have an anime only friend, I'm wondering wether to let him watch the original episode or the edited ost one done by u/impetu0usness , I actually enjoyed the original episode, but after seeing it with the edit I liked the edit more. I want my friend to enjoy it the most, but don't want to bias him into any of the sides, which I thing the edit may do. What would you do guys?"
marco_pucela,killinrin,Definitely original! You can show him a different version later
killinrin,marco_pucela,"Yeah think I will do so, I can always so him the edit later on. I loved the episode anyways, even got goosebumps when eren was gonna transform! (and I hardly get emotional at all with any anime, film or series, so that's something)"
marco_pucela,Manatee_Ape,Just watch the original episode.
marco_pucela,shibboleth2005,The edit is great but it's definitely a fan effort. The mixing can be a lot better (mostly the music needs to be a lot quieter up until the end).
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maxo3D,"I remember how people downvoted for not liking MAPPA's vision on AoT. How did they managed to spoil such a brilliant entrance of Eren? Moment, when Eren stamps Willy to the ground... Damn, they somehow managed to fail it..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,UltraEM,"Yeah, the OST at the end felt underwhelming at first - partly because I've given myself really high expectations imagining the leaked OST or other songs playing instead. I feel like the very end should've been a bit more intense but otherwise it's great

Overall tho holy cow this episode took my breath away with its tension building. I was on the edge the whole time despite reading the chapter several times. Major hype for the next episodes"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,supern00b64,"Unfortunate music choice, but I think its more fitting and familiar for anime-onlies. My guess for where the livestream OST plays is during Sasha's death"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,q_uo,"[This fanmade animation of chapter 100 ending is better smh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=500N3UNA30k) 

They fucked up with the OST and most importantly the direction, the perspective is too narrow and they don't show [this full panel of Eren actually destroying the stage](https://youtu.be/500N3UNA30k?t=73) choosing instead to cut it into two shots - one of a closeup of Eren's face and other of his hand destroying the stage, with only the lower part of his titan on screen and then it cuts to him with his hands up with a squashed Willy. It's so much worse than the full panel of Eren's titan destroying the stage in the manga. They had one job to do this scene right and it was to follow the manga - and couldn't even do it right. 

Now come at me for making actual criticisim instead of mindlessly jerking off about how amazing MAPPA is. I didn't like it and I will say why I didn't like it because I'm F R E E."
q_uo,Final-Solid,You do realize that motion manga and anime is astronomically different right?
Final-Solid,q_uo,"I do, and that has no relevance to why they butchered [this glorious panel](https://imgur.com/a/mSXmRb3) into this [dusty, unclear abomination](https://imgur.com/a/Xh5SzjO). You can't see his body or head or even hand in this perspective. That panel was critical to the ambience of the scene and it's gone. Poof."
q_uo,alucidexit,"> Now come at me for making actual criticisim instead of mindlessly jerking off about how amazing MAPPA is.

Yeah I mean it's cool you provided your reasons, but those who like it aren't 'mindlessly jerking off' and you could cool your jets about that."
alucidexit,q_uo,"Yeah, that was unnecessary.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,selavit,when does the actual anime starts? at 16:10 or something?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kraker313,10 minutes left ü§©
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,Yess!!!! The tension is palpable.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Viffido,"They censured Eren killing the innocent people that were on the same building when he transformed.

I hope they don't try to whitewash Eren's actions."
Viffido,Micinak,"I mean the building got blown to shit, I dont think anyone will think those people are fine. For anyone doubting there will be Zofias legs sticking from under a rock next episode."
Micinak,Viffido,"Yes, but in the manga it shows the exact moment where those people (including children) blow up, I remember that being the first moment of shock where I realized that this was a darker Eren, but oh well."
Viffido,xxXMrDarknessXxx,How d you censor such a thing?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yobolay,"Man, I was worried about the war declaration because it really had some really tricky timing that would be hard to replicate in anime format, but that was way worse than I expected to be it, didn't help that they butchered the dialogue left and right."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LilEscobarz,"I don‚Äôt like being negative, but do they really have to ‚Äúrush‚Äù through the last season of arguably the most influential anime of the decade. Great episode with better pacing than the last few, but stuff being cut like Willy and Magath‚Äôs conversation on the horse caravan/Zeke looking back at the festival as Willy says he never should‚Äôve been born, just irks me, especially because it‚Äôs so important for the narrative. Can‚Äôt they just cut out the opening/ending and give us 5 more minutes of content? The anime is doing a great job in terms of animation and all that, but I‚Äôm still glad I read the manga before watching the anime. Manga version still stands superior in my opinion."
LilEscobarz,amuscularbaby,i would gamble that next episode starts with (or at least includes) a flashback to magath and willy in the carriage. keep in mind they rearrange scene sequences.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_-AK47,This episode was great. The only thing that make this episode drop down is the music. But for me 9/10.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nayurin,"Everything else was great, but if only they used either YouSeeBIGGIRL or the Declaration of War OST during the transformation scene, it would've been perfect."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cockdealer662,holy shit this sucked
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gasfar,"Built up ruined by rushed pace for the whole season, the ost choice is just bad and the animation didn't really improve the manga in any way, like what happened with Warrior.

It's not bad, but cmon."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bibbidybum,Y‚Äôall think this is underwhelming? [wait until you find out that this season will ONLY be 16 episodes with no part 2](https://comicbook.com/anime/news/attack-on-titan-final-season-how-many-episodes/)

BICbOi456,erehbigpp,I think it‚Äôs cause in the manga this was the most epic shit ever and in the episode it was kinda chill. Still loved it tho
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,"To be honest, with the latest chapter being mediocre and this episode falling a bit flat, my hype for the series has taken a beating. I would probably follow the manga till the end but the weekly anime anticipation has gone down notches.

We still have real life which is stranger than fiction. Don't know what reveals next week hold for us in the the world."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brezlynp,"honestly I think Mappa is just teasing by using an underwhelming OST. Think about it, we only saw the beginning of the mayhem and chaos that is about to ensue. Using such an epic buildup would kinda spoil it for the next episode, making it sound repetitive. I bet they are going to use it next episode just watch :)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Miniminji,Okay... the episode was underwhelming. The choice of music was not fitting. I think WIT would have made erens appearance more epic...
Miniminji,HistoriaIsTheMother,I don‚Äôt get why people are downvoting comments that have criticism
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sedjin,"That was really disappointing. 

How do you fuck up the transformation, while also nailing the buildup?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Icyblastz,trash
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,"The more I think about it, more I get mad.

Shit, the hype went down from 100 to 5 real quick. It's the same feeling that I  got after that infamous Winterfell battle. It's the sudden disillusionment when you start seeing things more rationally and judge them for what they are. Everything, from OP to titan designs to OST has been a fucking downgrade, but hype clouded the judgement. I don't blame Mappa as we cannot expect a completely new studio to replicate all the directorial choices of the previous one. I blame wit studio for being small, not expanding their headcount and the production committee for not choosing Araki to do storyboarding.
I don't even want to check the reaction videos and Facebook shitposting groups anymore. 

I Kneel before you WIT STUDIO sama!! And I will binge the Reiner reveal scene for 10 hours on loop to console myself. Please do a Final season brotherhood after 10 years once you hire more animators and improve your financials after making originals for Netflix."
jung2019,Animewe3b,Tf
Animewe3b,jung2019,Just venting my frustations here. Will be back to Normal once I finish rewatching S02E06 100 times tonight.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,viell,"Sometimes I can't believe the studio making snk is the same making jjk, the animation in jjk is fantastic even reminds me of mob psycho 100 in places. in snk it's so basic, in fact it's barely animating at all."
viell,Aarth1,JJK animation is nowhere near the level of mob psycho 100. Its good but not top tier.
Aarth1,viell,"mob's better i agree, that's why i said ""in places"""
viell,Final-Solid,This is over exaggerating lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chivarlyjack,"Not good enough, didn't feel same tension as in manga. Expecting better ost. The thing I like most is, they are actually showing eren like devil, sharp teeth and glowing eye etc. Need to re-watch with better subs."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gasfar,"Oh my god this past month I've read tens of people saying ""at least it's better than having so many still frames, like WIT did""

Hahahahahahahahha

Willy floating in the air is the funniest thing I have ever seen. Thanks mappa."
Gasfar,cegoousado,It's made to be that way tho? That scene isn't in real time.
Gasfar,Final-Solid,Bruh the only way to do that as the final frame is for it to be a still lmao. You have to linger on that shot for the chills to set in.
Gasfar,TheNinjaRaptor,I mean it still would've been a still image if it was WIT.
Gasfar,PrasantGrg,">Willy floating in the air is the funniest thing I have ever seen. Thanks mappa

That was literally the best part of the episode. 


Anyways I believe great stills is much better than only 'good' animation hence I prefer WIT by a heavy margin.


The stills from MAPPA this episode were pretty solid though so I have no visual complaints outside of Eren's model"
Gasfar,alucidexit,"> Willy floating in the air is the funniest thing I have ever seen. 

That's -- that's the final panel in the manga and is how it would've been presented had it been adapted by anybody lol what is this complaint"
Gasfar,chaderenabs,Bro the last panel was obviously gonna be a still panel anyway
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaibutsu_v2,"It's literally mindblowing how a fananimation is better than the actual FUCKIN STUDIO!!

In case you are wondering, watch Soulmadness video of chapter 100, the choice of OST and feel of it was 100000x better.

I was hesitant to say this through out the whole season, but MAPPA ruined AoT. what a waste of potential.."
Kaibutsu_v2,PinheadLarry_,Jesus Christ if this isn‚Äôt some major exaggeration
Kaibutsu_v2,DoItNowMikasa,"They also keep altering iconic lines.

I was waiting for ‚ÄúI just keep moving forward... Until all my enemies are destroyed.‚Äù

Honestly screw their version."
Kaibutsu_v2,DoItNowMikasa,Yeah. It feels like a solid 7/10 but could have been executed so much better. Everything feels dampened. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs Mappa though. Levi vs. Beast Titan was dampened. as all hell too. It‚Äôs Sawano.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TurbTheCurb,Oof you know the episode was mid just by looking at the front page of titanfolk - clips and pics from the episode are barely upvoted
TurbTheCurb,crimsonsecret7,Nah the episode was good but some people had really high expectations
TurbTheCurb,bitch_whip_bill,People are only just giving feedback. Give it chance
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TurbTheCurb,Y‚Äôall say the ost was great and didn‚Äôt need changing and I personally thought it did the job but you don‚Äôt see the 2volt DoW getting 3M+ views on YouTube like the youseebiggirl version üëÄ
TurbTheCurb,FruitJuicante,"By that logic, why didn't MAPPA use ""Kiss From A Rose"" by Seal lol?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StabnShoot,Y'all saying they did a good job animating the declaration when it's barely animated. Most of it is still frames. What a galactic disappointment.
StabnShoot,Raknel,Oh no they didn't animate the wind blowing Willy's hair in 60 FPS while he is standing still giving a speech. How will this anime ever recover /s
Raknel,StabnShoot,"Strawman argument that doesn't concern my complaint. Yep, that's a fanboy.

Come on. There were far less important scenes than this that looked a million times more impressive."
StabnShoot,kobriks,Did you just criticize Mappa on r/titanfolk?? How dare you?!?! Get on your knees RIGHT NOW and start sucking their dicks!
kobriks,StabnShoot,"The funny thing is that this sub jumped at Mappa's throats immediately when they made other mistakes like putting tons of CG in the first ep or cutting scenes, yet apparently this is not only fine but somehow a great job?"
StabnShoot,bubbygirll1234,Ikr im an anime only but when ep 3 came out i just could not stand the shit dull animation so i read the manga till chapter 100 and when i saw dat i thought: i have to see this shit animated fr! And reading the drums and trumpets part and i could already imagine how well that shit could be animated but the direction was so shit
bubbygirll1234,Raknel,"> Ikr im an anime only 

You really shouldn't be on this sub for your own sake"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,00pirateforever,"I just finished watching this episode. I generally watch the episode when it's air but I was busy today. 

This episode was very good in regards of story progression. There was very good scene here and there but for some reason I am disappointed with art and animation (although I am not going to complain that much since they didn't have time to began with). VA are so incredible, they bought the life to the story. 

The biggest disappointed with me was tension. This episode was for tension but I barely feel it. The ost choice was worst. This season ost are not good in most part but now the most important episode had weak ost made it like joke. The art and animation quality are not good compared to previous episodes. It seems like from now on we will going to get less quality episode. 

There was some scenes which was cut from manga in previous episodes makes Annie , Reiner and bert conversation pointless or not meaningful to me. If I was anime only then I might have not understood it. That scene was so much important for character development ( to understand character).  And there was few scenes which was cut but not that important was discussion between Willy and Theo.

The best part of this episode was eren development. He acted only after declaration of war. He even was clam as fuck compared to previous seasons where he was so impulsive. The titan design was afüî•. Looking forward for war hammer titan. If next episode was done right, it might go down as best episode till now.

**BRING THE FUCKING OLD OST FOR GOD SAKE. AOT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT TENSION AND TENSION ONLY COMES FROM GOOD OST.**"
00pirateforever,Zybloks,"I agree with the ost point but I somehow fail to understand what you mean by the art and animation being disappointing? I think they did a fairly good job, given how they used colours and drew impactful expressions.

I also don't get what you mean when you say that they cut scenes that made the RBA convo pointless. I don't think they cut anything relevant to the conversation, they showed the whole scene where the trio talks to the old man. The only scene concerning RBA that they cut was Annie baiting mindless titans when Bert broke Shinganshina's gate or am I missing something?"

morgoth834,liliks,"it's not that you don't see what they're talking about , more like you're dismissing it. i'm more disappointed in this sub than the episode itself . why are the people complaining and/or criticizing certain things are being treated like they're crazy ? is criticism forbidden in this sub ? maybe a newAOT sub should be created especially for the criticism where people will feel more comfortable talking about it and where they will not be silenced by dislikes . 

I can't believe people who say that the OST is perfect  ,the fog overlay is perfect and that  Eren's transformation was perfect .it was not . Criticism is part of the fandom,why try to silence it . Also what's with this trend of people being asked to be grateful/happy , ect 

why is it suddenly ok to tell people how they should feel about this? art is subjective . 

personally , as a manga reader,  this episode bored me . dislike me to oblivion if you like but please don't tell me how i should feel . i will feel the why i feel just like you do . if you're already happy  about this then consider yourself happy , don't make the people who are unhappy about this even more unhappy , they're not doing it to you ."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YakiBacki,"There were no suicide bomber Eldians in the manga, but Mappa just had to add it. Quickly shows how much Marley thinks of Eldians.

This Season will be 16 episodes and will probably end around 122. Yes, the rest of the manga after that will eventually be animated, but we don't know HOW that'll happen. There's no confirmation of a split cour, a cour 2 or movies, so it's literally anyone's guess right now.

Also, this new OP rocks.

Edit: 16 episodes has now been confirmed by the Blu-ray announcement. And to reiterate, for now, no one (and that probably includes MAPPA) has any idea what comes after these 16 episodes."

aDankSpazxtic,RokiSmiles,"I feel this way too. While I was reading this part in the manga, I was annoyed by Gabi, but I *really* enjoyed her in the episode... could just be because I know what‚Äôll happen but... her little run/cheer back to the trenches after blowing up the train was really cute."
aDankSpazxtic,OranNee,"I feel like this aswell but since I watched the show with my anime only friend, I feel like I like them better becuase I know the full arc of each character."

Okay977,Wingleesharm,Good catch
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,impetu0usness,"Dudes, the directing and soundtrack of the second half was absolutely superb. Everything starting from Zeke's scream until the end, including Reiner's entrance and battle, was very well paced with some added scenes that made it awesome. I had my gripes with the 3DCG Titans but after a few viewings it wore off and I could enjoy the episode for what it was. A great pilot episode.

Edit: I'm rewatching that part like it's 2017 again and Reiner and Bertholdt just got revealed. Well done MAPPA."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"So with that weird Falco dream, Yams basically used the anime to spoil us manga readers. What a god."
Clemenx00,SolemnDemise,I think people are forgetting whose titan Falco gets. There *was* a survey corps member that Falco could/would get memories from that isn't Eren.
SolemnDemise,kk_victory,"That makes sense, but how does he have those memories BEFORE inheriting the jaw? PATHS?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DialedWrongNumber,"That was a really good ep!!

They cut some Colt/Magath internal talks during the battle. From those cut talks, I really missed the one that provided suspense for the airdrop. 

I did like the original scenes with Reiner fighting within the fort. I kinda do wish they showed him using the radio tower as his weapon. 

I really do like the 2D animation, I don't mind the 3D models it will just take some getting use to."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bohem1an_fapsody,"Watched with my anime-only girlfriend and one of her main takeaways after the episode was, ""God that Gabi girl is super annoying"". So it begins..."
bohem1an_fapsody,Chaos-Reach,"Fuck  Gabi, all my homies hate Gabi"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,richardtengcy,The new OP is supposed to be a theme for a new start that bring the viewers to the perspective of the great nation Marley so I think the choice of not using Linked Horizon who have been singing the OP for the Scouts at Paradis is really appropriate.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,The Falco memory and his overt presence in the ending makes me thing this is yet another case of hidden spoilers even for manga readers lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,XenoEclipse,Didn't expect they'd go with Jean!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xin234,"The thing I really anticipate most is... Whatever Isayama decides to open season 4 with.  


Season 3 opened with stuff from season 3's end. Considering Season 4 is the last, I kinda want it to open with the final panel of the manga that he showed 2 years ago.  


Anything else... Is also acceptable."
lawncorazon,HitchikersPie,"Feeling cute, might kill Sasha later"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vecus,BRO WTF Falco had a dream about being a Survey Corps member!? That wasn't in the manga right?
Vecus,CarnFu,My dumbass thought he meant he had a sword in his flying titan form like a big ass titan sword.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DoItNowMikasa,"I just realized the smoke in the opening represents the fog of war. It will gradually be lifted each episode.

It coincides with the pervasive ‚Äòwho is the real enemy?‚Äô questioned throughout the show."
DoItNowMikasa,Bunz4sale,"I just came to this discussion to comment this. I honestly think as the season goes on, all those parts of the OP with the encroaching smoke will be replaced with the rumbling!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrDollSteak,"I'll be honest, I might have like terrible eyes or something, but I straight up didn't even notice it was CGI until like one or two frames with the Beast Titan. The animation was absolutely incredible! The battle was excellent, with all of the titans managing to feel threatening and powerful even when going up against soldiers and armoured trains. Can MAPPA please go back and fix up the Colossal Titan from Season 2 and 3 for like a complete season blu-ray boxset or something now that they're on the production committee?

In all seriousness, I thought it was a great episode. I have full confidence in MAPPA going forward. It condensed the two chapters really well, and managed to fix all of the few issues that I had with the chapters in the manga itself, in terms of the tone and dialogue. I think that rather than feeling like an exposition dump this episode actually felt like a logical sequence in the progression of the overall story. The explanations about why the war was happening, why they were there, and who all the characters were, felt far more natural, and as a result my interest and engagement with the battle itself was much higher.

Controversially, I also think the nods to later chapters, Falco's vision, and Jean buying the newspaper were excellent touches, that also helped to sell why these sequences are important in the overall context of the narrative, and made Falco's introduction in particular, feel a lot more like a main characters by having some clear parallels to Eren's dream with Mikasa.

I really don't understand the criticisms about the OP or the other music throughout the episode, I felt like everything slapped. In all honesty, this OP is easily in my top 3 of what we've seen so far. It captured the more technological feel of this arc as well as the existential dread that defines it, in comparison to the upbeat medieval ones of previous seasons, and the explosions of colour on otherwise statue-like graphics was a fantastic contrast in my opinion. I also imagine some of these explosions will be toned back in later episodes as more information and battles are had, not that in my mind this really needs to happen as I think its fine regardless. It feels like its for a completely different anime granted, but I don't consider that a negative at all, because that's exactly how I felt about the overall story after reading chapters 90 and onwards. Everything that came before now feels more like the prequel to the ACTUAL action, and I think this mature and gritty direction is far superior.

Overall, I'm just so excited that this is actually happening. It's surreal that as the manga is ending we have the final season coming out, and it is so far, absolutely incredible as an adaptation, and as Isayama says the 'final' version of the story. Full disclosure, I felt the same way about Season 3, and thought that it was overall much better than the equivalent manga chapters throughout apart from the occasional 'Ereh' criticisms about Mikasa's characterisation. Nevertheless, I am fully expecting that Season 4 will be the perfect end to this story!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AleXstheDark,"The opening is absolute fire. Imperialistic, chaotic, and contrast absolute destruction with a colorful palette."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,clorox_baratheon,"F for a user from r/anime:

> Think I just found my next favorite character along with Sasha, Hange, and boy Erwin R.I.P."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Demetriade,"Can I say that I'm really *really* looking forward to Eren and Reiner confrontation? Like I heard how he was talking to Reiner in the trailer and it was like he's dead inside. 

Also falco and Eren conversation about how life can't be taken for granted. But you have to keep moving forward. 

Tbh, Eren in these chapters is üëå/üëå"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Crisisofland,holy shit no censorship?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinkdaisiesss,"The episode felt like it was 10 minutes long. 

Gabi's VA sounds fantastic. Seeing and hearing Reiner made me so happy.

The Jaw Titan was a standout for me in this episode. The fast movements were done really well. The CGI was noticeable with the Beast Titan's slower movements, but I didn't find it distracting. 

My man Jean at the end (!), I quite like that addition. I'm not sure what to make of Falco's daydream tho.. foreshadowing?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,halotx3,"I think the CG is gonna take a while to get used to. I can see where they switch from CG to 2d and vice versa but after watching Wit for so long its a jarring transition.

The CG of Mappa has more weight than wits limited CG but its just weird because when there is an error it just stands out more, I think Reiner waving and the Zeke coming down as best were the worst. So as long as the action sequence's maintain the quality that was in this ep earlier we should be fine."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisuthepretty,"This episode accurately showcases the world's hatred for Eldians. The Eldians were used as suicide bombers, suicide titans, etc. without second thoughts for their lives. It was really sad to witness them die as tools. 

The scene of the Eldian man kissing the photo locket around his neck, which most likely held a photo of his wife or family members, before charging out to die was really heart breaking. He knows he will die as a tool and he will never see his family again. Also he most likely knew his death wouldn't amount to much or change how the world views Eldians but he gladly did it anyways for his family to have a better life than before. That's probably another reason why he kissed his necklace. He was doing it for them.

The Eldians were told their deaths would be meaningful but that isn't the case at all. Marley (and the world) will still see them as Eldian devils even though they are helping their oppressors to win a war. Even though Marleyans need them to survive, they treat them like crap. It's really sad. 

I loved this episode so much though it was amazing. I rate it 9/10."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Icy313,"GOOD CGI!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SilverInfo,"People here discussing the CG are neglecting the fact that MAPPA in particular is one of the few anime studios that already have established my trust in using CG in animes. They did Dorohedero and it had amazing blending of CG and 2D animation.

I think all and all it will look good. Maybe just a few angles looking slightly janky, but in action sequences expect things to flow well."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,"The CGI was fairly competent. I think people are just so instinctively against the idea of CGI that they're unwilling to adjust. That said, the Beast Titan did feel like the worst of the new models. I think he was the most jarring but the rest looked fine. The sequences of the Jaw Titan were especially great."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DisgorgeX,"Ya know, when I see her in motion and hear her voice, I kinda like Gabi. Reminds me a lot more of Eren this go around compared to her introduction in the manga. Especially her eyes when she talks about killing all the devils on the island. Serious shades of ""I'LL KILL EVERY LAST TITAN!"" Eren."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,"The OP feels like a creepy, trippy WW2-era propaganda video, which is weirdly fitting lol."
Final-Solid,moving_asunder,"I very much think they were going for the angle that the first soldiers entering WW1  (WW2 also) were promised an adventure, all the explosions are presented in a colourful and fun way, Marleyan propaganda. Just fantastic."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chokkolate,"I loved the opening. It's creepy, and it's clearly a change of tone from those epic Linked Horizon openings, like all those soldiers appearing courageously and fighting, offering their hearts and everything else. There¬¥s no glory here, only horror. 

The scene with those corpses with open mouths and hands up to the air resembled Pablo Picasso's Guernica a lot - which is also a work of art that criticizes the horrors of war. 

The chapter...the animation is beautiful. Even the CGI is beautiful. The VA's performance was also solid. Not sure about the OST yet, though. I'll wait a bit more to have a definitive opinion."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,namatt,"The opening shot is great. High pitched buzzing, explosions, Falco, Eldian soldiers dead on the ground, Eldian soldiers flying, soundtrack, machine gun, Colt!, run for your life!

OP is ok-ish. It gets better once the explosions stop, peaks at the last 15 seconds, when they build up to showing the Attack Titan.

Gabi and Falco's VA were great. VA's for pretty much everyone did a very good job. Gabi's laugh after derailing the armored train made me squeal in delight, no joke, and I'm a guy so that's rare for me.

Jaw Titan looked great, Cart and pure titans were passable, the bigger titans were lackluster. Unfortunately, it will probably be the same for the Warhammer, Attack Titan etc. I didn't even notice Jaws was CGI at first. But Beast and Armored are an eye sore any time they move.

ED is par for the course. Outstanding just like every previous ED.


**TLDR; great opening episode, hope the CGI gets better for the big titans.**"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RazorStrider_Hugo,"I love how they retained the 'Information Available for Public Disclosure' section among others, proof of how serious MAPPA's dedication is to keeping the series as close as possible to WIT's magic and ingenuity. The action scenes had me on the edge of my seat and boy was the soundtrack that glorious! I'm especially impressed with the mindless titans' transformation sequence with those blinding lights, smoke cover and the final reveal of a titan biting the air in anticipation of its human meal. The coloring is the only downside for me but nevertheless, it was a bomb of an episode and a showcase of the new studio's great potential in taking the final season into greater heights. A week can't come soon enough. A+!"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Thirsty-Watermelon,"What I've noticed this episode is that the CGI gets more awkward the bigger and less detailed the titans are. Like, the Jaws and Cart look absolutely phenomenal for CG, had me even  questioning if some of the shots are actually CG or not. The Armored Titan looks really good in most shots and especially the transformation shots. But I still can't get over the Beast Titan. The CG looks really awkward, especially on the face and the landing sequence. I think the  Beast Titan is really my only complaint about the CG, but I'm alright if they just polish it up later on and move forward. This does make me a bit worried about the Warhammer and Attack Titan fight though, since those two are pretty simple in terms of design, so CG might be much more noticeable."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NIssanZaxima,"MAPPA erased any doubt that i had about this season with this episode. Sure, some of the CG stuff did look wonky but overall I couldn't even tell in a lot of parts it was CG. The CG is 1 billion times better than WIT's CG. The Armored Titan's rework is gorgeous. 

The biggest concern I had was the music because in my opinion that is what made WIT's adaption so good, was their perfectly placed soundtracks. The track leading up to the aerial bombardment could not have been better and I know we will still get those great tunes during epic moments of this season.

Overall 9/10"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShingekiNoEren,"When I saw people in this thread complaining about the CGI, I got worried. The only other experience with CGI this show has had was the S2 and S3 Colossal Titan, and yeah, that wasn't good. But I watched the episode and I don't see why people are complaining so much. The Titan CGI was perfectly fine. Way better than WIT's CGI. The only shot that looked kinda weird was the part where Reiner was waving on Zeke to come down from his parachute and transform. But that's not a deal breaker."

God tier CG, especially for The Armored and Beast titans, the guns/cannons, Porco and Pieck were also good CG, but nowhere near the others. (Kinda reminded me of JJBA CG tbh)

Nice voice acting 

Overall very fluid animations, obviously going to take some getting used to but it‚Äôs certainly for the better

ED and OP sounded great, kinda dissatisfied with the OP visuals though.

Music was really good sounding, though did feel a bit out of place sometimes.

Pretty nice pacing as well.

And I‚Äôm 100% sure that was Jean at the end there."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,"I know they are in minority, but people over praising wit need to revisit Rots arc and see how jaggy the beast titan's rock throwing animations were. Even on the low quality stream, his animations today looked really smooth. Don't get me started on Colossal CGI.

Other complaints are kinda fair, OP visuals could have been better but whatever."

Gabi breaking 4th wall with explaining world affair circumstances was kinda meh but whatever. Everything else was mind blowing. I'm so glad Mappa showed balls and wasn't afraid of showing war/blood/death/suicidal charges scenes."
Justified_Eren,Vihurah,"honestly i forgot to mention that. this season doesnt shy away from the death. i totally expected them to pan away when that guy got chomped, but no, ***snap***. that bodes well for the rest of the season, since alot of the best moments rely on being shown in their full glory."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,acacount,The anime does a better job at showing how agile the jaw titan is
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BioLizard18,"I can't believe anyone out there thought this wouldn't be good. I am glad to have held out hope! This was amazing!  


Main observations:  
God, this episode also reminded me of just how awful Magath was early on in the series.  


The final shot of the navy's destruction from beneath the sea after Zeke bombards them was KILLER. Like, wow, this is what an anime adaptation of a manga is all about - giving new and unique perspectives on the scenes we love.  


Another great adapted scene was Reiner's mid-air transformation. Showing the armored form around him as he falls, and the pose... so damn cool!  


I also like the new visual for ""inside a titan"" a lot. The WIT style wasn't bad but... it always seemed weirdly roomy in there. Mappa's style makes it feel like a really cramped and, for lack of better word, gross space with all the innards and veins all over the screen. I like that a lot!  


CG was noticable during Reiner and Porco's assault on the fort especially, but otherwise was good. Not mind-blowing, but rarely got in the way.  


I actually really love the opening. In my ideal AoT opening it is either ridiculous and epic like Linked Horizon or does WEIRD SHIT and this is definitely a certified WEIRD SHIT opening and I am here for it. I just wish there was a bit more symbolism. This is gonna be sooo controversial though I can tell!  


The ending on the otherhand, we've only seen partially, but we can see Ymir and paths in it so that's enough for me!  


Voice actors were amazing, and the episode looked consistently great too.  


The teaser with Jean at the end was interesting too. I always thought it was implied the Paradis scouts had infiltrated Marley for a while but... to see it actually confirmed was cool!  


Overall, I really enjoyed it! I can't wait for more! The declaration of war is gonna be incredible."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FlameCorre,"Ayane Sakura's portrayal of Gabi is really accurate to her character. She went from voicing cinnamon rolls like Uraraka to a baddass, yet annoying girl like Gabi. I REALLY hope she will not get death threats when the later episodes come out. I don't want this to become Laura Bailey in Last of Us 2 type of scenario... 

Magath's voice actor is a great one too! He portrayed the actual voice my mind would give whenever he says something in the manga.

Have to get used with the CGI animation for the Titans, but their usage is still beautiful in my eyes.

Also, they managed to give hype to both anime-onlys and manga readers. The dialogue on Falco saying he flies with swords can be both forshadowing for the future chapters/episodes or just a fourth wall break for the animal onlys because of the change of perspective.

The opening gives a war-like tone, like it tells the story is not about eliminating Titans anymore, but in a much wider perspective of war between two sides. And the ending song just gives the usual Attack on Titan vibes: suffering and depression. 

Overall, you've done well, MAPPA, voice actors, and the music coordinators. Looking forward with the future ones!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,I like the flex with eyes in the first scene. It felt like a statement from MAPPA to some people that we can do eyes too lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,Cool detail: The addition of Jean at the end implies that he learned how to read Marleyan during the timeskip.
sharethebear1,Gnomemann,They have the same language though. If you are referring to the canned herring from season 2 im assuming another country manifactured it and its being sold in Marley.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AirRave,"Mappa didn't disappoint! Reiner's transformation was so damn badass. Is it just me, or does Magath kinda look different from the manga?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kutaz65,The only thing that I didn't like about the episode was that Zeke's CGI was wonky at times. Otherwise it was just what I wanted it to be.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SmoothShark,"This is completely nit picky but I wish they added an effect to Zeke's scream.  Theres a fan made manga panels version on youtube that made his scream so good.

It just sounds like a normal scream, it should be something unique."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,invaderzz,"Fucking AMAZING episode and OP/ED. I literally cannot believe that this series is getting a full, amazing adaptation"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheWhiteApe2237,I loved the episode all together. I think there were parts where the cgi looked clunky though. Some of the Jaw Titans animations looked awkward. The Armor looked weird half the time and good the other half. The Beast looked a bit jarring as well. The pure titans looked great though and the character designs are fantastic. I just hope they clean up the cgi for some of the later battles.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kayounenka,"I feel so hurt now TT\_\_\_TT after watching the ep 60 and then reminiscing the older chapters, it's so hurt to see how some of them aren't there anymore. I just hope the anime will use less comical anime tropes further on the story since it's becoming way more serious now.

Grice bros the best bros... I missed Colt so much

Anyway can't wait to see Pieck and Porc"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,alisonburgersm8,"The CGI looks great to be honest. There are a couple of movements with the Armor that look wonky and noticeable, but the rest are amazing, especially in all the scenes with the Jaw. Beautiful stuff."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vihurah,"so going through more thoroughly the CGI has its problems. but of course it does, we knew this.

i think the 2 places it stuggles most at the moment is hair and movement.

the fact that the titans on some frames hop between being animated at 24 frames and 12 is something that can really take you out of the scene, especially so when going from fast movements to calm. reiners roll to avoid the train is a good example of this. flows alright, but the animation is very start/stop as soon as the movement is over.

also hair. I think this is the most jarring thing, and why the beast titan specifically is called out as an issue. the Shaders themselves are good, but the way the hair on the titans moves needs a bit of work, since it can really desync with the motion sometimes. 

all in all, its still pretty damn good cgi"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ra_Artifex,The cgi in the ep was surprisingly good.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aliskevo,Holy shit MAPPA did such a great job in this first episode-- I didn't find anything wrong with the CGI components at all... Can't wait until we get a glimpse of Eren!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,anakin_solo17,The cgi was pretty good. Personally I think it looked better than the collosal titan cgi. However I still prefer it when we got drawn titans and one Cgi titan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bacontobaconeggtoegg,any manga readers finding it weird how anime watchers get main cast in episode 1 and we had to sit there for a year (??) without a single glimpse of anyone from Paradis
bacontobaconeggtoegg,readwriteread,"Nope, I am perfectly happy the story has improved so that more people can enjoy the mindfuckery to come"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,it would be cool if each episode had one more detail showing up in the OP
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ElMondoH,"Would folks be willing to expand on what they found wrong with the cgi? I didn‚Äôt think it was all that bad, especially compared to the prior season‚Äôs use.

No, I‚Äôm not saying those opinions are wrong. Rather, I‚Äôm just trying to get a deeper explanation for that point of view. It‚Äôs about learning what others see, and using that info to inform my viewing in the future."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aph223,"After rewatching the episode in 1080p on a big screen, I don‚Äôt mind any of the CGI Titans, even the Beast Titan that I initially thought looked pretty janky. I got used to the CGI pretty quickly, and I think I‚Äôm gonna be completely fine with it moving forward."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rock_D_Bayar,"To the people whose are complaining about the CGI titans, i dunno man. Take a look at berserk adaptation 2016, it was a real struggle... For me titans looked amazing in cgi. It was more than enough. And those extra jaw titan scenes were wild af."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wmh206,It's honestly very funny to read anime-onlies' praising of Gabi and saying that she's their new favorite character. Oh you poor sweet summer children...
wmh206,Everdale,"Ha, a friend of mine messaged me saying, ""I already love Gabi"". It's going to be a rollercoaster lol."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yanneur,BETHOLDTO
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ash111098,Was actually an amazing episode. However the cgi Titan shifters make me worried for future episodes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fqrlhznl,at first I was put off by the overuse of CG in that fort battle but then I remembered what kind of shit they have to animate further on now.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vihurah,"Im starting to think... itd be amazing if the Opening was actually a fog of war, and the reused explosions and cloud shots are actually stand ins for other shots that will be added as the season goes on.

imagine the eren scene at the end of part 1 but hes surrounded by colossal titans during the rumbling with the hardening cracking away"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bensor74,"Just seen the episode. I didn't notice any bad CGI. Y'all overdoing it, just enjoy the fucking show for once."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DinoLaserFight,"Can we take a moment to appreciate that credit sequence?!?  Really pretty, kinda reminds me of the titan spine tree with ymir. Also AOT is very good at hinting at future events in the series through their credits."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,realeyon,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TolbTZXDjI&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TolbTZXDjI&feature=youtu.be)  


OPENING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,It‚Äôs funny how I see the same names on this sub always complaining lol be it the anime or the manga
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Psychological_Pop_60,"I haven't seen everything yet, but I liked it. My Jean, Reiner and Zeke are perfect‚ù§

About the Titans ... I really hope they animate at least Titan Warhammer in 2d. The best for me was the Porco, but Zeke and Reiner were just ...

About op and ed. The op is different, but I really liked it. I hope they add the characters, it would be cool. And ed is just perfect, I downloaded the song and I'm listening over and over lol. The Phoenix and the tree of the paths were beautiful. I don't need to talk about my boy Falco‚ù§

I really want to see Ymir in action!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Master3530,"Gabi really is an epitome of ""geneva conventions? more like geneva suggestions"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,clorox_baratheon,i got teary when i heard reiner talk. ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mnabil01,"With the Jean cameo at the end, does this mean they already infiltrated Marley? That's earlier than I thought"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,H-K_47,My whole self is screaming in hype while my inner Jaegerist is screaming in fear that Falco is gonna eat Eren.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,N1COLAS13,"I can totally see how the CGI titans look odd to some people. They don't look bad imo but definitely different. We'll get used to it the more we see them, I think.

I'm guessing the battle in Liberio will be in two weeks? Anyway, watching this animated gave me that same ""is this really the same series"" feeling I got when I first read chapter 90, it was awesome"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turboswag420,"The CGI is the best i think ive seen in an anime, it looks very candid, especially with drawing hard lines on the models to look like a character from the anime. It isnt the worst thing in the world, but im very worried for the big Paradis battle and having to see all the titan fight‚Äôs in CG model :( 

Monkeh looked bad at parts, Reiner and Galliard looked pretty good. While watching i couldnt help but feel that WIT couldve done astronomically better, but i suppose there isnt much to be done about it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,methofthewild,"So people are talking about (potential future manga spoilers about falco) >!Falco inheriting the Attack titan because he had visions about flying and swinging blades, and the only titan that is able to pass memories back in time is the attack titan.!< If people are correct about this, dang they are smart for figuring it out but also I haaaaateee them for spoiling this for me. Someone please convince me that this doesn't make sense."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BossAtlas,"MAPPA is fucking CRUSHING it. I was blown away by this episode, all of my doubts are gone. This was beautiful. Absolutely incredible."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rodranime,Falco's line wasn't in the manga right? The line of fighting with two swords?
Rodranime,RommyRomRoms,"Isayama changes the manga, the anime is where isayama revises or he planned as the final structure of the story"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,N1COLAS13,"I fear for the safety of half this subreddit
if that ""Falco eats Eren"" theory comes true"
N1COLAS13,AvalancheZ250,"Eh, its Titanfolk. Crackpot theories are just our thing. Most end up being flat out wrong, but when one of them hits gold the memes are glorious. 

Don't worry about the safety or health of this community. We are all crazy anyway."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Derkadur97,"Wtf was Jean doing there at the end? It‚Äôs a small detail but the implications are big, isn‚Äôt the whole survey Corp supposed to be on the island?"
Derkadur97,Fuiger,"Survey corps were already at Marley when they got the letter, Marley doesn't do shipping to Paradis lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Snaxia,I loved this episode! The CGI was really good for the most part and I can't get enough of the opening and ending.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Anirakkarina,"Manga readers, did you notice when Falco said, ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt I flying around with a sword just now? Like, whoosh! And there were titans that I -‚Äú ...."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,notanfbiofficial,The CG titans were actually great wow I completely trust Mappa to deliver now
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"Comments here had me worried but just saw it and the shifters look amazing, anyone else agrees?

People just overreacting. Only with Beast it was obvious that it was CGI but the rest had me fooled."
Clemenx00,Collection_of_D,"People have just been scarred too many times by CGI anime so most on first sight will immediately throw up insults cause they can only think about the bad (beserk, overlord season 3)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zbearbear,"My thought process

1. That's one spicy OP

2. The Gabi hate train is officially in town all aboard fuckers 

3. Galliard is a walking slashing Maybelline commercial and I love it.

4. M O N K E

5. ""Armored"" Titan

6. Is that CGI? Not Bad imo

7. Was that Jean at the end???

8. Wasn't expecting the ending but not bad at all. 


Give me the Declaration of War already! My body is 
R E A D Y"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,~~Typeset~~ Subtitles gang just gauging everyone else's opinions. Seems good.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ForeverAkatsuki,"ED sounds like one of those Indie songs, I like OP better. Maybe need more visuals to convince. That CGI is not the best I've seen, but it definitely gave me goosebumps. Reiner and Zeke look so alike lol, and there's Colt who also kinda look like them."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GaaraOmega,"6th OP is pretty much Marley‚Äôs theme, and I kind of dig it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Collection_of_D,$10 bet that in about 4 weeks everyone will be drooling for the season 4 opening like what has happened with the last 2-3 intros.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kertopenix,"So considering that 16 episodes have been announced so far how many chapters do we think this is going to cover? I‚Äôm assuming of course that this is not the whole season but just part 1.

With a steady pace of 2 chapters per episode, the part could end with chapter 122 and neatly set up the rumbling arc. This is super fast but there are a lot of action scenes and they might cut/compress some parts of the Marley arc.

It might also end with chapter 113/114 with Erens escape/Pieck/spinal fluid wine as a cliffhanger and the Zeke/Levi forest confrontation as an action-heavy mid-season finale. That would give them more leeway and make for a more even split."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeNooYah,"Hulu and Crunchyroll currently showing a drop down for Season 4, but both are empty as of when they appeared 5 mins ago"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Beans_37,Yooo falco said ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt i just flying around with a sword and there were titans?‚Äù
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skyclad__Observer,"Genuinely very impressed by this episode. The CGI was a little weird in parts, but they actually used it to make some really impressive high-speed action that I just don't think would have been possible in 2D. To me 3D shouldn't be used unless it can justify its inclusion, and MAPPA looks to be doing that so far. The environment design and background art are both incredible, I think this might be my new favorite art style aside from Season 2. The color palette too is a big step away from WIT's brighter/sharper choices, but it worked phenomenally well in Slava, and contributed to the feeling that this was an actual battlefield. Another thing I noticed was a few decent moments of character animation, which is relieving because I was worried there might be *too* many static conversations. Hope they can keep it up. I was glad to hear at least one old track as part of the music, but the newer stuff worked well for this particular episode even if it was a bit different than Sawano's usual stuff. Sound design was great too, with the constant sounds of war in the background. 

Directing was good as well, even though this episode wasn't directed by Hayashi. Well paced both in terms of dialogue and action, and some interesting shot composition here and there as well. I especially loved the aerial shots of Fort Slava, the silhouetted shot of the Mid-East forces walking back and forth on the walls, the POV cut of the Mid-East soldier mowing down Eldians with that machine gun, and the shots leading up to the drugged Eldians being thrown off the airship."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sketchaire,"Wow, I was glued to the screen the whole time! Amazing art, story, pacing, music...where to even start? Such a gruesome, realistic portrayal of a WWI era battle: the trenches, the shell shock, armored tanks, the rifle and machine gun action...everything. I‚Äôm amazed and in awe of MAPPA and what they did here. It exceeded every expectation I had. Bravo!!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,clorox_baratheon,yeah gabi and magath's voices are great. but can we talk about how perfect zofia's voice is?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,160048,"i'm gonna have to grow on the cgi, everything does look different, but overall it was really good."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BolZac,"Everything except maybe some weird beast titan scenes with cgi, which i dont really mind, is fucking phenomenal. From voice acting, facial expressions, design, animation and music/sound. I loved it and i have even more faith in Mappa!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,whalebeefhooked223,Was the line about falco remembering flying around with swords in the manga? It kinda gives me paths vibes
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Cersei505,Today is a good day to be an AoT fan.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Martin7431,"""children cling to their very last coins"" in the opening like Halil and Ramzi"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ANINETEEN,"We trusted MAPPA and they DELIVERED üî• This was exactly the perfection I expected from the first episode. The OST and score, the art and CGI, the OP and ED were literally all so clean and deep. They had the tension getting my heart beating the entire time. Literal dropped us into the clusterfuck. Gabi doing her thing and then the Jaw Titan, Reiner and Zeke entrance just gave me chills. And gosh that ED song and music is just beautifully executed. We in for a real ride üòÅ"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Edirneli,Jaw titan looks so fcking good but monke a little bit weird lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,"actually on the second thought i feel like it woukd have fit better had they put that jean hint like 2nd or 3rd ep, id appreciate it more if they let the viewers sink in this new marley setting first before getting into ideas like 'WHERE TEAM PARADIS'"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Psychological_Pop_60,"Reviewing the Titan of the Porco their movements are very good, really. It looks very 2D. The only problem was BT. But Reiner in many scenes also looked incredible. It's just the custom."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ClausMcHineVich,"I was legitimately pissing myself at Gabi's lines, can't get over how likeable they've made her in just the first episode. Can't wait for Meatbowl to see anime onlys reaction to her, and see if the hate is as vitriolic as it was on here for ages"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSealTamer,"Finally saw it, and honestly I loved it. While ima not a fan of the op I absolutely love the Ed. The only cgi ‚Äúproblem‚Äù was that the beast Titan looked a bit off. Honestly with just some darker fur he‚Äôll look fine. Reiner as the armored looks way better here than he‚Äôs ever looked IMO. Absolutely crisp. The trailer soundtrack playing while Reiner assaulted the fort was well done. Some great hype. I also like his extended fight with the second armored train. We get to see some glorious Pieck booty next episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,I‚Äôm surprised at how reactions to the new OP are hit or miss. That shit slaps yo. Personally find the ED to be good-ish and everyone seems to love that.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaximusPrime987,Episode 1 is already a massive W for Jean fans
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,veryearlypotato,"The ending feels like... Dejavu? Like I have seen and heard something very very similiar but I can't really picture it.

The closest I could think of is zankyou no terror op"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,motofreakz,YARUNDANA? IMA? KOKO DE??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheAceBoi,"So assuming part 1 has 16 episodes, and they adapt an average of 2 chapters per episode, part 1 will end on >!Eren‚Äôs head getting blown off!<"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ivonnii,I love that they used the trailer music as a ost
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BusterR91,I loved the portrayal and voice acting of Gabi this episode. Especially the laugh when she blew up the train!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Adorable-Dish,"As much as i am sad that mappa discarded all the animated jaw and cart scenes in the pv, it was a good decision. Constant switching between cg and hand-drawn is a complete fuckfest for the eyes"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,"CG was mostly good. Odd in some places ie. the titan freefall from distance view, unnaturally stiff kinda like action figures were just dropped. Love Zook, Gabi, Reiner, and Magath‚Äôs character design. Eyes look beautiful and the detail is very impressive. Sound mixing could be better, probably the weakest department and I‚Äôm a little disappointed. Overall better than I could have hoped for. 

Again, the OP is fucking incredible. I have yet to listen to the ED though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Demetriade,"a friend asked me about the mysterious man with the newspaper, asking if it's kruger.. them innocent souls ! Anime onlies, you are for a show! just you wait for Ereh reveal!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EternalWisdomSleeps,"Loved it. It really feels that team's experience on Dorohedoro payed off. Titans looked a not-so-good in some movement, but well...they are lighter than they seem and judging by Dorohedoro they'll improve over time. It was a good decision to have cgi titans all the time as it'll mean consistent quality. Trailer track felt overplayed, but synchronisation of music and movement was perfect in some moments. Trippy op is a blessing and I sense manga spoilers there. Voice acting - just as I wanted. Though I'm missing wit eyes and background artist.

P.S. I'm biased as I hated some parts of the 1st season and this feels closer to my view of the manga."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheSilverSeraphim,"Fuck that was a fantastic episode yo. Loved the new scene with Jean, hope they add in more teasers for the post-timeskip 104."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinkdaisiesss,Lol I just realised Jean probs can't read Marleyan script/text (unless he learnt during the timeskip) so he must have been bringing the newspaper back for the volunteers to translate.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rafavinni,My god I had forgot how much of an asshole Magath was in the beginning
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShingekiNoEren,"When Falco commented about flying around with a sword, was that in the manga? I don't remember it. Could he be remembering Freckled Ymir's memories, even though he doesn't have the Jaw Titan yet?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ProfOfTheSnarkArts,Everyone's going on about the Jean cameo when my son Falco is having PATHS dreams of being in the survey corps.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OrangeRussianNPC,"I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt it coming, but it‚Äôs funny how Colt is pronounced Coruto. Like Boruto is named ‚ÄúBolt‚Äù after Neji."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Truthgamer2,This is 5th on r/all currently
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rainytsu,"I don‚Äôt know why people are being so negative about the cgi, I thought it was good/decent.

The cgi for the armor titan is great but kinda meh for the beast titan, still no reason to be so pessimistic about season 4."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fabiocean,"Small detail I noticed; the warriors seem to have red armbands, while warrior cadets have yellow ones and everyone else has grey ones. I don't think the manga did something like this, it adds a small amount of subtle world building, which I enjoy very much."
Fabiocean,ragnaroksoon,"it's the same thing in the manga, you can see it in the covers"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,reddadz,"Despite the CGI being blatantly obvious in a lot of shots, the movement seemed pretty good (especially with Jaws & Cart). Armored looked good in most shots but had 1 or 2 hiccups. Beast for me was the weakest, both in looks and movement.

Gabi stole the entire episode. While I'm still indifferent to her in the manga, I could see the anime making me like her more. Didn't expect the Jean (could be Willy?) cameo at the end so it looks like we're getting some anime-original scenes in Marley; can't wait to see what else they have in store.

The OP was.....meh. I see what they were going for with the abstract war motif but I was pretty underwhelmed. ED was pretty good, on the other hand. The focus on Falco & Ymir makes me anxious to see what'll happen in the final chapters.

Overall, I'd say this was a good premiere (8/10). People on both sides of the WIT/MAPPA divide will find reasons to like this episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jaka45,"Tbh the CG for Jaw Titan is really great, the way jaw move and jump is so smooth.

I definitely can see a potential with CG"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rokrbolt,Those added scenes of them charging then getting mowed down is crazy but I think it was a good add.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gamesus10,Crunchyroll crashed bruh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Progress-1212,"After watching this episode and seeing how amazing the production was I am so so so so fucking excited to see Eren‚Äôs first transformation in the basement with Reiner and ‚ÄúI just keep moving forward, until my enemies are destroyed‚Äù

It‚Äôs seriously going to send shockwaves throughout the anime community."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Beans_37,Ain‚Äôt seen anybody mention this but I AINT SEE REALLY ANY CENSORING
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinkdaisiesss,"The part with the humans-turned-titans being taken out of the blimp to be released was so good, the way their bodies were limp and dragged along the floor made the entire scene even more disturbing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,QuantumFraijol,"What if Falco ""memories"" about flying above the clouds are, after all, eren memories flying above the clouds? I'm saying this after falco's strange quote"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hudsolo2,"Loved it. Great episode, great animation (CG could do with some work) but overall great, intro was really good i think it fits the tone of the season quite well, and the new additions like Jean at the end were awesome. Also keeping with past seasons like the episode number and title, additional info cards, and armin narrating made it feel cohesive to the other seasons. Im excited for episode 2!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,I'm a bit bummed we didn't get to see that amazing shot of Reiner protecting Zeke from the PV. I guess they thought it'd be weird to put in a 2D shot considering most of the other have been 3D.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xemns4,Can't believe he managed to add spoilers for even the manga readers in the first ep. Im not even mad that's incredible
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,spectralpresence,"Honestly I really like the OP on its own but it doesn't feel very AOT? My only other manga reader friend said she didn't like it F

ED is literal perfection tho"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,N1COLAS13,I like WIT's titans more but imo Mappa does everything else better

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TP53_is_overrated,"Pacing was great, direction was amazing and CGI, well, it's still CGI, but It's way better than WIT's. To be honest, I had low expectations but MAPPA delivered!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DialedWrongNumber,I am really happy they have things in the episode that are surprising to manga readers as well. The original scenes and teasers have me going WTF.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rowanrawr,CGI Leiner waving deadass had me in tears üò≠
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,birdynamnam115,"Really liked the anime original scenes they added, like Reiner using the train as a shield. CGI titans look fine, but something is weird with the jaw titans model and I can't quite figure out what it is. Maybe his forehead is really big?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlaineCountiesMostWa,The opening is pretty good. It's the kind that'll grow on all of us after a couple more sessions
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lol_hey_its_me,Didn‚Äôt like the opening
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BabycakesJunior,"I don't know if this season would be possible with hand drawn animation. Decent but consistent CGI is probably the only way MAPPA will make it through all the shifter fights to come.

Personally, I'm fine with that. The beast titan was a little weird looking, but other than that, it was very good."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DeNooYah,"LIVE ON HULU, 3:45 PM EST PREMIERE"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,smegma_toast,Goddammit you guys broke Crunchyroll lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wingleesharm,Falco really has one of the survey corps memories...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,residentinhell,ive literally dreamed about the fort slava battle being animated for years holy fuck I'm still shaking that was so perfect--how the chaos was portrayed and you're just thrust right into the confusion of the battle and holy shit that opening is so perfect and creepy and oh my goooooodd
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fullmetal-ghoul,"That was amazing, I've only been caught up to the manga for about a year but it was surreal to see Marley get animated, I can't imagine how long time readers must be feeling like. It's gonna be so nice and helpful to have this to look forward to every week. I'm glad the pacing seems like it will be OK, and hopefully they can maintain this level of production quality throughout"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,potter0214,NGL watching everyone say how much they love Gabi is really funny given what‚Äôs gonna happen. But then there‚Äôs the redemption ‚Äúarc‚Äù after as well lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ZaiReq,When the trailer OST started playing goddamn. That made me hard
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Killcode2,"What happened? I come here and I see people bitching about how Mappa's downfall had happened and the anime is ruined. I watch the episode, am impressed at how good it is, come back here an hour later, and now all the comments are celebrating the episode. Was there a failed coup against Mappa?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,"Lyrics from the opening:
""Destruction and regeneration. You are the real enemy"".

Makes me think the ending will consist of a full-human extermination and allowing for the world to regenerate over many centuries."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AvalancheZ250,"Who was the narrator? Was it Armin's VA? It didn't quite sound like pre-timeskip Armin, which was to be expected."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,"Indulge my fanboyism for a bit, but I legit think chapter 121 is gonna make everyone say ‚Äúgalaxy brain Isayama‚Äù out loud. It is peak fiction.

Also, the Zeke-Eren dynamic is one of the best in AoT."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,matheusu2,Some people are complaining about the animation but  for me this episode was the most exciting first episode of any season
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlueExorzist,"I kinda get the people who don't like the start of the final season at all with the new art style, music etc. Because a. We literally are on the other side of the ocean and b. The character we already know from the previous seasons also changed in their personalities. This will be a very harsh and 'depressing' season with all this war and racial/political/mental conflicts. So imo the art style and the music capture these themes pretty well."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaximusPrime987,"Few of the CGI scenes looked a bit iffy, but the models themselves are great. Its an adjustment for sure but the opening, the voices, the ending, pretty much everything was amazing. The extra scenes detailing the fear of the Eldian soldiers was a nice touch"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AvalancheZ250,"Ok, Falco saying he felt as if he was flying around Titans and slashing them with swords is ***not what I expected.*** We did get a memory shard in one of Eren's memory outburst panels showing Falco in that exact scene, but we never got Falco's thoughts on the matter. This could just be an anime-only thing that has no bearing on future events, or it could be a real manga spoiler (for currently unknown future manga events) in the anime.

As for the episode itself, it felt... good. It definitely felt like AoT, except a few weird parts (music was uncanny in certain scenes, I'm undecided on the OP and ED). But otherwise, its at the standard we expect from an AoT anime. Well done MAPPA.

Gabi though... man, I actually forgot how manipulative she could be if she's determined. She played on Magath's own hesistation and relutance, netting herself a chance to shine. People with such fierce resolve are always finding new ways to worry you with the lengths they would go to for whatever it is they want... her title of ""female Eren"" is well-deserved. Of course, all this happened in the manga but it was one of the smaller scenes that I had forgotten about."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cookiboos,"CGI in season 3 was rough ngl but didn't bother me and if it looks better here which i know it is after seeing Dorehedero then all the better!

People should wake up to reality and realise that animating titans in 2D is quite impossible for any studio for the whole of 90-135 chapters."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Lol what are we even discussing at this point üòÇ we know everything already.
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Dinoswarleaf,what if eren is the armored titan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tehsigzorz,Anyone else wake up before their alarm due to the sheer hype?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nekomaro,"Furthermore, I have several points to make

1. The OP's blend of the eerie music with the colorful black white/rainbow contrast of war really highlights the theme of moral ambiguity
2. The use of CGI is very good compared to WIT and I can get by with this compromise
3. Really enjoyed how MAPPA continued using the original OST and the original title card/ad break info card - highlights how they're trying to keep the show consistent
4. Overall a very well animated episode - and I am incredibly grateful for MAPPA's work. Feels like a dream come true indeed."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lasernatoo,"I like the opening way more than I thought I would. Usually it takes me listening to it at least a few times for me to get a feel for it, but I've only heard it once and I really like it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turth3,In 1 year from now when everyone comes back and says they like this opening because they wanna be cool just like how everyone did with Red Swan. Remember this day.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Thedrogbinho,Is it Jean with the newspaper at the end? Interesting. It wasn't there in the manga.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ydoiexistlolidk,"lmao I think crunchyroll is down.

 

Edit: looks like funimation is down too..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Diet__Infinite,THEY‚ÄôRE STREAMING ON HULU!! THE FINAL SEASON IS STREAMING ON HULU!!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dogsgotocollege,WHAT DID FALCO MEAN ABOUT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WITH SWORDS AND TITANS!?!??!!?!??!!??!?!?!?!? like yes jaws titan but whose memories did he see??? is there more to it that we just havent found out in the manga yet??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hook25,"Really liked it. I think it looks good, cgi doesn't bother me at all."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pausei144,"It looks great overall

The CGI titans look good enough, with the exception of armored and monke, who are a bit awkward

The character designs and 2d animation is great

The directing is strong

Opening and Ending are amazing

If they keep up this level of quality, it's gonna be the best arc in the anime too"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bretrick01,"The cgi looked pretty good overall but it‚Äôs the frequency of its use that is worrying me, I much prefer Titans in the 2D form and the ratio of 2D to 3D Titan scenes is not much to my liking. Hopefully they put more into 2D Titans later on in the season or maybe I just need to get used to it..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MyNameIsElla,"I am loving the shit out of this already. The music is so good, and I love the new style of animation. I also really enjoyed all of the new voice actors so far. Can't wait to hear Pieck and Galliard next episode!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yobolay,"I actually liked what they did in this episode.

Here they actually struggled to get the job done with the guys with canons in the wall being more effective and the other armored train. Here it felt more balanced and you know, a war that has costed to finish and that highlights more how the titans are not that effective anymore. Not to talk about how they higlighted the hard time the soldiers, but in this case, the eldians have in the front.

Or at least that's the impression it gave me, in the manga felt more like a walk in the park for me although I may be imagining it.

On the other part the cg felt off some times (although that's a given) and not really a fan of the exagerated fat trashy captain, such a generic and under the nose design, the equivalent guy design in the manga was completely fine already."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mnabil01,"Damn that ED track was beautiful, maybe my favourite one so far in this series."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WeebScientist,Dude the cgi blended so well. I expected to be bad but I was wrong.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinkdaisiesss,"The only thing I will nitpick atm is probably the colouring. It looks like colour palettes for this season are more muted in comparison to the very vivid colours in WIT, almost as though there is a filter/some sort of softening effect in many of the shots. I don‚Äôt mind it, as it does look good. But it will take a little getting used to. I ended up increasing the brightness of my screen to compensate."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,evensnowdies,Falco's fingers looking weird in the first scene had me worried but I'm loving everything about this first episode. Feeling very positive about this season
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gshiinobi,"It was good.


Dunno how i feel about the CGI titans yet, on some parts it looked alright, but in others they looked very awkward, i can get used to it but i'll definitely be missing the old hand drawn titans from the first three seasons.


I also don't know how to feel about the OP yet, it's way more calming than expected despite the imagery (someone really needs to have an explosion counter for these episodes lmao), but i do appreciate all the nods to events that happen later in the manga (specially all those shots alluding to flying Falco)."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dtsdt,Is it possible that we may see young Eren and the rest of the 104th team in Reiner's memory next episode?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pulaobiryani,"When you look at the lyrics of the opening, it says at around 1 minute mark: ""children cling on to their very last coins"". Doesn't it seem like a reference to Remzi and Halil and their bag of stolen coins?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thecrustycrap,What are everyone's thoughts on Falco saying he flew around with swords? And him closing his eyes to the image Ymir and the paths tree for the ending? Is this some sort of foreshadowing?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,"Watching episode 1 with eng subs awakened something in me. Jesus Christ MAPPA...tbh be honest this is probably better than S3 WIT ever could have done it. I‚Äôm apologetically mistaken about the sound mixing (probably shouldn‚Äôt have called judgement having only viewed a crappy YT rip), it‚Äôs actually excellent. They did overuse the trailer soundtrack and I feel it was a little draggy. Still the standard AoT adrenaline pumper.

Enhanced the manga very well.

CG ain‚Äôt bad. Cart and Jaws look better with. Beast Titan has its faults and kinda lost its ‚Äúpunch‚Äù with the stark and arguably boring visual transition. Armored titan probably looks awkward in like two shots, otherwise spectacular job and decent movement. Sometimes CG can get ‚Äútoo fluid‚Äù in contrast to the outlaying 2D so glad I don‚Äôt feel that here.

Based MAPPA keeps Armin as the narrator and ‚ÄúTBC, # 61‚Äù end visuals and mid-break infographic. Continuity counts. I‚Äôm so happy.

Voice acting is stellar as always. Gabster is perfect."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ReadyForKenny,"They blended CGI and 2D very well, the soundtrack is peak too"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vihurah,"the opening is kinda fire too, no pun intended. 

the rythmn of the song is such a banger, that A b a b a b b b b c scheme, and the crescendo at the end with the zoom in on erens hardened titan. gives me chills."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ronwantread,The soundtrack is amazing... god blesss mappa
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,attack-the-storm,"i was very pleasantly surprised by the animation. my expectations were very low to keep myself from being disappointed, but i am pretty impressed. the CG looks spectacular, especially compared to witt studio. i can have high expectations again, especially for the rumbling."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HistoriaTheFirst,"I liked the opening?  The war propaganda is what we‚Äôve been predicting for years would be the Op of the marley arc. 

The only thing that annoyed me was the reuse of all the visuals; like the OP is one of the most watched things of an anime, so they really should‚Äôve put more characters in there, even the warriors, as opposed to the same shots of colorful clouds."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LankySeat,It's fucking RAW!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tehsigzorz,"1st time listening to the ED: meh
2nd time: not bad
3rd time: HANEO KUWASU MOSUNU TO NO A IKAAAAAAAA"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bitcheslovedroids,"the only cg that bothered me was the the beast titan's pitching windup, otherwise the episode looked fantastic. Def gonna rewatch when subs are out. Also its a trip to finally see gabu animated."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,pinkdaisiesss,"Waiting for the English subs to watch the full episode but I watched the OP on Youtube. I  really liked it, its very ominous and quite fitting for Marley with the wartime propaganda theme."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,Falco sounds a lot more mature than I imagined.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Progress-1212,"This was fucking amazing.  I felt the same level of excitement watching this as I did reading these chapters in the manga for the first time.

Thank you, MAPPA.  You truly are fucking delivering and I love you for it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jazzlike-Business2,"It was good. It was really good, actually."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Plentiful_Miruko,"The CGI was the big thing I noticed this episode, sometimes it looked incredible and really blended seamlessly with the backgrounds, other times it looked janky and really stood out. It does allow for more dynamic fights more often, I think it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll have to get used to, could certainly grow on me. The directing was top notch and watching the eldians fall from the airship was an incredible and disturbing shot. 8/10 episode, really exited to see where they take it from here"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,penguins2946,"This episode was amazing, holy shit. If this is what Mappa does to the manga for every episode, this is going to be incredible. 

I've had the stance that the manga peaked between the Liberio attack and Eren and Zeke in PATHS, and I'm so excited to see what Mappa can do with those episodes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aesion,"MAPPA slapped on this one, I can finally find peace knowing they are doing a good job"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rubbie,"I thought this was much better than expected and a great war episode overall

The CGI for the Armored and Beast Titans do stick out like a sore thumb and the final fight looked too video gamey for me but the rest was quite brilliant imo

(also made me love Gabi as a character all over again !)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KurlyKayla,"Does anyone else remember Falco saying he dreamt of flying around, fighting Titans? I don't remember that in the manga. 

Overall, I feel at ease. Obviously, there are changes to the animation style, but it doesn't look bad. Not super excited about the CGI, but again, it doesn't look bad.  Marley Arc is not my favorite, so I'm waiting to get to the more interesting bits, namely Liberio, but for now, I'm excited!

Also, Reiner....Reiner is looking like a snacc, I gotta say."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Martin7431,im ngl i thought most of the OP was in japanese but it's the only OP so far entirely in English. bye bye German
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fiaru-co,After reading the latest chapter now i recognise why falco always with bird flying scene even in ending song..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RipjawGaming,Wow so the stuff they showed in the trailer was early early developmental stage of animating
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,few shots of cgi titans don't look so good but the rest is great to me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vihurah,"i was praying there wouldnt be Cgi, even though deep down i knew there would be. but to be honest...

im absolutely fine with it. Mappas Cgi feels so different than the clunkier cgi that WIT used, something i especially felt during the armored titans sweep of the wall. its not perfect, but its certainly good."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rowanrawr,Gabi gang can‚Äôt stop winning (((o(*Ôæü‚ñΩÔæü*)o)))
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,weebtrash100,"I watched the first episode yesterday and it was amazing, I‚Äôm still reading the manga but holy shit the op, the action, the build was just great. I didn‚Äôt mind the CGI because it was better than a lot of other shows and it was barely noticeable at times"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Fuiger,"Jesus christ twitter is such a shithole. The sakuga ""community"" thinks they know everything about the production and are finding ways to nitpick every single aspect of the episode and saying it will go downhill from here lol. I get it, you're interested in anime and how it's made, but you still don't know shit."
Fuiger,jung2019,It's not any better here.
jung2019,Fuiger,At least not everyone here is a self-proclaimed anime expert that makes up their own story about the production just to find a reason to shit on it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Baby-Worm,"You bet your ass I installed the opening, its an amazing song that reminds me of WWI and WWII war chants, perfectly fitting with the dark tone Mappa went with!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jishwaaa,"Falco dreaming he was a paradis soldier wasn't mentioned in the manga, so the fact it's here means that is has a big role to play at some point in the future"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SourWatermoronCandii,I LOVED IT SO MUCH?? THEY LOOK GREAT IM ENJOYING LIFE RN. if i had to say smth bad tho i feel like it lacked music when the 800-men soldiers attacked
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LyannaEugen,"People thinking that the person in the end might by Willy Tybur:

1. Willy Tybur's hair is blonde.
2. Do you think the head of the royal family would be roaming so freely and buying a newspaper?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JenstenRazer,Wasn‚Äôt expecting Jean at all! Awesome stuff! It was a very enjoyable episode and I feel that we can say that we‚Äôre in safe hands with Mappa.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nekomaro,"That was an original scene of Jean, pretty unexpected"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zoufantastical,The ending was a nice twist. I'm sure anime onlies are losing their minds.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chillininthebasement,That ekhm before Zeke screamed was so cute. I love him so much üò≠ at least we'll see him in anime.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LazloFF,"The opening is so fucking weird but they will probably add shit to the visuals with time, GoT style.
But even with how is now, it's a good op."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"I like the opening fine, a bit on the meh side for me but not bad. I don't understand why is it inciting strong reactions lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Psychological_Pop_60,"Jean buying the newspaper and going out on the streets of Marley to the music ... seriously, what a beautiful thing. He is so perfect."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nowveidn,They didnt lie when they said the op would be full of explosions
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Animewe3b,"I just watched it and tbh i liked it, it was well done but I still need some time to get used to the new art and about the cgi it was great (can't say the same for monke tho it still needs improvements)but at some parts it was odd looking. But y'all I already miss the fucking 104th even tho I just red the manga"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,blehbleh2332,Animation is a bit weaker than previous seasons of WIT but its still early and im still hyped af lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oh-lawd-hes-coming,Who‚Äôs ready to _CUM_?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"did Reiner really slapped the walls in the manga? I don't remember it, I always thought that it was just his...fall"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Amature_Specialist,Now on Hulu. MST here
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raknel,"Surpassed every expectation. One thing that especially stood out to me was the music.

My big criticism of WIT is that they didn't use enough music eventhough the OSTs are amazing. MAPPA crammed it full and it really elevated the tension."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,009reloaded,"Wow, imagine if we keep adapting at this pace. Did this episode cut out a single moment from chapters 91/92?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wrecked_reject,"CHILLS. Love the voice acting, the directing, the op and ed, everything. Zeke's scream was one of the best moments of the episode for me, also Reiner's commentary before transforming into the armored titan. The cgi for Reiner and Zeke was definitely a bit awkward, but I didn't hate it. Can't wait for the upcoming episodes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,taiga27,"Ok, I just watched it subbed. I'm amazed. Everything about this was amazing. The animation, the music, the opening, the adaptation of manga content to animation.. It was worth waiting through all these months of doomposting about the production and anxiety. If they keep the quality of this first episode through the entire season, we're in for a nice ride, boys!!!

On a side note, I found the description of Falco's dream quite weird. ""Flying around with swords and going at the titans""?  This line isn't in the manga, is it? P A T H S intensifies? lmao.

Anyway, I'm happy. It exceeded all my expectations."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,readwriteread,"I feel like if they had just shown Gabi looking at all those depressed ass soldiers anime-onlies would be completely sold on her, but as it stands I can't tell if she's more sympathetic than she was at this point in the manga."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mellowbigfoot,"After rewatching it the second time, I can say im extremely hyped and actually like the CG."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,12345pickle,Snape kills Dumbledore
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WoodOnChain,I actually really like the opening. It's very unique and it fits the theme that the season is gonna have.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IWearPinkPants,Is Armin still narrating the story? I honestly don't recognize the voice
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lord_mush,Did falco just spoil the last fight? He doesnt say that in the manga right?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yobolay,"Lol at those lyrics in that chorus in the op

""Angels playing disguised, with devil's faces. Children cling to their coins, squeezing out their wisdom""

Absolutely macabre, it's talking about Eren and Ramzi/Halil deaths isn't it?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Klumzzy,"Although the titans were CG a couple of times, you can tell they tried to blend them in with a hand-drawn style rather than being an obvious 3D render. This was a great start, and I can't fucking wait to hear more of the OST <33333"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bobathanhigs,Love the new VAs. I hope they‚Äôre using CG now so the big moments can be 2D though
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Remarkable-Mousse-96,"I loved it , i have no idea about cgi so i cant criticize, wit studio animation is superior but i love mappas style. But they used the trailer music a little too much hope its just a first ep thing . And loved the jean cameo."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Erens_Abs,"The atmosphere was like an anime version of dunkirk/another war movie. You could feel the fear. From the man shouting Colts name only to die right after, to the Eldian suicide squad shivering in fear, Mappa did a great job. 

Anti-titan machinery aside, we once again saw how scary the titans are against humans when it's 1v1. Along with the 4 kids watching, and the Marleyan guy blaming them, we've got a really harsh start. 

I wish there was somehow a bit more emphasis on Zeke claiming war is terrible. But overall, it was a great episode. Thank you Mappa"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Snaxia,Does anyone have theories on what the rain means in the opening?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NadeshikoAVlat,Something that annoyed me a little is that they overused the the trailer ost a bit. Just a small nitpick.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,watglaf,"It‚Äôs started, the beginning of the end.

I suppose you could say it can‚Äôt be stopped anymore."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,k1213693,Idk about y‚Äôall I really liked the opening. Probably my 4th favorite in AOT but that‚Äôs just bc the others are amazing too. The CGI looks alright too.
k1213693,sharethebear1,"The OP is perfectly fitting for the timeskip, in my opinion."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jarrnn,"Turned out my trust in Mappa was justified!

OP fitting perfectly, dig the ED too.

CG didn't bother me at all, maybe 1-2 exceptions but it's ight.

Character designs very good

Choice of soundtrack EPICC

Let's fucking go Mappa, let's keep that quality :)

Overall 8/10, gotta keep the higher numbers for future episodes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deputy141,"1.Pacing-As it expected they wont rush it good old 2 chapters/episode so 16 episodes will mean end of ymir story or eren's declaration.Definately a second part will arrive in 2022 or end of 2021 as still 4-5 chapter might be left and till the anime will air for 4 months.

2.Animation:I like it.Everyone can nitpick all they want but i had no problems.I think we cannot judge cg and animation quality till we get to the first battle [arc.So](https://arc.So) just stop complaining.The people at MAPPA had put a lot in it.

3.Opening:Spoilerless as i wanted it.Would like to see how they will change it later.

I still dont know why they put that initial part of Falco saying about flying and killing titans with swords.Was it just a joke?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,aidree1,Is it just me or Magath sounds like Keith and it‚Äôs no coincidence lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Xen58,"This opening is so good imo, Sasageyo was previously my favourite but I think this is tied with it for me now. The visuals, though, are a little disappointing on the op. I like the general visual style, but every shot is reused a bunch of times. That shot of the soldiers marching though... reminds me of something that'll happen later :D"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShirazumiLio,CRAYOOOOLLLLLAAAAA

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,slyderka,Do you actually think anime onlies are going to be able to recognize that's Jean? I don't think so

Also, I really like all the new voice actors, espacially Gabis"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tctony,"Damn why was I rooting for Reiner 

That was nuts! Well done. What an opener

CGI is better, but still noticeable. No real complaints. Some weird things added. Falco having a dream about swords and titans? Jean reading the paper at the end?

Opening and ending kinda go!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,definedevine,"Exceeded expectations, was horrified by the creepiness of the opening the and beauty of the ending, and pleased with the balanced use of CG. I am so fucking HYPED for the rest."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"anyone else here believes that each one of the nine titans represents something that Ymir felt?

attack titan is obviously the desire for freedom.

jaw titan is sacrifice for others.

Jaw- Sacrifice 

Armored- Defense

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RezzXIII,New OP has been stuck in my head all day plz help
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OverLorD83n,The CGI armour titan looks pretty badass. Well executed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jin030119,"Ngl, the trailer had me hyped to see the Jaws, Cart and a lil bit of Reiner‚Äôs titan hand drawn. But most of that is instead changed to CGI. Pretty disappointed. But don‚Äôt get me wrong. The CGI is way better than WIT. Being spoiled with hand drawn titan fights for 3 seasons doesn‚Äôt help either xD. 

Here‚Äôs hoping when more major fights come, ie Paradis vs Marley, the titans will be 2D."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShingekiNoEren,"I feel like the anime-onlies' reaction to Eren slaughtering civilians at the festival isn't going to be as drastic or controversial as when it happened in the manga.

Remember how that was a super huge and controversial thing between manga readers? One side immediately branded Eren as an evil monster, the other side still believed that what Eren was doing was justified/for the greater good, and some people were pretty much neutral.

I'm a Jaegerist myself and I hope at the end of the manga, Eren wins. But I still remember being a bit shocked when Eren started killing civilians at the festival.

I think this was because of the month-long wait between chapters, which kinda artificially made us think we were more attached to these characters than we should be. It took 10 months from us first being introduced to the Marleyan POV to see Marleyan and other civilians getting slaughtered by Eren. In that time frame, we had a lot of time to make fanart, theories, analyses, re-read the chapters, and just in general sympathize with and appreciate the Marleyan side of things. That's why, when Eren came swinging, it caused such a schism in the fanbase.

But...it's not gonna take 10 months from this episode to reach the Battle of Liberio. A single anime episode almost always condenses multiple manga chapters inside of it. And we're not getting one episode a month, but one a week. It's gonna be a lot shorter of a wait, which gives the anime-onlies less time to become attached to the new characters.

On another note, where do you guys think that this 16-episode season will leave us? I know that they showed Eren and Reiner's final battle in Shiganshina in the trailer, but can they actually get all the way there in 16 episodes?"
ShingekiNoEren,PICKLEguy44,"Realistically I'm thinking the season's gonna end right at the start of the rumbling..or Eren getting his head blown off - you know, just for the cliffhanger"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noorodah,"SO The episode covers exactly 2 chapters, that means episode 5 is gonna be declaration of war BABE and it's gonna leace with a cliffhanger ;)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Stick124,"Seems like theyre primarily using CGI for the main 9 Titans.  
I don't mind, it actually looks pretty cool."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Titangamer101,"Wow just fucking wow honestly that episode on its own is already a top 5 for me, despite it not being wit the animation was still amazing in its own way bravo mappa (let's hope they can keep up this quality at the very least for the major fights).

I would even say that if it were mappa that started AoT from season 1 instead of wit I would be satisfied (Not trying to debunk wit they did an amazing job as well).

I love the additional scenes they added as well with soldiers being gunned down and blown up to the extended battle of the armoured titan.

The opening again it's not wit but I do like it in its own way but it is very different but still good, also the end of the opening has erens attack titan on top of a bunch of other unique looking titans is that foreshading the current events of the manga I wonder?

The biggest thing for this episode and most likely the rest if the season is again yes it's very different compared to wit and the previous 3 seasons but and I big BUT it's completely ok being different because in its own way it's still fucking amazing.

Bravo mappa bravo I look forward to the rest of the season."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vishwas_gajawada,Honestly... I like the cg titans too.... Feels like aot officially became seinen
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Coolade123456,"I thought the episode was amazing. The music, action, and storytelling was too tier.  The scene where Reiner says he's sick of walls gave me a good chuckle.  One thing I'm not a fan of is the new animation.  I don't mind how the people and environments look, but I think that the Titans don't look good in their new CGI models.  Despite this, still a great episode.  I'm looking forward to watching the next episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MysticJohn,"Look, I think we all knew that the CGI was inevitabe, and it wasn't bad or anything ...But still I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that there weren't more hand drawn sequences."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisuthepretty,And gabi was fucking CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEE like super cute. Her voice was so mature. Omfg. I loved the Gabi x Falco scenes. They were everything. His little blush towards her omg üò¢üò¢üíúüíú they are precious.
Hisuthepretty,ragnaroksoon,"this sub will burn again when Sasha got wrecked, I bet that the gabi bot will come back"
ragnaroksoon,5437354724,"I thought we were past hating Gabi. Instead, titanfolk seems interested in seeing anime-onlies‚Äô reaction."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SqurtieMan,I will pray every night that we don't get CGI war hammer
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShingekiNoEren,"Usually I can handle people having different opinions than mine. But...

The people who are saying that the OP is bad...are actually insane.

Yeah, the first 40 seconds isn't really anything special, but that moment where it shows the soldiers marching along with the chanting in the background is fucking beautiful. From that moment onward, the OP is amazing."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HistoriaTheFirst,"I have posted nothing but dozens of positive comments all day about the episode, including the content and the OP and ED both of which I absolutely adore. 

I think you guys watch a lot more anime than me. The CGI didn‚Äôt bother me at all. There were only a few scenes where I could tell it was CGI. I‚Äôm truly not seeing how Zeke looks worse than the others and I‚Äôm really trying to (but like I said, this sounds like a me problem).  So my following criticisms have nothing to do with the CGI. 

Here is some criticism:

-MAPPA‚Äôs eyes aren‚Äôt the same as WIT‚Äôs. That might sound minor, but WIT brought about so much emotion in characters‚Äô expressions with their eyes and that first scene of Falco waking up showed just how lacking MAPPA is in this department. 

-The color palette was overall dull. It was as if a fade filter had been placed over every single scene and it‚Äôs just not as visually appealing 

-I didn‚Äôt mind the CGI but the blur was real. There were several times I had to pause and rewind because I thought my connection was bad because my screen seemed blurry all of a sudden, but nope, that was the actual episode 

-The lack of a score in certain scenes really stood out

-I love the OP, don‚Äôt get me wrong. The scenes we do have that have actual content are exactly what I wanted for this arc, and those scenes alone were done so well that it made the OP one of my favorites of all time.  Those scenes are perfect. But there were several scenes of just colorful clouds, not even explosions. I hope that they‚Äôre going to add to the OP as the season goes, but if they don‚Äôt do that, I am really questioning the decision to include several seconds of literal clouds with nothing else in an OP of such a popular series. 

-Adding to that, while the ED is beautiful, it also has scenes of just sparks flying around for several seconds. 

-I watched the live stream this morning and I‚Äôve seen the Hulu official sub as well as clips of the fanmade subs. Gabi‚Äôs hair has a distinct purple hue. While that may sound super nitpicky, in a series where characters are made to look realistic, I really must wonder why MAPPA chose to go with such an unnatural hair color for her. It‚Äôs definitely not black or dark red; it‚Äôs purple. 

Most of my critiques are really minor things because I honestly believe MAPPA did a great job overall. I can‚Äôt count how many times I got emotional over this episode today that was based on a chapter I didn‚Äôt particularly feel much for in the manga. Good on MAPPA. I look forward to their next episodes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Swift311,"I guess that next 3-4 chapters are going to be kinda boring unless MAPPA will add some additional details that differs from manga. Really hyped for declaration of war episode, I hope they won't make it a cliffhanger"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AxMeAQuestion,"Liked the episode, but I'm really not a fan of the shifter CG. It's definitely better than Wit's Colossal Titan in S2/S3, but it's still not great looking. It was especially bad in the slow motion scenes. Also don't get why they animated Pure Titans normally and just did CG for the shifters."
AxMeAQuestion,eraser_stp,"Because pure titans is more unique, but their screentime is shorter. It's easier to draw a short scene than to invest in the 3D model, which will then have to be remade for an every new titan or not used at all."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"if Falco dreamed about being a paradis soldier, does that means that...he will eat Eren?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kk_victory,"Idk why but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone mentioning Falco‚Äôs line in the beginning about how he was zooming around titans with a sword?? That wasn‚Äôt in the manga right? What was that about??

Fantastic episode btw, in every aspect. I am beyond hyped."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NetNat,"I didn't notice anyone mentioning Falco's quote when he woke up, about how he was just flying around with swords. Don't think that was in the manga, it's an interesting addition... perhaps it means he gets the Founding Titan and the ability to see the past lives of another founding titan who witnessed the Eldians fighting??"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,humanityyy,"I'm not sure why a lot were shitting on Mappa's CGI titans. It honestly looks really good to me. Better than WIT's, definitely.

Animation and visuals are looking really well! It's not too jarring of a change. I'm really excited for how they'll be adapting this. The anime-only lines were pretty sweet, too."
humanityyy,CentJr,"Probably because nobody is used to it yet (although imo it could use a little bit of shadows)


I mean can you blame them? They spent 3 seasons watching 2d titans."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Canigetsomebis,What a great art style
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jarrnn,"when i go to that site it literally just says

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spaghestis,Bruh Im just sitting here watching a 10 minute ad for a japanese medieval soap lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,ok the amount of bullwts gabi dodged animated is actually ridiculous lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,megann243,Damn both op and ed are so abstract. Falco getting that shine in the ed tho :o
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vasllui,My worries are nothing: THIS EPISODE WAS AMAZING!!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tbomb200,"I don't like how they animate the titan fall scene, but Reiner fight scene was awesome. didn't notice in the manga that Reiner lost his arm to those armored trains"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bonzy-buddy,WHERE CAN I WATCH THE RAWWWWWW
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,battyman17,the episode was amazing. I am now convinced that Mappa will nail the action sequences in future episodes. the slow motion in certain action scenes were a great touch. Also I personally liked the opening and ending theme very much. It is good for the anime onlies.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,The-Big-Mara,The OP was hella weird but the last part where the Attack Titan was shown lowkey looks like a devil
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Freieguy,Tomorrow will be fun seeing the none manga readers reactions.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,katiefr,"The ending was soooo good dude... My heart was all over the place from goosebumps. The music was so beautiful, definitely will add it on my playlist"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GioMike,"Don‚Äôt know why, but the opening soundtrack is stuck in my head on a loop ."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,technobleed,The ending credits had the P A T H S Tree...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Galactos1,Where can i watch it with subs on a pirated site?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Baby-Worm,"Everyone is talking about the opening, but the ending was also amazing! Lots of bird titan imagery! And also nothing to spoil for the anime onlys!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AndreV3O,I would like to point out for the people who didn‚Äôt know that MAPPA wasn‚Äôt the one who did the CGI. It was outsourced to another studio called V-Sign and not done in house by MAPPA.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,allpaccaa,Will Chrunchyroll really release the new ep in like 2 minutes?? Im scared and nervous
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Covert_Ruffian,Can anyone see the new season on Hulu? I'm looking at the drop-down menu on the AOT page and I don't see Season 4.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,shoaib_32123,Where can i watch for free
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sonstribido,"So, for everyone with the crunchyroll crash issue. (On mobile) I went to -My Lists ,-Attack on titan, -episodes and in the season list you'll see the new season with the episode. At least that worked for me"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dhtikna,Maybe falco is some how seeing Ymir's memories via jaws titan from the future because of some interaction he would with have with Eren in the coming chapters?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnitaMiniyo,I completely loved it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pastequette,"I really don't understand all the comments about the CGI looking like shit, even comparing it to berserk (that's harsh boys). I think the animation looked smooth, I couldn't even tell when they used CGI compared to the past seasons with colossal titan looking ... terrible. I think the titan animations fit in the animation."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nonlinearhate,what‚Äôs up with falco‚Äôs dream?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sou_pay,"I expected the cgi to be better based on how somewhat hyped up it was, comparitively its WAY better than wits(or a vast majority out there). When it becomes nighttime during the Marley attack I expect the cgi to look really good as the flaws blend into the darker backgrounds and lighting. Still good though.

The 2d animation was also pretty good, even if it was somewhat stiff at some parts. But my god, do I think the detailing of the background and just overall look of the designs of the characters is just top notch. The new atmosphere you get from how it looks might take sometime to get used to but I honestly think it's just amazing overall.

Very hype for the eventual sakuga with this new look!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AvatarRohan2025,Did anyone else think that what Falco said was weird? It sounded like he attained the memories of a past shifter similar to episode 1 with Eren or could be a reference to his bird form?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turth3,Is Falco gonna become the Attack Titan?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FiddledSnake,"Falco's dream was cool touch, considering he inherits the Jaw and Ymir was a scout"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shigashiganshina,The war has begun! Oh never mind is already finished in the first episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,masterflaccid,"honestly surprised by the cgi. in some parts it's REALLY good, but not so much in others. it seems like it's best suited for reiner and gallard since reiner has a mostly solid surface and gallard's face doesn't move. i say this because the only titan that's completely organic is monke and he kinda sticks out. i'm still a bit worried that more scenes from the trailer will be cut like the part with the warhammer in place of more cg shots. can't complaint too hard though. it can always be worse. it can always be like the live action movie."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JacksLantern,"I'm surprised people were bothered by the CG, even knowing they were CG Galliard and Reiner I thought looked /fit in great."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,A_Very_Horny_Zed,"Reiner kicking ass and taking hits will never get old. Reminds me of John Wick how he's still a total badass even with getting hit a few times, it's very realistic."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cucumberdesu,MAPPA is killing it! The animation is so good and I love the extra scenes they added. CGI was great too but it‚Äôll take a bit of time to get used to.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KyloTennant,"The CGI was actually pretty good in this one. And the episode as a whole was sure cool and epic to see animated, I'm really excited to now to see the rest of the battles of season 4!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raphthegraph69,The ED is so beautiful. I honestly like it over the OP but the OP is still great.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YYHH119,"the op entrance is not the best, it could be done better, but the rest of the op is damn lit üî• the rest of the anime is very good, well done mappa"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dominator5609,"Holy fuck! Honestly that‚Äôs all I can say . This anime has so much love behind it, and quite literally every episode is the best, but god damn this first episode! This season can only get better."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,goneghosted-yt,"I think falcos sword comment was about ymir, because she had the jaw and she was also 'flying with swords, killing titans' and he inherits the jaw"
UnquestionablyNotNik,big_dik_donald,"Nah the cliff-hanger would be after he transforms and rips the floor apart. That would generate way more hype than ""I just keep moving forward"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kitzz11,"Disagree with people complaining with the CGI here, sure some scenes looked awkward but they dont destroy the enjoyment from the episode. The CGI is also not bad at all, it‚Äôs decent-good, they are not like berserk anime level CGI. Sure 2D titans are awesome but it‚Äôs nearly impossible to animate every titans manually especially with the latest chapters, this coming up from someone who studied animation. 

The pacing, which I feared the most before, in this episode turns out great, they even emphasize the eldians emotion when they got called out to be suicide bombers. The ED is great while the OP is alright for me."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,attackonkyojin3,Holy shit that was an incredible opening to this season. The CGI looks fucking amazing and the rest of the animation is great as well. I hope they keep this up the whole season.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StalinDNW,The end song is so sick I'm losing my shit in anticipation.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kurk021,"The cgi on the jaw,cart and armored titan was good but the beast tho......."
kurk021,general_accoubi,it was wanky but i'd say it's still better than the cgi colossal.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,-V0lD,"The op ain't bad. It isn't guren no yumiya or sasageyo, but it fits the season

What worries me is that they reused the same shot of that nuke like 4 times"
-V0lD,Vecus,could be that the plan to replace a lot of the shots later with more relevant stuff to the story to avoid spoiling
Vecus,-V0lD,I'd be all for that
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DK_1287YT,"I never noticed how they wore armbands before. Probably because I was scrambling to  catch up to the manga those 6 some months ago after watching seasons 1-3 but maan being able to see it animated it really does give off vibes of ww2. All the things I never noticed in the manga, like the way they  say devil, and are brainwashed into believing that. I also never thought about the fear that must be being a Titan sacrifice before. Mappa certainly got the discomfort of this arc down. It was so *unsettling* to watch those poor(certainly won‚Äôt be poor after potat is gone) kids be completely brainwashed and treated like that. Same with that look of dread the eldians had in the plane. Can‚Äôt fuckin wait for the rest of the season, bois."
DK_1287YT,artsylar,Grisha flashback already have armband on marley. You need to rewatch.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jwaters0122,times like this i wish i was an anime only. the epicness they are about to witness will be too much
jwaters0122,Titanguy101,Give up on your dream and finish the manga
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jung2019,"Ok, the direction of the episode was really cinematic and had minimal anime tropes. The absense of music like Midnight sun during crucial dialogue scenes was a great stylistic choice and set the seinen tone for the season .

I personally don't think Wit's shiny and colorful imagery would've done justice to this season's bleak outcome."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,rvtots33,"Is the CGI really that bad? I started liking it when Reiner joined the battle up to end, it gave me goosebumps and I think the BGM at that time carried it too."
rvtots33,weebtrash100,"I didn‚Äôt think it was bad, sure it was noticeable but that‚Äôs expected. I thought the first episode was awesome"
rvtots33,carm_ineREd,"The first time I watched it I really didn't like it, but after rewatching, I don't mind the CGI at all. It's definitely sorta weird at first, but all things considered, it's done well and I think everyone would be better off coming to terms with it rather than getting upset."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Edwin5302,"Ok 
1 The animation and the drawings were good
2 The CG titans... Idk, they weren't bad but I need to get used to it
3 The opening song is amazing, it's so eerie, but I'm not a fan of the metaphoric approach, and the ending is great
4 That Jean cameo at the end was awesome"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,unrelatedtoelephant,"It‚Äôs been forever since I read Chapter 90 and all that but since watching Evangelion this summer,  Gabi reminds me so much of Asuka. Just like the cockiness and everything. It‚Äôs funny, they even trained for the same thing... Asuka for the Eva‚Äôs and Gabi to get in the big flesh equivalent of a mecha robot lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YerBoyDers,"Loved the episode, always knew that. But does it seem like the MAPPA animation has a weird haze or blurry like quality to it?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,G5lite,"I was hoping to see more visuals in the opening but it's perfect to avoid spoilers. Any details they added would have revealed a lot. I liked the song. Same with the ending. I love that the episode gave me that feeling of when we started the Mare arc, a new series. And I liked the little changes and additions, like Magath and Colt in the store. I liked Jean's scene to give it context, but the chronology of Eren's escape from the infiltration confuses me.

I will have to get used to the character designs and the CGI of the titans, they are good only that it makes me weird. The voices are perfect as always. Now just wait for Eren probably in chapter 3 or 4"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,StalinDNW,This might be my favorite end theme in all of anime.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DemifiendCturne,"I'm starting to like the op song as I listen to it more, but the visuals kinda garbo"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,arnav1311,Haven't seen it yet but I hope the music is as good as season 1-3. Music is a big part of this anime for me.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gp_12345,"""How much explosion do you want?""

MAPPA: ""Yes"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turth3,"So I actually liked how the Armoured look in CG. You can tell that‚Äôs where most of their time went because his scenes looked pretty fluid and well integrated. Aside from the wave it was pretty good. Jaws and Cart also worked for me, I guess since they‚Äôre so small and quick they don‚Äôt stand out as much. 

But the Beast.... ugh was bad. His slow lumbering style did not translate to CG for me. It felt like he had no weight to him when he was falling or throwing. Compare that to the first time he shows up heavily trotting around, it has weight. Overall fine with it but I hope it gets a little better for the beast."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MMD_933_,Does anyone know what is said in the mid pause screen information where there's the Marleyan soldiers with the Titan shifters?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iamnotapancakee,Porcos Titan looks good in cgi! Mappa done a great job following the manga art but I kinda miss Wit Studio now lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,reicha7,"I thought it was really good. Took some getting used to the art style but the shifter titans look absolutely spectacular!

Really liked how they extended the fight with Reiner getting his ass handed to him (even if adding a second armoured train was a bit weird considering how important the first one was) but still proving how strong Titans were.

Liked the extra focus on the Eldian soldiers as they were being briefed for the suicide charge. The sheer horror on display and the nightmarish suicide vests (which is such a Marley thing to do) was a great flourish.

Gabi and Magath's VAs were absolutely phenomenal and really helped bring the chars to life.

Some of the really wide shots looked a bit janky at times. An example is when the titans are smashing into the ground and then just vanishing in a puff of smoke basically. 

I also always pictured Zeke's scream being a much more terrifying sound but maybe he'll do a better one in beast form.

I think in terms of pacing it was good to get both those chapters out the way in episode 1. I know people are concerned at a 2 per-episode pace but here it made sense as it was largely action and they still had to pad it out with extra shots to hit the runtime anyway. I imagine it will slow down again until episode 4 or so so we can get all the awesome world building and character interactions that made the Marley arc so great"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Martin7431,"in the opening where it's like ""CHILDREN CLING ONTO THEIR LAST COINS""

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,majesty-theancient,Link to sub episode please?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"I have watched the episode 3 times and I'm surprised at how hyped I am lol I didn't expect to love it this much.

I don't even specially like these chapters but seeing them animated is so gooooooood"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,brandonbsh,"As someone who hates CGI I felt like MAPPA did a great job making it look realistic as possible. Really good CGI that I‚Äôll have to get used to (although beast Titan did look a little weird). Style seems a bit different from WIT studio but I still really like this style. Gabi is fucking adorable idc what you guys say 

Overall 9/10 episode"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kiritobaum,"So, uh, I really liked it, the titans were well made, the op and ed are pretty good (I prefer the ed, but whatever), there are some bad drawings (my opinion, probably because I really liked wit studio drawings)"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WeebScientist,"Does falco has eren's memories? In the scene where falco was day dreaming, he said that ""wasn't I flying around with a sword just now?""

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JJPWORLD21,"How many chapters in the manga did this episode cover? Also, many people don't like the CG titans, but honestly I'm cool with it, the models aren't that bad..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MMD_933_,"I just want to cry guys

The animation

The fort that is a little city

The new scenes with the perspective of the Eldian soldiers

The scene when Koslow tell the soldiers to stand up

The ending scene with Jean among the Marleyans


I LOVE IT"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,R3pN1xC,"# THEY DIDN'T FUCK IT UP

I cried at the ending, we have been waiting 3 years to see this animated, it's beautiful. Both the OP and ED are good, the OP isn't at the levels of sasageyo but it's a solid 8/10, the ED IS A FUCKING BANGER, THE SCENE WITH YMIR AND THE PATH TREE WAS SO GOOD OMG."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoteurV4,Love the op tbh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,salmancharms,"The highlights of the episode:
-The OP with its unsettling nature; It was already expected it to be creepy from the same band who made the S2 ed. 

-The focus on deaths, dead bodies and atrocities of war; It really enhanced the theme of the Arc, like the soldiers watching from the heap of dead bodies, situation in trenches.

-The mindless Titans drop. That was just amazing! 

-The framrate and good CG; The fluidity of action scenes was amazing. The aerial shots, The armored train, Jaw Titan's scenes, Majority of Reiner's scenes were really good.

-Realistic colours and art; The detailing was really good. The scenes of Gabi destroying the train was too good. Although I liked the slightly saturated colours of WIT, I love the realistic colours too.

-The still scenes of bodies flying!

-The Eyes! Everyone was afraid of eyes not being to the level of WIT but MAPPA's eyes are amazing too.

-OUR BOI >!JEAN!<

-The soundtrack. It was good and immersive, especially after the mindless titan drop.

Minor things which I didn't like:
-The Jaw titans face; I loved how they animated him in the PV but downgraded him a little bit like the teeth, amount of hair,etc.

-Increased amount of CG on Reiner and Zeke; Reiner's CG while destroying the Fort looked really good but they should have kept it 2D in still scenes which made the CG prominent like Reiner signalling Zeke, Zeke destroying the ships. The shift from smooth action scenes to the jarring 12 fps hurt me.

-The ""Isn't war a terrible thing scene"". I had so much expectations for the scene from the small clip in PV, but they ruined it with CG Zeke. 

In my opinion, MAPPA is more or less saving it's budget for the *spoiler* >!The declaration of war and Liberio raid!< Which are much action packed and integral to the story.
Both the studios, WIT and MAPPA are amazing! As we have seen the news about the Production team's forceful calendar to release the season in less amount of time. So, we need to give MAPPA the benifit of the doubt!
Overall, I loved the episode! I liked the OP, which sets the mood for the arc. I'm excited for the future episodes! Let's see what's more to come.

P.S. I got to know from the comments that CGI wasn't done by MAPPA themselves, but was outsourced to another studio. I really hope the jarring CGI isn't repeated again! Or else the Production team and the outsourced studio will really harm S4."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,"Falco having future memories has to be significant right? Assuming the Alliance does win this may mean he inherits the Attack Titan for whatever reason.

But goddamn that was amazing. The pacing and voice acting are really my two big things. For the Marley arc especially I never expected visuals to surpass the manga, and I'm actually liking the CG titans so far because it's not like we see a whole lot of Titans, relatively, from this point on anyway. But God the pacing was so great, and every VA choice is on point. I also appreciate that they didn't change a lot of the sound design just for the sake of change, so little things like Reiner's footsteps or the sound of Titan Transformation are consistent with the previous seasons. ALSO ALSO the title card is back baybee"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zoufantastical,Guys is it possible that Falco somehow got Freckled Ymir's memory of being in the survey corps given how he eventually gains the jaws titan eventually? They're gonna have to expand on this.
zoufantastical,taiga27,"Falco dreaming of being in the survey corps was so weird, specially considering the line isn't in the manga. why they felt the need to add this? what's this even supposed to mean? lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"lol, lots of dudes spoiling people on youtube, so if you have some animeonly friends let them know about this and avoid snk content"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheDarkNerd10,Is the opening directed by Michael Bay or something?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DaBow,"Really enjoyed it. We are in good hands with MAPPA.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,suicidalcentipede8,"The CGI is definitely better but it‚Äôs still CGI man, I wish they would just hand draw it."
suicidalcentipede8,Fabulous_James,"yeah, cart and jaws looked good but I think Monke looks like a ps3 character"
Fabulous_James,suicidalcentipede8,"Reiner looked good in stills, but his movement were clunky, everything else looks good thought."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AnimalSloth,This episode was a good reminder of what kind of world Armin and the alliance are fighting to protect
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cidalkimos,Seeing the anime onlies saying Gabi is overconfident and gonna get bodied lol. They in for a rude awakening.
cidalkimos,depressome,"To be fair, her whole mentality and conception of the world *kind of does* ""get bodied"" (or at least rocked to its core) when she later visits Paradis."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lasernatoo,"Every addition/change MAPPA made in this ep was for the better, and the Titan shifters for the most part looked great, especially the Jaws and Cart."
Lasernatoo,Gensi_Alaria,"Dude legit, Cart looks better than it did last season. So much more girth and poise to the titan. I want to fuck it. I do. It looks that good. 

Same with Jaws"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MysticJohn,"People saying its gonna be 16 episodes and a movie. This episode covered chapters 91+92.

How on earth do you fit 43(this doesn't include the,at the very least,3 more chapters that are yet to release in the manga) in 16 episodes and a movie?

Even if you go at a 2 chapters pace for EVERY episode(which isn't gonna happen),you'll still have only covered 30 more chapters this season, leaving the movie to cover at least 16 more chapters.

That's impossible."
MysticJohn,noraeffingdurst,"If they could do 2 chapters in 30 minutes, they could do 8 chapters in two hours, which would mean two movies to finish it off. I COULD see it happening, but I think a full season is the more likely scenario"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Moody-jazz,"Could use some 2d animations in between but the lighting effect on the cg model (armored) really needs updating. Feels like too many unnecessary shaded bits on his armor when he's in the sun. Porco's mane was done dirty.): The actual fight scenes look sick though
I'm curious to see how they'll look like in liberio since it's much darker. But for titan brawls, the cg titans have got me a bit worried."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tastypesto,I can't remember when was the last time I feel so excited about something
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sawucomin18,CGI looked great.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAteTheCheezyNacho," My thoughts:

The OP:

Its  visually quite good but its a bit repetitive and lacks variety. I love  the smoke effects and the explosions look gorgeous. The rainbow colours  picked sort of remind me of the rainbows in OP 5 and I adore the airship  and the soldiers marching, they really fit the Marley aesthetic.  This  all comes together to make an idea of war being romanticised by Marley  but the reality is different as then comes the images of the Marley  soldiers, Survey Corp scouts and the airship being smashed to pieces  showing how war is horrible and affects all.

Then  we get a liquid falling into a puddle and someone holding out their  hand in the rain, this I believe could be the blood rain we've seen  before in the last episode of season 3.

Next,  we get the shot of the painting style landscape full of bodies and  above them all stands the Attack Titan (probably Eren) reaching out with  an Armoured Titan (probably Reiner) visible behind him possibly showing  the battle in chapter 119. The Attack titan looks really demonic in  this and the imagery of it being at the top is really fitting given that  Eren has the Founding titan.

Overall,  this OP is hard to compare to the previous ones because of how  different it is. Its very aesthetically distinct and aims for different  things. Whereas previous OP's focussed more on characters and story with  Epic undertones this one seems to focus more on the horrors of war  while blending it in with propaganda that was so prevalent during this  time in our world. In terms of the song it really fits the visuals and  the theme they are going for. It seems slightly unnerving and creepy  whilst retaining a bit of the hype that characterised the previous OP's.

The Episode:

The episode was inconsistent in quality but in general very good. This section is a bit nitpicky:

The  first thing that was immediately obvious to me was Colt's ridiculous  running in the beginning, whilst not terrible in animation it just  looked a bit absurd and took me out of the episode. The new music  sounded familiar compared to earlier songs and in general fitted in very  well personally in the first section.

The  additions to the episode were I also love the added shots of the  trenches and showing how terrifying it is for the people there and how  exhausted they are. Later on in the episode I also liked the addition of  suicide bombers to hammer home how brutally Marley treats Eldians. The  scene with the soldier climbing over corpses also really helps to  establish the mood of the season.

One  thing that stuck out to me in a good way was surprisingly the animation  on Gabi's foot when she is unattaching the grenade, everything flowed  so well and it looked really natural. I appreciate that MAPPA also kept  the midroll information sheets  as well as the episode number cards and  to be continued card.

Occasionally  it was obvious that they were obscuring peoples mouths to cut down on  the ammount of time they were needing to animate but overall the still  frames were good. Upon watching it again the CGI used for certain things  has grown on me especially with the armoured train and the arial shot  of the Fort. The CGI with Cart and Jaws was surprisingly good although  not as amazing as they were in the trailer. The both of them themselves  were hard to tell apart from their hand drawn counterparts and the only  thing that caught me onto realising they were CG was their movement.  MAPPA really did the titan bombardment scene justice, also the lack of  censorship was interesting given that it is airing on the same network  as last season.

Probably my  biggest problem with the episode was Armoured and Beast titans CGI, in  itself the CGI was actually passable but transitioning between shots was  terrible. The speed at which the action happens makes it hard to tell  what is happening sometimes so it doesn't help that both the beast and  armoured land, and then are presented in massively different ways. For  example, the beast comes down from the sky in a t-pose style before  transitioning in the very next frame to having his manga pose of hand  reached out to the ground with another behind pointed to the sky. Also  the beast's face looks really uncanny valley even compared to his style  in WIT.

Finally, the blend between  the beast throwing the shells to the naration to the scene with Jean  was so smooth and well executed. The last scene especially was really  well done and gives me a lot of hope for the festival scenes, it looked  exactly how I would have expected a good WIT adaptation to look but with  a depth of field blur added. I understand why some people might be  against Jean's appearance but for the casual viewer if they are able to  surmise his identity it will give them some hope of returning to their  main cast and to the ones that don't guess who he is it adds in that  mystery that drove seasons 1 through 3.

Overall,  the episode was a 9/10 which is better than I expected although it  leaves a bit of room to be desired. The backgrounds and character  designs were consistent, well presented and detailed which I loved. The  additions give me hope for a more fleshed out world and the pacing was  perfect. Whilst the worst thing was obviously the CGI, I believe that as  long as the quality remains consistent they will grow on me and get  better.

The ED:

Obviously  we have only seen the last part of the ED so it is possible that there  are things in the first part that indicate different things.

The  ED it starts with falco standing infront of a wall (possibly one on  Paradis) with birds flying in the background, these are probably just  part of the general bird symbolism in the series.

Then  images appear behind him showing general images of the battle and we  get a closeup of his face probably to show how the fighting impacted  him. The title of the ed ""shock"" probably relates into this as Falco to  some extent is suffering shell shock or something similar, a relatively  common thing in WW1 for soldiers to get.

It  goes on to show Falco closing his eyes and thinking of a phoenix flying  obviously in reference to his dream before it explodes into a ball of  light. out of which many string like effects appear. I believe these to  be a representation of paths, they make up the body of the phoenix after  all. We then see Ymir with the paths tree behind her and you can see  the paths coming off it, I love the pan up here and the slow growing of  the tree.

We then see the screen  fill with the paths and then they are condensed down into a sphere that  Falco grabs, in reference to him gaining the power of the titans, before  finally the scene where Falco reaches out to a bird.

Overall  the ED is great, breathtaking song and stunning visuals although it,  like the OP, is very distinct from the other ED's it probably overall my  2nd favorite ED behind Season 2's."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,epabafree,all the decisions are of AoT Production Team and MAPPA. So please stop blaming them and the animators. AoTProd gives an ungodly deadline and no slack even during Covid and wants it as polished as possible. It aint happening like that bros
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,stopbeinggaymikasa,The cgi started looking good with the cart and the jaw in the beggining but started to look bad for the armored and beast near the end. I think its okay tho because this was a short fight and they are saving the good stuff for the war hammer titan fight
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,e_m_a_n_r_e_s_u_,"Overall 7-8/10.

Plot: It's Attack on Titan... Of course it's a 10/10! Seriously though, for an introductory episode, it began the season with hype. (Since it's in the manga, I will leave it at that.)

Art/Animation: I really do not like CGI, but S4E01 did CGI much better than I expected. Still, the CGI feels unnatural, especially in an anime like AoT. I really hope they animate Eren vs WHT well, preferably without CGI. I was expecting something closer to the trailer (where I didn't notice any CGI, or at least I don't remember any). I'm not for or against Mappa's art style. Art/Animation: 7/10.

Music: I noticed they reused some of the music from the trailer. This is not a complaint though. That was some dope music. 8/10, no complaints.

The opening was beautiful and perfectly captures the dark and somewhat mysterious vibe of the Marley and Rumbling arcs. I cannot wait to see EREH!!!!

Edit: I also love that in the end of the opening, they clearly show Eren's Attack Titan, being followed by some titans. I wonder what that symbolizes ;)"
e_m_a_n_r_e_s_u_,Matterfied,Every titan will be CGI throughout all episodes apparently.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mohwi,"Overall good episode, human scenes looked great for the most part, i just don't understand why mindless titans are 2d animated when the shifters are cg, it doesn't look as good imo"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,soupzYT,CGI looks great except for monke but I'll let it slide. Very happy :)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,moving_asunder,"Solid 9.5/10 my only complaint is beast titan CG which was dodgy at parts, particularly the drop in but the throw was very well executed. I love the voice actors, Gabi is a little shithead as she should be. The anime original stuff was spectacular, really adds more weight to the fact that Eldians are just throwaway grunts for the Marleyans. The opening part was very well done, great sound design all around. We‚Äôre off to a very good start ladies and gents.

Also, Falco‚Äôs line about flying around with a sword has some....interesting connotations."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Txkagi-san,"the cgi is definitely the best ive seen in an anime, but its cg nonetheless. my main nitpick about cg is the way it seems so sluggish compared to the regular animation. it almost feels like its animated in a lesser framerate. ex: say regular animation is in 60fps, the cg feels like its in 30fps and feels like its moving in a gridsnap enabled dimension of its own. really wish wit just did this season instead of mappa. i would've been more than fine with cgtitans in the rumbling, thats expected, but really mappa, cg titans for almost every shot?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"after watching the OP for the 10th time I'm starting to like it more, I just wish it more dark and less repetitive, it needed more blood, red-ish colours, but the song is lit as fuck"
ragnaroksoon,5437354724,It is repetitive and stagnant in odd sequences. I‚Äôll get used to it. Opening and closing segment were kino.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wrathandweeping,"Things I liked:

- 2D animation : some sequences, like the bird flying to the port while Gabi gave her recap, or Reiners transformation, were amazing ‚Äî detailed, immersive, fluid, gorgeous 
- 3D animation: honestly, most of it. Very fluid and well blended 
- added scenes / changes: I didn‚Äôt love the 1:1 panel adaptation from Wit. Respectful but can be boring as a manga reader. Cool they changed/added some things while honoring the source material 
- hearing some old AOT music 
- the washed out color palette. Hated it in the PV, but grew on me here once I accepted no longer seeing WIT‚Äôs striking, vibrant colors 
- opening and ending. I love abstract art, and I love weird typography. Cool how the text appears and disappears asymmetrically throughout, and always respect trying something different 

Things I disliked:
- the blur. Was hoping that was a trailer only thing. Just rewatched hoping I was mistaken, but damn. It flattens everything ‚Äî even when the shading and motion is dynamic and conveys depth. At the very least the filter setting is too high and constant. As a digital artist I lean on blur to soften my mistakes sometimes... but seems like it‚Äôs always on. Honestly gives me a headache 
- Direction. Everything is fluid and realistic, which is cool, but ‚Äî too much so. MAPPA doesn‚Äôt let the frames pause and breathe to give dramatic weight or let us appreciate designs, entrances, twists, etc. Blink and you miss it; gone is that anime stylization that really slows down the action to emphasize specific moments and make them ‚Äúepic‚Äù
- new OST. Im sorry but I hate it. Generic strings brass instruments etc. Old OST blended those components with crazy electronic stuff and Gregorian chants and all other kinds of weirdness and catchy melodies... this is much more lazy and cliche. 
- too much CGI. MAPPA‚Äôs CGI is dope, and blows WIT‚Äôs out of the water. But WIT only used theirs sparingly: colossal, horses, roof tiles, etc. Seems like it‚Äôs used with every shifter, even during still frames / close ups, although these don‚Äôt quite happen anymore due to the direction issue noted above. 

Overall: pumped. Even tho the audiovisual aesthetic of S1-3 was probably my favorite aspect of the show, and I do consider this inferior with respect to my personal tastes... I really do appreciate MAPPA stepping up and giving it their all, and I did enjoy this. Despite my criticisms, all my love to MAPPA for this adaptation and I‚Äôm excited to see their take on the rest of the story"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,little_effy,"Holy shit is all I can say. It‚Äôs just SO good. I dunno about the CGI or what other commenters are talking about, I honestly didn‚Äôt notice anything bad about the animation quality. But holy shit! 

MAPPA it seems is much better at holding our attention with the pacing, the music, the action sequence. Even the added scenes that the manga doesn‚Äôt have also only make the fight scenes more epic. 

Plus, MAPPA‚Äôs best feat of all - making Gabi likeable in this arc lmao"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Catzareawesome1,"I wanted to be optimistic about the CG titans, but to be honest it's a little distracting at times, like when Galliard tilted his head down at Gabi and Falco. I really hope it's not like that in future fight scenes"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Freedom_scenery,"Personally I didn't like the overuse of Cgi, I mean they could've blended hand-drawn animation there and there. Now I'm worried about how Eren vs warhammer gonna look like..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,14MySterY-,People here are overreacting about the CGI.
14MySterY-,chanduredd,They were expecting for it to be bad because it's cgi and now they are subconsciously trying to nitpick everything.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheOnlyReal-reZanCe-,"Everything was fine except the CGI. The Jaws titan looks great in CGI no complaints, the carttitan is meh, Armored looks like leggo bricks and beast stands out too much."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,damn so we have an ugly bastard as a snk character now
ragnaroksoon,MMD_933_,"Yeah they did Koslow bad, he looks totally different from the manga"
MMD_933_,ragnaroksoon,"really different, I didn't even recognize him"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dernak,"I don't understand why they completely replaced the hand-drawn shots shown in the PV with CGI, especially the Porco train tracks shot - other than that the episode was great and the OP is just as soul-crushing as I expected (although I expect things to be added on top of the empty smoke shots as the season progresses)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Dxuian,Everything was great except cgi for the armored and beast
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TrojanXP96,"Man, they teased us so bad with that epic Jaw and Cart scenes in the trailer and I know my expectations were too high, before watching the episode I even read that titans were CGI, but even then I'm left with blue balls here.

My guess is they decided to use CGI on titans considering the amount of titan scenes they'll have to do in the future and they didn't want to switch from hand-drawn to CGI all of a sudden in the middle of the season, I'm ok with that.

Then there's this issue of CGI not blending with the background, the titan fps being choppy in some shots etc. I'm sure at least some would agree it was very weird. I haven't watched other shows from MAPPA but I guess I can attribute this to studio's characteristic style, so this is also ok.

There's the part in the trailer where Galliard jumped on soldiers after bending the rail with his Jaw, they removed the pouncing part for some reason, though I'm glad he was masterfully represented as this fast feral frontliner.

Also there's Cart's first scene, they changed that shot a bit and it's generally fine but the angle is so weird for some reason. The trailer angle was definitely better imo.

Reiner with his gunnars looked badass.

Idk wtf that op was (maybe they'll add to it later?) but the ending was pretty good. I wonder if every episode will end blended with the music. If not, then that ending could be a shortened version or something and we might see a full version some other episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,se1zure_toxic164,"The anime original line and scenes were very fitting and added alot imo and i hope that isayama is overlooking everything and changes some of tge things he didn't have time to change in the manga

And also the voice acting for everyone accept maggoth were pretty good and gabbi's was my fave

I'm really excited to hear best girl's voice next ep cuz i had a mini heart attack seeing her in the teaser for first ep"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,techieshavecutebutts,It felt like it's a new anime... Damn MAPPA you outdid yourselves
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lawncorazon,I wonder how S4 would look like with Ufotable CGI
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vihurah,"also did anyone else notice they mixed part of ""flugel der freiheit"" into the OP, i thought that was awesome"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thot_buster04,New animation is ok but I missed the old one and I wish the op was made by link horizon but that ending with Jean thoe üò≥
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Walrussealy,Lol this episode reminded how much I hated Gabi. Great first episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nenhatsu,CGI was great. It almost looked 2d
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daphne_Ackermann,Mappa goat üî•
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,WhipsandPetals,"I watched it when the spanish subs came out yesterday since the eng subs took longer to be released. I liked that they kept the color scheme the previous seasons used. I love how closely the landscape and colors resembles WIT's because those were wallpaper worthy. Cgi was good on fast paced scenes but when movements were slow, the lower frame rate is noticeable and awkward. Was looking forward to seeing Galliard's first look mid jump in air so I was disappointed it wasn't shown. I thought that was the coolest in the chapter when I first read it. The episode was ok. I was hoping it would give me the chills and thrill I got reading the manga so it was quite a letdown. I watched the opening twice to confirm if I felt anything but there was nada. The song was good but the film was just a series of repetitive explosion so that was huge upset."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tehsigzorz,"Some notes to make here:  

VAs were perfect and I loved magaths more than I should  

Most of us agree ending is great but I also love the opening(same stuff is being said about it as red swan so we will see how this song ages)  

Ost was great and the lack of it during the battle had great effect 

I expected a bit more from the CGI with their reputation tbh, gonna take a while to get used to but its decent."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisoka_lover92,I liked the ending more tbh
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,justchilling320,"OP is fucking amazing, perfect tone setter for this arc"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ccfnicolas,"That was beautiful, everything I wanted for the first episode. I was clapping and stomping my feets while Reiner, Porco and Pieck were attacking lol. That scene showing different Eldian soldiers panicking before charging into the battlefield gave me chills, really nice addition. CGI looks impressively good. Zeke screaming was adapted perfectly!

Can't wait for 61."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HungarianBassoon,"WOW! The cg worked pretty well, and the op was perfect! Better than expected!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HistoriaTheFirst,"While I hate the bird titan in the manga, the ED was beautiful."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nic-oh,"while the 3D looks absolute amazing, its still 3D and can feel off putting at times, they also use it for every titan and big moving object so I kind of feel conflicted. However now I'm assured that Mappa was the best choice for eventually animating the rumbling."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DalePooper,I absolutely wouldn't ask for a link to a pirate link of this episode and if somebody would dm me the link I'd certainly would think twice before looking at it!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,macdondalds,"The episode was bloody amazing! Animation was perfect, but I didn't like the Beast Titan CGI. They need to improve that, you could see how terrible it was when he was landing at the Fort. Other than that, artstyle is amazing too. I won't even mention the soundtrack, it was epic! Can't wait for the next one, but I feel like I'm gonna get bored because Eren and others will come in like episode 6 or 7, as far as I read somewhere. 
I didn't like the opening, the song is boring and the visuals are terrible and out of place, like, where are the characters? Only explosions now i guess. 
I like the new characters too. Gabi is cute and cool, Falco seems to me like he's going to be the main character for a while, I don't like their commanders tho. Also the lion-like titan was sooo cool!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EatlikethatguyUknow,"Incredible! Can‚Äôt wait for next episode. The only thing that kind of threw me off was Reiners CGI model. It looked thinner than the drawn one, it‚Äôs a nitpick I know but it didn‚Äôt stop me from really enjoying the episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ham__solo,"Can anyone tell me why the shows uses CGI for titans in general? It doesn‚Äôt bother me I was just wondering if there was a particular reason

Edit: Thanks for the info folks! It‚Äôs good to hear the animators get a bit of an easier time"
ham__solo,Tobibobi,"For this episode in particular, it's because of very fast and complex movement. I imagine a lot of the scenes with less complex movement will not be CGI."
ham__solo,neverknowsless,"the main reason is using CGI for titans is the pipeline to animate is much more streamlined & it saves a boatload of time. basically with CGI models all you have to do is draw the textures on the model, find good shaders and that's it for the most part, after that it's just animating limbs & faces through rigs (rigs are essentially skeletons, you just move the limb/joints/etc. to animate them). i wouldn't say that animating through 2D is much more difficult with references to go off of, but it it definitely much more time consuming which in turn makes it more difficult b/c you have to draw and color each individual frame. there are things nowadays that make the pipeline for that easier, but for designs as complex and numerous as the titans in the series you can see how that can be hard to do. 

tl;dr with 3D models, you have your assets made already and you can literally just insert models into scenes whenever and start animating while with 2D animation you generally have model references/turnarounds to use but assets aren't pre-made for you so u gotta draw everything frame by frame."
ham__solo,XeliMoon,It's easier to animate and saves alot of time and money rather than having to draw a frame for every position the titan is in.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Otheagony,"Episode did a mighty fine job of pulling me in, it was all choreographed how I imagined it would when I read the manga. For around the first 70% of it I couldn't of guessed that it was animated by a different studio if I wasn't aware beforehand. But when the climax of the episode begun and a lot more started happening, all the CGI was quite jarring to me, especially after 59 episodes of getting used to WIT titan animation. But it didn't really ruin the episode for me, I reckon I can get used to it within a few episodes though it will probably always be bugging me a bit in the back of my mind. Overall though, a pretty darn strong start."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheHudsonForge,"I know a lot of you are still on the fence but I thought the CGI was fucking stellar. Probably the best implementation of CGI in an anime that I have ever seen. 

MAPPA have my undying respect, I don‚Äôt know what I would have done if they had fucked it up but it looks like they are doing a phenomenal job.

We are still yet to see 3DMG animation but I have faith in them."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,evascale,"Remember when we didn't like CGI Bertholdt back in season3? Now, we get every titan made with CGI. Sorry folks, but I just don't like it. I am so glad I've read the manga now.

Also, there were a big lack of music compared to previous seasons, what's going on with that? One of the big aspects of what made AOT the AOT we know are the music, and in this episode, I didn't feel it."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_Ozilus_,"Would I miss WIT's superior art and their 2d Titans? **Hell yes!**

Did I love the entire new feel this season gives and the amazing work Mappa is doing... **HELL YES!**

Not even us manga readers are ready!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Haggardfounder,I am liking the op the more I listen to it. I really wish Eren vs warhammer is not CG
Haggardfounder,QuietRezo,"It‚Äôs Guilty Gear levels of CG. As a Digital Artist, I‚Äôm in awe and can‚Äôt believe people are complaining  ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
Haggardfounder,cassiiii,The CG looks fluid as hell wym
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vendetta231,Reading the anime only thread of the episode is such a fun experience. It's like all the people there are little simulations created for us lmao.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TrainwreckOG,Do I understand it right that the warhammer vs eren fight is going to be entirely CGI?....
TrainwreckOG,ragnaroksoon,"yes, all titans will be CGI probably"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lmaomanemjef,"sucks so much that they are doing titans in cg, it's gonna lower the impact of so many scenes..."
lmaomanemjef,Chaos-Reach,"I think as long as they don't CG the whole season (especially Eren vs Warhammer) it'll be ok. There's simply too much action to cover in every single episode for them not to CG a ton of the titan stuff. 

One prediction I'm making right now though is that Eren's rumbling form is gonna be CGed to hell and is going to look horrible. I really hope I'm pleasantly surprised, but I also wouldn't be shocked."
Chaos-Reach,lmaomanemjef,"yes, I agree, if they do the important fights without CG then I'm fine with that

if the whole seasons will be cg then... ouch

like bro I actually can't imagine declaration of war and Eren vs Warhammer in cg, I refuse to think we've waited so long for a CG adaptation üòÇ"
lmaomanemjef,clorox_baratheon,honestly isn't that bad. not a deal breaker at all imo
clorox_baratheon,lmaomanemjef,"the cg is fine, but it will NEVER replace hand drawn frames

it just takes me out of the experience"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hossel001,"My opinions are mixed. On the one hand, the actual action itself was directed well. On the other.. the CG kind of disappointed me. It is fine, it's not bad CG, it's just way too fluid, contrary to everything else. Also, the music went on for like.. too long? Like, half the episode had this epic combat music, which kind of lost its effect by the end. Keep in mind though that I am being very nitpicky here.

Opening was very unorthodox, but I kinda like it. The ending on the other hand was fucking fantastic. Like, holy hell, that shit bangs. 

The average WIT episode was like an 8.5-9.0 / 10.

This episode was a strong 7 / 10.

So not bad by any margin, just, the quality drop was a bit too noticable. Funny, I had a conversation about this with another redditor yesterday, defending MAPPA, even without seeing the episode first. While I still think that being optimistic is a better outlook on life, I may have to be a bit more skeptical from now on."
hossel001,blowtorches,music direction sucked imo
hossel001,Final-Solid,I love WIT but there‚Äôs a lot of revisionist history going on here. The episode overall looked better than S3P2. Obviously S2 is still the best AoT art IMO.
hossel001,Martin7431,"totally respect your opinions, but i'd have to disagree. i think this episode was easily on par with most of the episodes from previous seasons, with the major exceptions being in season 3 part 2."
hossel001,jung2019,You've clearly forgotten horrible CGI in Rots.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Truthgamer2,"Honestly, udo‚Äôs meltdown scene felt really goofy and just generally off tone for AOT if you ask me"
Truthgamer2,coolman1997,You ever heard of this girl Sasha?
Truthgamer2,Jaka45,"Dude that scene also in the manga.

You forgot about it ?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,bod3flick3r,[Link to the raw episode](https://w02.shingekinokyojin.tv/shingeki-no-kyojin-season-4-episode-1/?source=vidstream2)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SteveStacks,"I mean Crunchy roll needs to step their game up. 6 hours is a long wait for a rabid AOT fanbase.

We are just not going to wait that long, Crunchy you know that."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lilguinea,"wow i can‚Äôt believe the big twist, i would of never expected John cena to show up"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaiserigen,"Not sure if that many CGI was necesary, WIT did fine drawing Titans"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Flosoney61,Great episode. I forgot how much I hate Gabi lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Accelerator-Deflect,Finally watched the ep I honestly loved gabi this ep too bad imma get that fresh reminder of why I used to hate her soon. The CGI was very noticeable and somewhat distracting but not cause it was bad but new I just gotta adapt to it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zurita1,"Everyone who isnt saying that the CGI is perfect gets a ton of hate, when people write valid complains about the bad CGI they just get downvoted.
You have to say that the snk videogame monkey looks great to get upvotes here"
zurita1,depressome,"Yeah, this thread is a bit of a circlejerky pro-MAPPA echo chamber."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Uncle_Gupa,How many spoilers did you catch in the op? I caught one but I hear there are others.
Uncle_Gupa,tehsigzorz,Isnt it just the transformation or founder eren possibly and maybe zeke gassing ragako village? What did u find?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hopeitwillgetbetter,"On the CGI thing, I watched the episode twice on a 4k LED.  For me, it looked very nice.  (I had trouble telling what's CGI and not.)  Caveat - I don't know whether the 4k thing actually applied.

At least it ain't like the latest Ghost in the Shell series, cause that's an example of CGI I had trouble with.

Another example would be Final Fantasy: Spirits Within vs Final Fantasy: Advent Children.  I have trouble with the former, but love the latter."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PBandJslime,I mean everyone can have varying opinions on the animation style. But HOLY SHIT THE MUSIC IS THE BEST
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yonatankapi,"Finally had to watch the episode for the first time, and with two of my friends. Pacing was great. OP is good, ED is awesome. I enjoyed the music but it seemed like the music was going in a loop forever, even in moments where it doesn't feel right. I was staying positive but cgi just wasn't that good most of the time. Unpopular opinion probably, but the Plot Armor Titan looked the worst, and the slowness. Angles were a bit disappointing sometimes, but that's fine I guess. Most of what I said here makes it seem as if I didn't like the episode at all, but in fact I liked it very much, and was enjoying finally having season 4. My friend who read up to the end of Marley saga seemed to be excited during the episode,but had the same criticism as me. He said that the animation as a whole got somewhat worse, and the other one agreed with him. The former still looks forward for chapter 100ish the most, and he still hates Gabi for potatoing Sasha, cause she was probably one of his favourites, and he didn't get the full picture yet.

Although the episode was overall great, I am still pretty down, and I REALLY hope it will get better, especially for 100ish and 120-122."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Herobrinedanny,The CGI looks fuckin amazing. Monke was done well.
Herobrinedanny,rowanrawr,Based danny
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,"Music is okay. They curbed the soundtrack to only trailer music on loop for the entire second half of the episode.

I hope they enhance variation. I would NOT like to see declaration of war with that soundtrack lol."
5437354724,ragnaroksoon,"yeah, that got me worried, especially because snk's ost was always top tier. hope they won't be afraid of using more songs...if they actually have more songs. I hope that the budget was enough for that"

asadhoe2020,coraaline,"It was the Japanese premiere, we watched it on a janky twitch stream. Funimation and Crunchyroll will still premiere subbed later"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iluvsnails,They showed Ymir in the ed wow !!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Haggardfounder,Well the ED visuals indicate falcos flying titan and Ymir with paths tree.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sotterof1995,"Good start. I will have to watch the episode again in better quality to properly enjoy it. That being said, I am still worried about pacing as the show goes on.."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tacer8,Does anyone have a screenshot of Willy/Jean at the end? If the trim is pointy on the chin then it‚Äôs Jean.
Tacer8,HistoriaTheFirst,"It‚Äôs not even a contest. It‚Äôs Jean. The hair color, facial hair, everything gave away it‚Äôs jean."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoFlavour,"The guys who are complaining about the cgi are crazy. 

This episode was simply amazing.

Only certain shots had cgi that looked out of place... (like when the beast when he landed), but even after that he looked completely fine."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ScoopJr,Any idea on when the next episode airs?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dogsgotocollege,"ok so there's sooo many rumors about how long this season will be. now the consensus is 16 episodes covering up to ch. 122? does that mean we'll get a movie for the final chapters maybe? or a part 2 for the rest of the chapters? it's weird how we don't know yet 

honestly would be so down for a movie tho, as long as are able to stream it worldwide right away unlike demon slayer"

When is this? clearly flashback right? What is this war in relation to? I haven't engaged any with AoT since the end of season 3 aired so it has been a while. 

Anyone care to orient me? Make the memories come flooding back!"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maypie26,"That was awesome!? Like, the first ep really showcased how epic this arc is going to be. The tension was through the roooof! Also, love Reiner's voice lol"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Iewoose,"So we see birds falling, but the camera moves upwards which creates an effect of them falling Backwards? 
It's also showed *Before* and not *after* the shot of them flying. 

I wonder if that has any significance."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ThomiAnwar,"As someone who's only watched the anime adaptation, am I missing something in between eps 59 and 60? Because I can't keep up with what's actually happened. And I just don't like the new characters, especially those brats."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Clemenx00,"Lmaooo Crunchyroll crashed, piracy stays winning."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ArgentWolfBlade,"Y'all moaning about the CGI need to get a fucking grip haha, that entire episode was lit."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lekaetos,"Ep was great and gave me goosebumps

You guys are super lucky and get to watch the episode before most of the subs and all you talk about are your negative aspects blah blah CGI blah blah Opening.

You waited 1.5 years and right after the first ep you already find something to bitch about.

Supposedly Eren vs WTH blah blah like you don‚Äôt know how it will be handled so stfu for real"
Lekaetos,cidalkimos,"Yeah, it‚Äôs annoying. Especially considering the restraints with Covid and such. Like be grateful."
Lekaetos,Evan_Is_Here,"Might be controversial, but being a fan of something doesn't mean being required to be pleased with everything all the time.

If I love this story so much that I want to see it animated in a way that I love, seeing it animated in a way that I don't love is disappointing, and I want to express that. If I've seen this story and its animation at its best, I want to continue seeing it at its best.

Now this an exaggeration because while I didn't like the CGI, I still loved the episode and found that the CGI gets easier to look at the more you do it. 

It's impossible to expect an animation with a perfect budget because life is messy, and MAPPA is the only studio willing to pick up this series.

So basically yes, I can complain if I want to; it doesn't make me a whiny bitch, it makes me a fan of the series"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IIToxSickII,"Honestly it was a valiant effort by MAPPA, but to me it really doesn't feel like Attack on Titan. Maybe we just need to get used to the CGI..."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gasfar,I miss the time were the colosal titan being CGI was a problem üòÖ
Gasfar,Clemenx00,Lucky for us nothing in this episode was even close as bad as the CGI Colosal was.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bewaremysteamroller,"Me when seeing opening: ""wait, it's all monke spinal fluid?""

Mappa: ""Always has been.""

Jokes aside, the new opening was amazing"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zeezof,ha ha CGI go brrrrr
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,not_martian,The main problem I felt ( a lot of people aren't even talking about it lol) is jaw Titan's  hair . When it moves the hair is just there without any motion at all. Whereas the pv jaws was just perfect imo . This jaws hair is even more of a letdown to me than monke
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gasfar,"Can't wait to see you all try to justify CGI Eren in the declaration of war.

""At least mikasa doesnt say ereh too much tho"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheZombi3z,"That OP is actually literal dogshit I'm gonna be honest. Really liking the animation of the episode though, the CGI was pretty seemless."
TheZombi3z,Umbrabro,Yes it's ass. Don't see how people are defending lmao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Yuiiski,"I'll be honest, I didn't like the look of the 3D Armoured and Beast Titan, other than that I thought everything was fantastic, it was cool seeing Jean at the end too."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,chillininthebasement,Omg I loved it! Was that Jean at the end?! Thanks for reminding me why I'm on Eren's side. Fuck Marley.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Blorghnoth,"I want to hug every animator who worked on this, gawd dayum!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Vasllui,"So that guy had to be Jean right? Weird choice, i wa ssure they were gonna show us Hobo"
Vasllui,SolemnDemise,"Hobo is next episode, for sure."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Baller4Jesus27,WAIT ITS ALREADY OUT? WHERE U GUYS WATCHING IT?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zedeed,Well done MAPPA you didn't let us down.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,753509274761453,"I thought the Jaw and Armor looked good, the Beast not so much and I would prefer they not make the titans' mouths move at all when they communicate with each other. Nothing seems to have been cut from 91/92 and the only difference is there was more focus on the Eldian infantry and the ending scene with Jean. I'm not sure I like Jean being included because it will make it seem like he's cooperating with Eren when the Scouts didn't begin to make preparations to help until after Falco delivers Eren's letter which obviously hasn't happened yet."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zan100,Holy Eren balls I have only seen the new op but man that may be contender for the best yet.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,"I always love a good ‚ÄúRIP SnK, this is gonna suck‚Äù, in the leaks thread. And after so many months it feels good to read it on an anime thread as well. Keep it up trolls."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Suzukinobuko,"Can‚Äôt find it on Crunchyroll, r u guys using funimation?"
Suzukinobuko,Catzareawesome1,It drops in 40 mins
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,orias6606,"Could someone pls explain to me what was jean doing there?
i can't remember him being there when I read the Marley arc"
orias6606,TaffyLacky,The main squad is with Kiyomi and looking for Eren. Hence where Eren's letters end up.
orias6606,longjasonPP,"Jean was always there, blending in with the rest of the gang, mappa just teased a little to add hype im guessing"
orias6606,SilenceShade,"We did see only Eren but since the Scout Legion came asap to fight, we can assume most of them were in Marley."
SilenceShade,orias6606,Ok thank you
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,not_a_pyschopath,Wow japanese fans are vocal about the new episode and they are not happy. Theyre discontented with the new cast and the whole cgi thing. I guess they were holding out hope for a 2D route. There's even a petition that's garnered thousands of signatures to have the episode changed. Obviously that wont happen but it shows how unhappy they are.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yonatankapi,"I've not seen the ep yet because I want to watch it subbed with my friends, otherwise I didn't wait and would have watched the raw as well, but it's already night and we can't meet, so guess I'll have to struggle in school tomorrow. I already saw op, ed, and some shots. 

op is definitely not bad, I wouldn't talk shit about it, but I don't have much to say yet, and the song is pretty good although, I'd be happy to get LH.

ed is GREAT. First place with ending one probably, or even dethrones it. I like the parallel between ed6, Falco's ending, and ed1 Mikasa's ending.

I was hyping myself that we're getting a Willy Tybur tease, but it ended up being Jean. For a few minutes I was somewhat disappointed that the tease didn't happen, but tbh getting Jean is also great. 

When people were shit talking about cgi monke i was getting worried, and in fact, From the single image I saw of it until now, it does look weird, but whatever. Hope the climax of the saga will be good.

I also couldn't resist to see ep 2 pv, and I must say, I immediately started laughing because that commander (don't remember his name) looks like a mustache-less Hitler, and someone also pointed it out on Youtube so...

Off topic, I really think that  leakers are unfortunately hinting that the Rumbling will not be adapted as a TV anime.

Anyways, really hyped for the episodes!!


Btw I also think that it's lame that they're marketing season 4 as ""The Final Season"", while we're getting more, movie or not."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AFCBrandon,"The atmosphere and coloring was great. But the CGI was rough towards the end of the episode with the Beast Titan. 

I‚Äôm definitely not seeing that Jujutsu Kaisen effort so far :/"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,saylessMeyecul,I know my ex who first introduced me to episode 1season 1 is watching this episode. I Miss you
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Giuliano_Zhang,"as anime only I didnt understand everything but damn the action scenes were good and even tho the CG was really noticeable its not too bad, the OP was very chaotic and the ED was pretty good, if the final season ends up being good AOT is probably gonna be my favourite anime, I mean,  it already is for now"
Giuliano_Zhang,TheSilverSeraphim,Heads up that this sub is full of untagged manga spoilers cuz it's a manga-readers sub. If you wanna avoid spoilers you're best off going to /r/ShingekiNoKyojin or /r/attackontitan
TheSilverSeraphim,Kutzelberg,Thank you for giving him a heads up
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,"WHT v Ereh will be questionable. Its impact and intensity would be lost if not done with 2D, probably. Still I have no problem with the CG except when it‚Äôs lacking. The beast titan isn‚Äôt as intimidating anymore, maybe it‚Äôs the visual transition I find jarring, I dunno."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Abburakowski,Super pissed off that I cannot get the internet to give me a correct exact answer as to when I can watch this. Some sites say Hulu crunchy roll and funimation release it today at 245 EDT.. which shouldn‚Äôt even be right because right now it‚Äôs fall/winter when it should be the other whatever... but still per google it‚Äôs currently 250 pm EDT and it‚Äôs available for me in NONE of those sources. Other things say because they have it wrong and didn‚Äôt convert to fall/winter EST it‚Äôs another 5 hours away and it will be like 7 before it‚Äôs on those here in CST and I just want an exact ducking answer if someone here can give it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,doyoulikemessi,"Crunchy roll's dead, no choice but to resort to piracy üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
doyoulikemessi,icanaffordapenny,can u give me a link plz? i dont got premium
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TyrannosaurusRekt238,The CGI was really ehhhh espescially for Zeke
TyrannosaurusRekt238,Iamcarval,But much better than I expected so I don't have a problem with it. I liked the episode. Now I'll wait for the Crunchyroll subs.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AntiSharkSpray,Not gonna like the OP is kind of whack. The visuals are fine but the song itself...meh. And I‚Äôm someone who loved season 3A‚Äôs OP.
AntiSharkSpray,Randomemeseeker,"I don't know, I really liked the opening. It's all personal preference I guess."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gasfar,"I guess I'm just a contrarian lol. My opinions are basically the opposite of most people here. I don't like the new style at all and the CGI completely ruins it to me.

But that OP is fucking amazing. It fits the arc extremely well. And those 10 last seconds, with all the rumbling chapters still fresh in mind, are extremely chilling."
Gasfar,MuchOfPurple,"Yeah me too, but I'm surprised that many people loved it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Papastallin,">They used CGI on this episode and it was not that good, I'm so disappointed"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,andrewautopsy,"Man I just cannot stand Gabi‚Äôs arrogant fuckery. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to hate her more, but having to actually listen to her....ugh"
andrewautopsy,RyouKagamine,"I like I love her spunky attitude it‚Äôs cute it reminds me a bit of eren which I didn‚Äôt mind too much,I admit I might have a tolerance for characters like these so idk"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gmuni,With only 16 episodes I'm kinda worried the AoT anime will end on chapter 122. Then everything after will be a movie similar to Demon Slayer. I was sort of hoping that the anime would complete the journey. However From you 2000 years ago being the last episode is poetic I guess.
Gmuni,Hussor,"> I'm kinda worried the AoT anime will end on chapter 122. Then everything after will be a movie

Worried? I'm hoping for this. The rumbling deserves the highest budget."
Gmuni,Stew_2003,Theres gonna be a part 2
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,"So they showed Jean to satiate anime-onlies. I don‚Äôt like this decision. I‚Äôd rather they leave the 104th out of it until the imminent reveal. Well, I guess it‚Äôs just for hype factor and mystery so doesn‚Äôt impact anything really."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,"I don't think that Falco suits the attack titan tbh, Gabi is more suited for it, not that I think she will inherit it ofc"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,eggonsnow,Not a fan of the cgi but it's all we got so let's power through.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JuishJackhammer,"Am I the only one really disappointed with the op? Animation-wise it was...ok. CGI was best I‚Äôve ever seen, but it‚Äôs still just ‚Äúok‚Äù compared to the incredible quality wit gave us. Hoping to see more 2D and less exposition throughout the season."
JuishJackhammer,UltraPlasma,"You know how JoJo and some other anime add extra scenes, objects, and characters  in their op as the series progresses? It‚Äôs highly likely, that this is what MAPPA has in mind judging by the awkward no-object parts of the OP."
UltraPlasma,Zybloks,Yeah they confirmed they're doing exactly that
UltraPlasma,JuishJackhammer,I definitely hope that‚Äôs the case.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Onion-with-layers,"Uh, so far it's better than Tokyo Ghoul Re. Yes, they abused the cg. Yes, Reiner's titan got thinner. Yes, HONE's animations are more fluid and creative. But at least it's not a rushed slideshow."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Upbeat-Tank,Can someone explain me why Falco has such a big importance in the Ed lol like he indeed inherited of the jaw and there is this whole thing w the flying titan but like it didn‚Äôt have that much impact on the story when you think about it lol
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Crisisofland,"The CG is REALLLLY smooth, no comparison to WIT at all."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GS4WhenNinty,The ed is incredible
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Voi69,"Overall very good.

Feels likes the CGI dehumanizes titans... It strips them of something. They seem less real in a sense."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaulVader2,"That was... a wild ride.

First, let's get the minor complaint out of the way, obviously, the CGI Titans. Now, I didn't dislike them, the models are very high quality and I can only imagine how it looks in HD, but it'll take some time to get used to. I just hope that some key scenes like Eren's transformation during the Declaration of War are hand-drawn, since there's not much movement from his titan (the battle with the WH will obviously be CG, that I don't mind).

Besides that, I think the episode looks great. The pacing is perfect, I don't think they cut any lines from the manga, the movement is fluid, the character designs are extremely detailed and the VA's all did an amazing job! Unlike some, I quite liked the opening, it was a risk doing an op without any characters, but I think it payed off, it really sits well with the theme of the Marley Arc. The ending is great as well and I think that Falco is gonna have a far more important role in the resolution of the story then we may think.

Overall, fucking great episode, props to Mappa for putting this much effort into it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yolotitan,Sex
yolotitan,Vecus,sex.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Pax_Tumbleweed,I can't stop listening to the OP it's great haha
Pax_Tumbleweed,mario61752,Damn the opinions are polarized af. People either worship it or call it trash
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,Yea after about two listens I‚Äôm in the OP is great gang
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noraeffingdurst,I knew I should've taught myself Japanese so I don't have to wait for subs.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Turth3,Also Jean scene was worse then CG imo. Ruins the whole surprise but I guess the trailers already did that so fuck it.
Turth3,Taarabdh,"Jean is looking much different than S3, so I think majority of the Anime onlies would likely be unaware of who this person in a hat is, especially as we can only see the hair."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,FH261169,i dont see it on crunchyroll where are people watching tis
FH261169,RagingCabbage115,"We are at Isayama's watch party, where are u bro we are waiting for you"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iwasreallyshocked,"Assuming it's true that there only 16 ep., why hasn't announced Mappa that? They should say from the beginning that it's ""just"" Part 1."
iwasreallyshocked,itsalwaysblue59,WIT didn‚Äôt announce that S3 would be two parts until after the last ep of part one aired lol.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,GaelTheVapeMaster,"This episode was glorious and I'm really happy with it, but I have to be honest, the CGI titan movements stood out quite a bit and even after rewatching the last attack scene 3 times it still looked awkward. I LOVED everything else, but I really really hope they didnt use CGI for every single titan apperance/action scene."
GaelTheVapeMaster,MoFlavour,"It was a hit or miss, some cgi scene looked good, while others sticked out a lot.

Its a bummer, but definitely not jarring enough to make it unwatchable"
MoFlavour,GaelTheVapeMaster,"I agree. It looked preety good for the most part, but that Beast titan landing and the after shot of him talking was not that great. I just hope they didn't use it for most of the titan shifter fight scenes. That would kinnda suck"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,motmot730,The animation was a little wonky but the VAs were pretty good. Can't wait for the following episodes
motmot730,absolute--chad,It was mostly just the CG but even that was amazing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,oster01,I have to say I was expecting a lot more out of the opening but while watching i figured at least they dont spoil anything like season 3 pt 2
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,furikus,"ok idk if i can‚Äôt remember from the manga, but what did falco mean when he said ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt i flying just now with a sword fighting titans?‚Äù is that supposed to be a nod to the latest chapter?"
furikus,H-K_47,"Yeah it wasn't in the manga, it's an anime-only addition."
furikus,rowanrawr,"It was a memory of a survey corps member, he probably remembered Ymir using ODM gear, despite not inheriting the Titan until later. Paths is a strange concept..but it works."
rowanrawr,furikus,that makes sense. he said flying so my mind immediately went to his winged titan lol isayama has my head in a loop
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lsdwhale,"Quality wise - a clear downgrade, hopefully at least some more important fights will look better.
On the bright side  - the  opening is great - very different, but fitting for this arc"
Lsdwhale,Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,"Absolutely a downgrade, it‚Äôs a damn shame. Hopefully in important fights like Eren vs Warhammer there are improvements."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,richardtengcy,"First episode I highly rated at 8-8.5, was slightly let down by the choice of music and background music"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,5437354724,Based ass opening. MAPPA being chads. Nothing else to say.
5437354724,chicoisking,The ED is even better.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,erenismydaddy,I miss wit already lowkey
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spaghestis,HOLY SHIT THAT WHOLE TITAN BOMBARDMENT SEQUENCE WAS PERFECT LETS GOOOO FULL HYPE FOR MAPPA
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ankororo,I don't like the op the ED is banger tho
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Final-Solid,"I love WIT. S1 has great animation and S2 has the best art in AoT. But from S3 onwards and especially in Part 2, it gets very choppy and inconsistent. I‚Äôm not one to nitpick too much, so I still really enjoyed all their adaptations. But I feel like there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of revisionist history with people being like WIT was better etc. On an overall level, this episode felt on a similar level to the best of WIT. The best part is I doubt any episode will reach a level similar to the worst of WIT. They did a great job but we‚Äôre for sure looking back on WIT with rose-tinted glasses."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daddy-Dalton,"I think the most disappointing part of the episode was just how much cgi was used, it was used for all the shifters, machine guns, ships, etc

The guns and ships are understandable but it was kinda a letdown to see that all the shifters are cgi, especially since they were 2d in all previous seasons and 2d in the trailer Mappa put out back in May

Don't get me wrong, I think the CGI animation looked incredible (with the exception of the beast titan and some shots of the Jaws, which hopefully will get better as the episodes come out) but I'm sure if we all had the option, we'd all want them to be 2D

I'm just curious on why they made the change, why they showed one thing in the trailer and then did the complete opposite for the actual show

It makes me a bit worried about some of the upcoming anticipated fights like Eren v War Hammer or the Attack on Paridis, fights which I feel like won't be as impactful if they have clunky CGI, even if just a bit"
Daddy-Dalton,blueasian0682,"Have you seen the chapters isayama put up after this episode? The time restraints is also not helping them so mappa has no other option other than using cgi, sure 2d model is preferable but i would rather the animators not stress too much cuz the schedule is so tight. They had 6 months to animate season 4, that's barely enough time for a perfect next level animation and so far it's quite decent looking if you put in all the conditions mappa has to go through. The cgi is even better than wit studios collosul titan cgi imo."
blueasian0682,Daddy-Dalton,"The CGI definitely looks better than the CGI used during Wit's production, I'll give them that

And with everything going on in the world, it's understandable why they had to do it, at least they made sure to make it look good and not as jarring as the previous seasons

Although this is the first time in hearing about the 6 month production time, do you know when this was stated or if it's just a rumor? Since I find that surprising seeing as how talks about transferring studios started around 2 years ago and the final season was confirmed right after S3P2 ended in July 2019. Even with the pandemic, you'd think that they would have used the time between then and March to get some stuff done"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,InjusII,"I don't want to be a downer, I had such high hopes for this and even though I absolutely hate CGI, I was still trying to convince myself it will look good and I won't notice it, just like I didn't really mind Wit's colossal titan. 

But damn, I don't know the difference between good or bad CGI, is it blended well enough in the background or not, I am no professional but I can only tell that CGI is not something I like in general, and it looks incredibly stiff for me. 

And i'm just so disappointed seing how bad my boys Reiner and Zook look. Especially since all of their scenes in titan form are CGI. 

I mean when there is a lot of movement, the CGI isn't that bad and can be well integrated. But every fucking frame. There were so many still images that could have been 2D.

 And yes this is definetely a downgrade from WIT. Only the colossal and Rod were CGI, and tbh it wasn't too much of a bother since when there were 2D characters involved in the scene, the colossal was also drawn in 2D (like the scene Bertholdt kindapps Eren, the image where we see his hand holding eren, it is a 2D titan hand) while in this episode, even Monke's hand, zoomed in, when he grabs the missiles, is 3D. 

They could have at least tried to blend 2D animation within the 3D ones, especially for the still frames. 
Especially for the main  titan characters. I mean, the bombarding of titans from the plane had plenty of 2D titans, while our most important titan shifters looked like they came from a (bad) video game cutscene. 

I guess this was a way for us to get used to the CGI in order to prepare us for the rumbling, but i wouldn't have cared less if only the colossals in the rumbling looked CG while all the other episodes and other titans were 2D. I can't imagine Eren or Warhammer titan looking 3D. Or Grisha's titan in the flashbacks, or even Ymir's titan. All these important and amazing scenes will lack life and loose all impact on the watcher (or at least for me) if they are CG. 

That's just my opinion , I know you're all trying to stay positive and see the good in this new season, I was having hope too and trusted that SNK will be in good hands with MAPPA. I really tried, but I've lost all hype. 

I think everything looked good, the seiyuus were incredible as usual, the ost were perfect, the op and ed were good, but the fights, wich are so important in this season, looked so dull and childish for me. I felt no impact when stuff was thrown at titans, no feeling of everything being so small and vulnerable near the giant and creepy titans who fight in a war. I felt so many more emotions while reading the manga, and I feel like these CGI titans don't pay a nice tribute to Isayama's godly titan drawings. 
Especially since the animated version of a manga is supposed to give it life, these fights seemed dead to me, and i felt more life reading the scans compared to this. 

I am not trying to shit on MAPPA or anything, I believe they are giving it their best, and are taking it very seriously, it just isn't working for me. 

I'll miss the times everything was 2D, even the new Ghibli movie is a 3D one, I am at a loss of words. For me, animation looks most beautiful, fluid and natural when 2D. I know it's harder and takes a lot more time, but it's definetely worth it.
I wouldn't have mind if I had to wait a couple more years to watch SNK entirely animated by hand."
InjusII,WhipsandPetals,Everyone who is giving positive feedback for the cgi feels the need to tell other who hold the opposite view to fck off and stop complaining as if their opinions are the only ones that are valid. I used to study a little bit about animation so most times when I watch animated shows I get stuck on studying and criticizing cgi and that honestly takes away the enjoyment from watching. I'm hoping that the big fights would be much better animated than this episode.
InjusII,Not_A_Hate_Sub,"This, I hate everyone downvoting valid criticism of CG always being worse in aot"
InjusII,KirkDaJerk,"Yeah, that CGI was throwing me off...all the titan scenes: Armored Titan, Beast, the two quadruped titan attack, the Titan Airdrop did not look great to me, they looked off.  Most of these scenes were featured in the trailer and looked better in that trailer.  All that to say, I still really enjoyed it, I got into the episode and story.  I liked some of the character changes they made from the trailer too.  Looking forward to next week"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DARKH0ARSE,Hot take but not everyone is lying or forced when they say the new OP is lit. It's amazing and reflects the atmosphere of the season. The visuals are good but could be better
DARKH0ARSE,Vecus,Imagine being unable to comprehend people not having the same opinion as you ü§°
DARKH0ARSE,Final-Solid,The OP is lit
DARKH0ARSE,FullMetalCaterpillar,"First impression was I thought it was trippy and I liked it, but I hope they skip it a few times to give more time to the episodes. It may grow on me though.  
  
Edit: Needed time to process but it‚Äôs definitely growing on me in the 2nd and 3rd round of viewing. I started bopping my head to the music which means I probably will end up liking it a lot lol. I see it as all the other OPs are from the Paradise perspective and this is from Marley‚Äôs perspective."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wail-D,"Anyone else kind of disappointed about the first episode? Most of my anime only friends I watched it with enjoyed it (though they did have a few critiques). I personally felt like I hyped myself a bit too much. Like when the titans were parachuted down I was anticipating some epic sakuga but was thoroughly disappointed afterwards. When Gabi fell and did her throwing thing I expected the camera to follow the grenades and zoom out as the explosion happened (not saying I didn't like the anime version of that scene though)  


And at first, the slight usage of CGI was fine, I think the first 5 times they used CGI it actually looked good but then during the fighting it just felt off and not as impactful. Mainly because the music was also just... not hitting those key moments, the music was more so for a ""holy shit everything is happening at once"" moment but there wasn't all that much happening.  


To give the anime credit: I really liked Gabi's voice actress, so I'm really hyped to see her continuing and I'm honestly still hopeful they'll do the Marley invasion justice. But we can only hope..."
Wail-D,MoFlavour,"yeah the music didn't hit like it usually did.

It felt they just slapped in the music just for the sake of it. In previous seasons the music fit in with the animations.

Still, really hyped tho!"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xoliveralexander,Send link please!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HideAndZiq,The fact that the first closeup of Eren's attack titan in the OP kinda resembles a devil gave me goosebumps
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Levi_PigPiss,Is the episode out in english subs?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tehsigzorz,How can we find out of this episode was outsourced or not?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spare_Ice_4860,"For those worrying about CGI, I heard they're using it for the earlier eps due to budget, the later half will be full of action and they need the money for such. As we saw in the trailer, nothing but the colossal was CG. Let's hope MAPPA do a Kaisen and pull it back."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tryndamere_Main,How have you all already watched it if it hasn‚Äôt released yet
Tryndamere_Main,Abdullah7889,It‚Äôs out just not subbed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ch_ris_ax,Where can I watch season 4?? For free
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Seth450,"This episode may not have lived up to my expectations with the OP being a bit off (IMO) and the CGI being overused (and jarring at a few points) along with some other personal nitpicks
But that Ending.. Yo, that Ending is fucking fantastic. Literally gave me goosebumps, I fucking love it. It's actually the first time I'd rate the Ending far higher than the Opening in AOT.

But all in all, I feel I'd have to get used to the new take for the season but I'm hoping things get better (although I highly doubt it). Either way, I'm looking forward to future episodes but with lowered expectations sadly.

Edit: Ignore the first part, I'm actually addicted to the OP now :P and the CGI is far better in the official HD version.
So yeah, I'm hyped again."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,orandeddie,WOW I CANT WAIT
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maxwoof123,"This might be a dumb thing to ask but why didn‚Äôt they use the animation from the teaser? Imo the jaws titan looked so much better, he looked great in the episode but it still felt a bit off, like the hair and face, same goes for the cart titan, why go through all that trouble of animating those complex scenes for nothing? I get that it was a preview and most of the animation wasn‚Äôt meant to be used but dam it looked so cool, probably something to do with the budget too"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ah_Callie,I really really enjoyed it. (Also because I‚Äôm an emotional sap I teared up at the intro since it‚Äôs the final season). I think MAPPA has done a great job so far and I can‚Äôt wait to see the rest of it! It‚Äôs going to be awesome seeing so many great moments finally animated.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoFlavour,YOOO WE'RE IN HOT BABY
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HailZorpe,This episode was aggressively mediocre. The visuals were lackluster and the music was really bland. Not something that I was expecting for a first episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yonkojiri,"Mappa did too many animation changes. the 3D ruined the fight, wit studio was able to animate fights without 3D just fine. Why can't Mappa?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,nihaobrian94,Where can I watch this besides crunchyroll and funimation?  Funimation is just a black screen and I dont' got crunchyroll premium.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spyer2k,"Who was the bearded person at the end? Yelena?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Bforhan618,"That was chapter 91 and 92, at this rate we are expecting  24 or 25 episodes this final season(depending on 3 or 5 more Manga chapters left), aren't we?"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thefoxishere16,I CANNOT be the only one who heard the super smash brothers theme in the intro!!!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MajorScrotum,"This episode was great but it seemed a little exposition-heavy. I can't remember, was it like that in the manga? I thought it was pretty weird for Gabi to have Falco snap out of it by saying ""hey remember this war we've been in for the past four years?"" And then we got a brief history run down in the middle of a battle"
MajorScrotum,Anniemal_Nitrate,Yes it's like it is in the manga
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LtGeneral-Obasanjo,How long is this season gonna be?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noraeffingdurst,"Anyone know what time this ended up premiering on Hulu, est?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,adel_zx,I forgot what is up with the people on the plain why do they look like that?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,smegma_toast,"If that is Jean at the end, that must have taken place when the Paradis folks visited Marley undercover right?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lisbethman,"I kinda feel like the anime could be a different time loop than the Manga. Falco did not have the flashback in the Manga. Some people said that isayama might have forgotten to add it then, but that seems a bit odd to me. Also the split at chapter 122 would be perfect to make the part after that different... In the Manga, during the rumbling Connie said something like ""how could we get to this end?"" so that kinda implicated an alternate ending to me.. I don't know, I don't have real proof. But everything about eren would fit into that idea. I think the Manga happens first, and the anime is after that. It seems as if eren tried different things to solve the Paradis problem, but nothing worked, so when he can, he goes with the rumbling (he said something like ""because you're here, I now have this path"" to zeke). Maybe the anime is a loop even after that, with another additional happening, giving him another path? The ending was so focused on Falco and I don't see any reason for that when looking at the Manga. So, theory: Falco will eat eren for some reason in the anime (eren probably will know about how useful it would be to get eaten by Falco), and that's why Falco has the flashback to survey corps. He didn't have that in the Manga so at the end of the Manga, he will not eat eren. That would be a time-line where Falco does not gain the ability to see through time and manipulate it. So eren will learn something during Manga timeline that makes him believe getting eaten by Falco might solve something, so in the next loop, the anime, he tries that. Isayama said the anime is the ultimate version of the story...maybe because we've been looking at two different timelines all this time?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Angeloloys,is there already a spoiler for chapter 136??
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mononlabe,"Has anybody realized that in the opening ""This is my last war"", it resembles the world's view in WW1 that they defined it as ""the war to end all wars""?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Truthgamer2,Episode 2 discussion thread?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ragu262,"It was alright ig, zeke cgi looked like a ps2 game and Reiner wasn‚Äôt much better, jaw titan looked good tho idk why they didn‚Äôt use the trailer footage for the jaw and cart titans, it would‚Äôve looked better"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Accelerator-Deflect,I ain't watch the ep yet but these comments about CGI titans is scaring me I hope it doesn't look as bad as ya make it out to be üòî.
Accelerator-Deflect,jung2019,Ignore the nitpickers. CGI is better than season 3
Accelerator-Deflect,Hussor,"They're good in general but there is one scene which is quite jarring, namely when the beast titan falls."
Accelerator-Deflect,relativokay,"Nah, it's fine. It actually blends in so well, that I sometimes didn't even notice it."
Accelerator-Deflect,Lord_mush,They're better compared to previous cgi titans people just still salty at studio switch
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,CGI for all Titans is not slapping at all. Clear downgrade from WiT Studio. But it is what it is.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SteveStacks,What's the big deal with the opening? The weakest opening in the entire series
SteveStacks,Vecus,it'll grow on you
SteveStacks,Wingleesharm,"I see what they‚Äôre trying to do, but out of all the ops I do feel it‚Äôs the weakest"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MysticJohn,Really anticlimactic opening.Liked the ending way more
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Le_Ri,too many cgi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Gensi_Alaria,"The animation looks fine, but...

&#x200B;

I miss WIT. There's no charm here. It's all just ""manga adaptation"". No creative depth or characteristic directing style. Even the OST was uninspired - just the trailer music. Not gonna judge the studio until the season ends, but this was lackluster. 

Also, kinda can't stand the line art they use. Titan CGI looks good, funnily enough. Which was not the case with WIT."
Gensi_Alaria,changbinie,"I get your point, but it was right for wit to not animate this season and we're all glad they didn't. Their production had no how to work on what the adaptation needs on the final parts"
Gensi_Alaria,AlloyCel,I think they're saving their budget
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SteveStacks,Titans look amazing.
SteveStacks,Final-Solid,"Armored, Cart and Jaws look fantastic. MONKE is good but not on the level of the other 3."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,depressome,"I'm still disappointed that they didn't make a Marleyan national anthem for the OP in the same vein as the patriotic anthem for Eldia that was OP 2 (the second one for the first season). Oh well, you can't have everything. But it would've been fucking perfect and very fitting, given the current situation in the story."
depressome,speedreedy5566,"It won‚Äôt focus only on Marley though, that will last for a few episodes."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Keres513,"I have not seen the episode yet as I'll watch it later tonight but I took a peek after seeing that there was CGI and I'm a bit disappointed.

Sure the Armored and Beast titans looks good but they are really really inferior to their protrayal by WIT imo, when Reiner was just jumping around destroying the canon I thought it was pretty awkward. I don't really know how to say it but to me it makes me lose their ""weight"" in a sense, kinda na Uncanny Valley feeling but it's more like how the Colossal was portrayed as a mountain of power in 2D but was feeling like it was an inflated balloon in CG.

The mindless titans I saw weren't CG I think so I would have preferred the other way around, mindless in CG and Shifters in 2D.

I haven't seen the full episode and It's only the first one so I won't judge the new season based on that alone tho as everything else I saw was great. I just hope the shifters won't always be full CG...

PS : The OP is fire tho"
Keres513,lawncorazon,"Same thoughts about Reiner, WIT sort of perfected how to portray the heaviness and impact brought upon by every blow coming from the Armored Titan (and titans in general), it's what solidified the first episodes of the first season as iconic and powerful."
lawncorazon,Keres513,"Exactly, plus they just look way less organic than before which was one of the biggest strength of the concept imo"
Keres513,Xen58,"Agreed. My issue with the CG shifters isn't how they look, it's how they move. They feel so human and so nimble... Reiner waving was just the cherry on top. CG moments I thought were especially weird were when Reiner transformed and was flopping around in the air, when Zeke's beast fell to the ground, and when Reiner was running around knocking all the guns off the walls. Doesn't ruin my enjoyment of the season in the slightest but overall the shifters stick out as looking worse than everything around them IMO."
Xen58,Keres513,"Same those were the most jarring moments to me too.

And while I will also enjoy this season and I hope I'll love it as much as the previous ones, once it'll be finished the first thing I'll think about when I'll want to rewatch some AoT is that if I want to see cool titans doing cool things then I'll immediatly put this season aside. So I really hope it'll get better."
Keres513,Killcode2,"tbh it's not 2016 anymore where people automatically assume cg=bad, after houseki no kuni, beastars and dorohedoro people are starting to realize nice-looking cg exists, and this was definitely good cg, I cringe at season 3 colossal cg, honestly I'm suprised people aren't surprised by how good the cg turned out and instead is pretending like they didn't know there was gonna be cg"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Truthgamer2,Can someone share their funimation account with me for the first ep?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,wait this wasnt im the manga right?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Raviolla,THE ED IS BEAUTIFUL
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sedjin,It was good CGI but sadly it's still CGI.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Redditor_From_Italy,"This was great. The animation is good, maybe a smidge below WIT's but I wouldn't call it a step down. Characters look great IMO. CG is noticeable but doesn't stick out like a sore thumb (looking at you WIT Colossal)"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dicecop,"The music really did it for me. But CGI is still CGI, granted it's some of the best CGI I have seen. There were just some moments like Reiner waving etc. that were too ""smooth"". Good CGI is when it limits itself to static objects or makes the movements more ""choppy"" to look like it was drawn. Otherwise you will quickly detect that it's CG"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,merigemini,"I liked it but honestly said, they didn't do a good job with the Beast Titan, he didn't look great.

Also, I liked the ending theme song more than the opening."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YodelingShrimp,Wait it's out?! It doesn't show up on funimation or crunchroll
YodelingShrimp,alilos,not yet
YodelingShrimp,noraeffingdurst,"We have to wait another 4ish hours for subs, apparently. Anyone know why they're so delayed compared to previous years?"
YodelingShrimp,Hussor,It aired on Japanese TV and the raw is out.
Hussor,YodelingShrimp,"Ya, unfortunately for me i don't understand Japanese ;-;"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RiYaZeD,pog episode
RiYaZeD,lol_hey_its_me,Lmfao
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Darnise,"Amazing episode. It's so great to finnaly hear all characters and see them moving! The ost is great too :D and I'm starting to dig the intro.

CG titans will be sth to get used to but i can't complain. I'm thankfull we got the anime at all :D"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ImAFailure2electricb,"How are people seeing it, it doesn‚Äôt come out for another 20 mins"
ImAFailure2electricb,Vihurah,it doesnt? came out like 4 hours ago on japanese tv. i just used the manga as subs
Vihurah,ImAFailure2electricb,Oh that makes sense actually. Hasn‚Äôt come out yet in Crunchyroll or funimation so I was curious
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Everdale,Episode is up on Nyaa if anyone's interested.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zigludo-sama,"I think they did an admirable job with the CGI, but it just ain't doing it for me :\[ I loved the majority of the episode, though, and I'm prepared to be impressed with what comes next.

I do think it was odd that they cut Gabi's line wishing for Reiner to be careful when he transforms, seeing as it helps set up the bond he has with the warrior cadets, but overall it was very true to the source material!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,xoexypnoxo,Guys where can you see it for free
xoexypnoxo,zaque_wann,Subsplease
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HappyBroody,"How many countries/other nations beside MArley/Paradise Island/Mid east allied forces?

Also, I don't get why the Eldians don't revolt against their Marley oppressors.. Especially since they have titan powers."
HappyBroody,ragnaroksoon,fear. no one wants to be the first
HappyBroody,RiYaZeD,hizuru
HappyBroody,Everdale,"Well, technically that's exactly what Zeke's been trying to do all his life. Just not as overtly."
HappyBroody,changbinie,"It's because the eldians that were left in Marley were brainwashed by the marleyan government. Making they think that if they do one step against them they are devils. And if they oppose them it means that they act like that because they have ""devil blood"". Making them live in regrets for being born like that, as an eldian who can turn into titan and bring chaos as once Eldia did.

That's the way marleyans convinced everyone that  the people we know from paradis are all devils."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,blendorana,i know  it looks more like manga but  i didn't like the shadows in their eyes old style was better in my opinion
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Putanegginyourshoe,"Just watched the episode and holy shit.. It's fine if you like Gabi and all, but how does she justify wanting to destroy Paradis when they're isolated and peaceful? It's been so long since I read that chapter, seeing it animated invoked old feelings of spite against her lol."
Putanegginyourshoe,Calebram123,I‚Äôm guessing she is trying to justify herself by saying that they are the reason she is treated like crap on Marley (so she ‚Äúhas to‚Äù supposedly try and destroy them). But I‚Äôm not really sure how she was gonna pull that off (especially after her change of heart in the manga later on).
Calebram123,Putanegginyourshoe,"Yeah I have no idea how she was going to manage it. I suppose the logic just confuses me. Marley says *all* Eldians are evil because they devoured their innocent ancestors. Even if Gabi destroyed the island of devils, that would not prove that the interned Eldians are ""good"". 

But, she is just a kid so I guess it shouldn't be expected for her to think too deeply about things."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Malicake,Imma be honest....I am not fucking with the OP. Hope they make a 2nd one mid season.. Great episode. I like the added suicide bombers and more jaw and cart screen time. The scream tranform titans scene was doope. Jean cameo at the end there. I was actually expecting a Connie one as he actually infiltrated their ranks. Im soo excited to see the festival come to life! Its  gonna be maddening and cool to see gabi's realizations over time. Soo many cool and damn :( moments are coming.
Malicake,Truthgamer2,"OP‚Äôs okay-ish, the ED slaps so hard"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MMD_933_,The opening was extremely disappointing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,3darkdragons,"ED was alright, nothing special to me. OP is weird af lol, I always think an op should keep the vibe of the series while simultaneously differentiating the vibe of the arc/season. This one was pretty good with the season's vibe but completely missed the mark on feeling ""AOT"". Maybe cuz no linked horizion, maybe Cuz the intro look is also really different stylistically. Either way, not one of the better openings, definitely in the bottom half."
3darkdragons,FodderFries,I mean the entirety of post time skips feels like a different story altogether. The vibes its giving us is saying this isn't a story about titans but the horror of war and humanity.
3darkdragons,Zybloks,Well there's time skip and also all of our favourite Paradis demons are missing from it too so it'd feel like a spin off set in the same world for now.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dhtikna,"OP music was amazing but I didnt like the visuals, didnt feel like AoT except for the last frames"
dhtikna,HistoriaTheFirst,"They honestly could‚Äôve and should‚Äôve done more for it. Not everything is a spoiler; even shots of Gabi or the other warriors featured in episode 1 would‚Äôve sufficed. But other than the repetition of clouds, I loved it."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,axfyk,"The animation is good, it's beautiful. but they should've make titan shifter 2d instead and it will be better than previous seasons."
axfyk,bitcheslovedroids,"I mean given the shit they're gonna have to animate later, I think I'll give them a pass"
benjwilliams98,EldianTitanShifter,"Armor and Beast Titan definitely looks too cartoony, their CGI was really bad. 

The Jaw and Cart were fine, but Porco looks a lot worse than he did in the Manga. Manga Jaws Titan was awesome, but the Anime here... his face looks so flat and the proportions are off. His Jaws don't look as cool as I'd hope. Cgi Pure Titans I can live with, and the special transformation effects were well done with the lightning.


But I feel they used too much CGI in general for this episode. Some of it was fine and well done, but there were definitely key moments where it seemd silly. Hope it improves as then goes on, which I have faith it will."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Not_A_Hate_Sub,"I'm gonna be brutally honest, the CG is pretty rough.
I think a lot of the shows impact is gone with CG shifters, like the fights look like they have no weight.
If Warhammer titan fight and stuff is CGI it just ruined s the fight for me, but everybody disagrees?
This art direction is almost show ruining imho, am I alone here?"
Not_A_Hate_Sub,rowanrawr,"You are not alone

I am here with you

Though our opinions are far apart

You are always in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Not_A_Hate_Sub,cooldudeachyut,"The CGI was okay at best, though I believe they will work harder and do Eren vs Warhammer titan justice."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wilzix12,I really hate cgi
wilzix12,cidalkimos,Well go animate for MAPPA!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Harankish,I absolutely LOVE the OP omg. What a great fucking episode.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sinistik,"GABI YOU LITTLE FOXY GIRL, YOU JUST SHOWED US HOW DANGEROUS YOU ARE"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Walrussealy,"So this season may be 16 episodes (DISCLAIMER THAT IS PURE HEARSAY ITS NOT CONFIRMED). So does that mean second part like for S3? Because there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll do it in 16. But if they are doing the 2 part season method, good because they‚Äôre going to need all the time in the world for the last part due to all of the Titans."
Walrussealy,Martin7431,"not saying you're wrong, but do you have a source for 16 episodes? i read yesterday that there are currently no plans for a second half of the season"
Martin7431,Walrussealy,No problem my good sir! [It‚Äôs from our own Survey Corps General H-K_47! The 16 ep info is somewhere further down in his post. But he notes it‚Äôs not official.](https://reddit.com/r/anime/comments/k7qga8/attack_on_titan_season_4_will_be_airing_in_a_few/)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PROBRO2020,"They kinda ruined jaw titan's face, it looked good in the trailer but in anime meh. Honestly I'm scared for future episodes."
PROBRO2020,Zan_tgg,"actually you should be more optimistic for future episodes, they mentioned an interview they were really stressed out at the beginning to handle such a big project, and mappa is a good. Studio so let‚Äôs keep high hopes"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,siebenundsiebzigelf,"after this episode i am glad that the anime is in MAPPA's hands, i believe they will do it justice"
siebenundsiebzigelf,AbadChef,I think their in good hands too but this is the first episode. So I‚Äôm holding back my praise a bit more until further into the season
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IGniToEUW,Please dont tell me that the titans are gonna be cgi all season...
IGniToEUW,vishwas_gajawada,Bruh.. mappa will have to use a LOTT of cg titans in the later part of the season.. so it would be better to get used to cg now.. other wise it will be a wierd transition from 2d to 3d..
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,andrewautopsy,"Episode was great don‚Äôt get me wrong, but besides Reiner and Zeke I just can‚Äôt be bothered to care about these characters. Liberio attack can‚Äôt come soon enough."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tooxnottox,I loved the episode but goddamn that song being looped 3 times in the second half started to get a bit annoying lol
Tooxnottox,Martin7431,"it wasn't looped a single time lol, that was the full song"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Chef--Boyardeee,"Just gone done watching the episode. I'm really not a fan of how the beast titan looks with the cgi, it honestly looks basic to me."
Chef--Boyardeee,Kaiserigen,Its worse when you compare it with the RtS Beast
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NaVENOM,"MY SOLDIERS, RAGE!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoFlavour,LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOO HYPE
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,killinrin,"It doesn't work on Crunchyroll, does anyone know where I can watch it fo' free? If this is against the rules sorry mods, please don't ban me  this is the only thing I have besides the ability to fart on command"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DJ_AW03,Not sure how I feel about the cg. Might have to watch the crunchyroll version to decide
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SteveStacks,Tbh I'll stop watching TV and reading manga when AOT ends.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,noraeffingdurst,"I know the shots of clouds and rain are most likely placeholders that'll be switched out with different content once the season continues and they don't have to worry about spoiling stuff, but it just looks silly currently. Song slaps though."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BabycakesJunior,"Do you think the Blu Ray versions will touch things up? 

Like could they go back and re-do the beast titan, or add to the Jaw titans hair? That would be sick."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DoItNowMikasa,"I liked it overall. Definitely looks choppier/grittier than WIT so far. I don‚Äôt think they cut anything major though and I appreciate that. 

I would have liked a close-up of the drugged up titan suicide bombers to emphasize their complete helplessness, but it was okay.

The scene when Reiner blocks the barrage aimed at Zeke was also sudden and weird. Like 1990s animation and direction quality."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,m33p_meep,All i can say is it was FUCKEN amazing
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,titanslayereren,"I'm willing to let the bad cgi slide and give Mappa another chance if they don't screw up the main parts of the anime. After comparing to WIT studio's version and the S4 trailer, I believe that Mappa are saving budget for the upcoming rumbling and Attack on Marley fight. But if they animate everything badly with cgi then this will be the biggest letdown in anime history. For now, we can only hope that Mappa gives the justice snk truly deserves..."
titanslayereren,UltraPlasma,True. We‚Äôll have to rely on them so much. But we also have to remember that we can‚Äôt blame them much if the anime isn‚Äôt perfect since they are working during a pandemic of all sorts.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thatiskute," Opening is awesome af !  Ending is great too . 
AND PIECK IS SO FUCKING CUTE !"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Naskr,"Absolutely 10/10 episode, can't wait to watch it again."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,_Athgen_,The OP surpassed all of my expectations holy shit it's so good
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LilEscobarz,"I honestly don‚Äôt know how I feel about the CGI titans. It doesn‚Äôt look bad just.....out of place. 
Had hoped not all of the titans would be cgi except for a few like the colossal. Wit definiatly did better on that department."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SyddPink,"Really good episode and it fit a lot in, i don‚Äôt mind the OP just too many explosions and the ending is great. BUT WTF IS THAT CGI?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Zer0gu3,"The CGI wasn‚Äôt bad, and was actually pretty well mixed with the shows darker colors, hazy aesthetic, and artstyle, but it still rubs me the wrong way that they decided to use cgi on the shifters.  We all didn‚Äôt like WITS cgi colloidal, but it‚Äôs understandable given how massive it is.  WIT never used cgi on the smaller titans.  Has same concerned that every shifter will be cg going forward which is not okay."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Boi_just_boi,"I'm so confused, did I watch the right aot season 4? Where was eren and the gang, and why is it like 9 years in the future"
Boi_just_boi,ragnaroksoon,4 years actually. this is happening 4 years after the battle of shiganshina
ragnaroksoon,Boi_just_boi,I'm recapping on season 3 real quick
Boi_just_boi,iQnsecure,it's not 9 years but 4-5 and you saw jean at the end
iQnsecure,Boi_just_boi,"They said something about 9 years ago losing the female and colossal titan, and honestly I haven't read the manga and I'm so confused"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NephilimAura,"Overall, I feel this episode was an above-average re-introduction into the SnK series but overall underwhelming. I have high hopes that episodes to follow will only get better.  
  
I don't like the art style a lot. It's good but I think it's a bit contrasting to how the earlier SnK seasons were drawn. The dirt and ground, the character portraits, and the CGI all are things that stood out to me as things that I don't like a lot and things that I find are a break from the previous art style.  
  
Regarding the CGI: It's average. I wouldn't give it above average or below average. It's stiff and the shadowing isn't perfect but it still fits into the show neatly, to the point where most viewers I'm sure don't look at it as something that stands out from the episode.   
  
That said, I am disappointed that CGI was used, especially when we were handed a trailer that didn't use CGI. Why set up false expectations and lie to the viewers? We all love SnK here and the first episode is going to come out, regardless of what trailer was released. Maybe they ran into some budgeting or other challenges but regardless - I'm one of those ""don't like CGI"" folks.  
  
The CGI looked stiff at times and although it was a step up from the Colossal Titan CGI, it's still not an approach many of us enjoy. I don't like CGI and feel confident that, if the artists took drew things by hand, they would have been able to accomplish good art too. We had an epic Eren-Reiner fights, Eren-Annie fights, and Levi-Zeke fights - mostly drawn by hand, so I don't buy the excuse that ""they wouldn't have been able to pull it off in Marley."" The SnK directors have shown that they are more than capable of pulling of epic fights with hand-drawn illustrations.
  
Moving on:  
  
* Falco dreaming about a bird, waving a sword around is cool but I think unnecessary. It seems like that foreshadowing was just shoved in. There's enough foreshadowing to go around as is, and I hope the direction isn't to shove more foreshadowing like that into character lines because they don't feel there's enough already.  
  
* Gabi blowing up the train was lame. Honestly, are you going to tell me, from an enemy army point-of-view, you're just going to watch an enemy girl crawl up a mountain, without investigating, firing back, or doing anything else aside from gossiping to one another? Especially in war, when people don't exactly act rationally? Sure, I get it - they retaliated with gunfire, but the whole ""let's watch this unknown girl who has something strapped to her leg walk up to a key point of our base, and not do anything"" doesn't seem realistic at all.  
  
* Zeke's intoxicated Titan-bombs(the people in the plane) really didn't feel as big in the Anime than it did in the Manga. They didn't even really looked intoxicated; they looked paralyzed and scared. It felt like, because they were dropped off the plane so quickly, it didn't send a message about war or using civilians as warfare - which I felt was more powerful in the Manga. Even in the trailer, it seemed that scene was going to be given more weight, but it didn't really have it.  
  
Overall, I'm glad SnK is back, but I have high expectations for this season, and higher expectations for future episodes. Many of us were already saying that the new SnK season is going to beat out the other anime for the top spot of highest ratings. I'm still in high hopes for that, but the first episode has dramatically lowered these hopes... especially since the first ep is often supposed to be the one that catches attention.  
   
  
Look forward to watching more!"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,elsvGames,The episode was really good except the cgi titan fight. They changed it so that Rainers arm was blown off for some reason. Its really good cgi but some of the beast and armour shots looked a bit janky. I really hope we get hand drawn titan fights in the upcoming episodes.
elsvGames,UltraPlasma,Yeah. Only two scenes caught me like ‚Äúyo the animation prob needed a work in this one‚Äù. This was the next shot after the titans fell from the sky and the other one was when Zeke landed.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,skyrockkk,OP is terribile imo
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ragnaroksoon,the opening is pretty...meh
ragnaroksoon,5437354724,I am alone.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,lawncorazon,"8/10 or 8.5/10 for me, I'm sure other episodes would be a 10/10."

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MoFlavour,"OK SO I WATCHED THE FIRST HALF.

But I realized it'll be so much better while watching wot subs on crunchyroll"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,gameralam,Is it out yet ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BlacksShallTakeOverr,is it on crunchyroll for us east? if not wat time will it
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Spyer2k,Is this really only 16 episodes long? How will they fit everything
Spyer2k,kaorisloop,A leaker on twt said that this season will only cover up to ch 122
Spyer2k,Hisuthepretty,It's most likely going to be more episodes after these 16. With 16 episodes the anime csn only adapt up to chapter 122. Hopefully some time in the next 6 months or so they will release more episodes for the rest of the manga.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisoka_lover92,Marley deserves nothing but death
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Aki133,"Was this episode in the past or the present compared to the scouts and Eren? Also, I‚Äôm very confused on which side the titans were on and who controlled the fort. Even after watching season 3 I‚Äôm still very confused on who the eldians and marleyans are and how that relates to Eren‚Äôs time period w/ the scouts. Can somebody please explain? Other than that I loved the animation and feel like Mappa is gonna do a great job."
Aki133,zoomziller,"What are you doing on r/titanfolk, you will likely get spoiled.
Venture at your own risk"
Aki133,YonatanShofty,"Buddy this is a manga sub, I highly advise you to not read anything here"

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,zoomziller,"Personally I'm not too fond of a lot of the cable used, hopefully it will grow on me"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,EtienneGarten,"Which subs to use, now that HorribleSubs has done the Marco?"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AmberVeil,"Not a big fan of the cg in action, some indiv frames looked really good but the movement during action seemed very cg-ish. Cant unsee"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaiserigen,"I will watch it and I'm a fan, I really liked seeing Marley animated, but it changed a little too much, CGI titans are super weird, it looks like a different anime"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tacer8,Relax everyone. Turn off your Caps.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,RekklesCami,Let's go Gabi
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mohacas,Final season is in good hands!!! Jaw titan looks insane!
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Crisisofland,PIEIIIIIIIIICK MY WIIIIIIFE OMG
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yoyoa666,Was worried after the rough s4 but the animation (especially the cg) was superb. Hope they can maintain for the rest.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,iluvsnails,PIECK IS SO FKING CUTE
iluvsnails,DoctorCumberbatch,HER ANIMATION IN THE PREVIEW WAS  S M O O T H
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,cegoousado,"Ngl the only part jarring from the CG was the Titan's faces and Reiner's hair, other than that, it was pretty good"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,adi14022322,where is the episode
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Rodranime,How long for Crunchyroll drop?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Sivasta,Where did you watch it?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kingsark,"Was the line ‚Äúweren‚Äôt we just flying around and swinging swords around?‚Äù said by Falco in the manga right after he was saved?

I reread the Marley arc right before watching this episode and remember him saying something that hints at him having memories from the future, but don‚Äôt remember him saying that exact line like he did in this episode."
kingsark,velONIONraptor,Falco never said that at all...
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,deanNoFap,Does anyone know when Dubs are going to drop.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Kaioken64,Is there a release date for English dub or should I just power through and watch the sub?
Kaioken64,BassenLasse,Where do you watch the sub?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ComradeRuskie,Crunchy crashes for me. And Funi doesn‚Äôt show the new episode. >_>
ComradeRuskie,Diet__Infinite,Try Hulu if you can! It works for me! (I live in the U.S.)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LifeLikeClub9,I told my friend how the episode ends and he blocked me and won‚Äôt answer my calls. Any tips?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,urboiwildo425,How many chapters did this cover then? Was it 4?
urboiwildo425,AcceleratorLVL5,Chapters 91 and 92
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,CredibilKS,"I didn‚Äôt understand anything fuck me, who was the guy at the end? Eren? Or someone I shouldn‚Äôt know yet because of spoiler"
CredibilKS,ArgentWolfBlade,"It was Jean, I should warn you this is a manga reader subreddit so I would get out of here if you don't wanna get the plot ruined"
CredibilKS,BigBrainShaf,"Have you read the manga? This is a manga spoilers subreddit and that was Jean, who we‚Äôve seen in the last three seasons"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,princesstafarian,I liked it but I don't think it covered enough since there will only be 16 episodes.
princesstafarian,NotAPeanut_,Where did you see that? It‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been confirmed how many episodes this season has yet
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheLuiz,"yeah, let's tell the audience these informations we already know, it's totally not exposition"
TheLuiz,Everdale,I think the fact that they made Falco lose his memory was a cool way to dump exposition. At least it somewhat makes sense to get him up to speed.
Everdale,TheLuiz,"That's what I call ""exposition excuse"""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,txsxxphxx2,Where docyou guys watch this btw??? I really want to watch it
txsxxphxx2,excrowned,9anime works
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,mononlabe,"From chapter 91 to 135 there are 44 chapters. We know that the first episode covers 2 chapters. This means that there will maybe 44/2=22 episodes covered. Isayama just released the new manga cover, which gives us at least 4 more chapters. This makes the anime covers at total 24 episodes, just like season 1"
AnshT18,Eribitor,Better (jaw and amored Titan) then really bad (season 3 collosal Titan) can still be bad. I will watch the episodes but the fact that it seems like that all the titans will be CGI now is a huge bummer for me
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,raba7khaled,"Cgi... Cgi titan fight scenes this is what i was afraid of, man mappa fooled us with the posters, I'm not optimistic for the rest of the anime thank god i read the manga. Rip snk i guess its 2020 after all..."
raba7khaled,berketozlu,Bruh
berketozlu,raba7khaled,"Something is wrong with you man if you found those action sequences good, just coming from s3 part 2, i can tell u clearly aot soul is being killed rn and so is mine"
raba7khaled,evascale,"You will get downvoted to hell, but you are true. I'm sure even people who say this episode was a banger deep down know that WIT did a much better job, but they are lying to themselves. 

Free yourself, people. Be like Eren. Admit the episode looked like crap with wonky CGI. Just do it."
evascale,raba7khaled,"My heart is broken man I've read the manga, but watching the anime always felt different.   I was like a dog who ate a raw piece of meat and loved it, then ate a well cooked steak afterwards and realized how much more delicious it is. That's how WIT's adaptation felt like. This ep felt like eating a shoe...
My day is ruined and my heart is broken"
evascale,cellulair,"Everything Mappa does is ... okay, it's passable but it's so easy to see how WIT could have done it better. It's so difficult to watch and not compare to WIT, and honestly how could you not? 

At everything I go ""Oh that's pretty good... but WIT would've done it better."""
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ohayo1o,"Fucking CGI better then usual but still worse than in WIT, it ruined it for me ngl"
ohayo1o,aph223,"i thought Wit's Colossal was pretty horrendous but i didnt mind by the end of S3P2. its about the story for me. Besides, I think the only one that i didn't like was the Beast. The Armor was ok, and I thought that the Jaw and Cart were good."
aph223,Vecus,"Idk, there were some shots of Bert that were hard to look at. Like when he was spreading fire over the Shiganshina District"
ohayo1o,Everdale,I think they need to mix in some 2D parts too. Mainly for the stills. The movement-heavy scenes can be 3D but it'd be a nice balance to have 2D close up stills like WIT used to do.
Everdale,Enternade,"I'm pretty sure that some of the still shots were actually 2D but don't take my word for it, but the scene of the armored titan right after transforming and falling to the ground seems like it's 2D"
ohayo1o,iHaveTime16,"It didnt ruin it, it just left me feeling disappointed that EVERY Shifter scene was CGI like damn

edit: I still loved the episode, and the CGI look pretty good for cgi"
ohayo1o,HistoriaIsTheMother,Agreed
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,"Where are all the people that were like ‚ÄúI trust Mappa‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe are so lucky to have them, it already looks amazing‚Äù.

All you guys that were riding their dick got humbled today. The way people were disrespecting WiT was mind blowing. This is what you guys get."
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,safinhh,"how did they disrespect  wit by showing optimism for mappa

and nobody got humbled today

chill tf down"
safinhh,Killcode2,"this guy is talking like berserk 2016 happened, meanwhile I saw the actual episode and the production quality is (in my opinion) the best it's ever been, also cg armored makes me think mappa can do the ancient titans onslaught without making it look like wit's clunkier colossal titan cg, honestly everything met my expectations today, and even surpassed it in some"
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Lekaetos,"Nobody got humbled and nobody disrespected WIT

What are you on about ? Drink some water"
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Jungle_Fiddle,Hey chill out dude we're all friends here
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Amputee_Kun,"mappas animation looks much better than wits imo, but people like you fail to understand that people have preferences"
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,moving_asunder,"Imagine getting this angry because people like something you don‚Äôt, seethe harder lmao"
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,alucidexit,">All you guys that were riding their dick got humbled today.

Actually no!"
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,ragnaroksoon,"WIT's characters design were more similar to the manga, their art direction is better too. I think that WIT is more suitable, but their CGI sucks and since they are a small studio, I think they couldn't afford to contract a CGI studio like mappa did"
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Anniemal_Nitrate,Jesus christ.
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,Clemenx00,I don't simp for any of the studios but I am pretty happy with the episode my dude
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Thadrious,"I'm gonna say it. This season is doomed. The titan CGI is not terrible not nearly as good as how WIT drew the Titans. Zeke and Reiner looked awful. Giving me Bezerk vibes. 

All the big fight scenes are gonna look so so so bad. Especially when Eren transforms to kill Willy, if he's CGI that's gonna make me vomit. RIP final season"
Thadrious,eoeden,"It looks god awful, and both you and I are gonna get drowned in downvotes for saying it."
eoeden,Thadrious,"Ikr. People are desperate to justify everything in this season as good. But the titan CGI can't be justified, its so trash"
Thadrious,kingsark,"calm down, it‚Äôs the first episode. And CG colossal didn‚Äôt ruin anything in season 3 part 2.

Plus there were loads of things that were adapted amazingly this episode."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Anthonyvaz03,probably the most boring and random opening ive ever seen. it didn't even show a character just randome smoke and colorful explosions i dont understand what they were aiming for with that.
Anthonyvaz03,FruitJuicante,"To me, it was great, because, one, it gave a statement ""We are MAPPA, not WIT.""  
And two, I mean, there are crows falling like in 131, you can see Eren's spine, Eren's AT at the end is extremely menacing, and it kind of shows ""This is War.""  


Like, it ties the story into the real world. To me, it's a great way to show what the season is about without spoilers and showing all the characters flipping about and showin' dey ass etc."
Anthonyvaz03,NaughtySl0th,"I think they didn't want to show many characters because it would have spoiled reveals that happened in the first episode and will happen later on. Looks like they're trying to depict the brutality and destructiveness of war, which I think is a good theme for this arc. It was kind of boring though, just a lot of empty shots and shots of explosions. I loved the quick glimpse of the Attack Titan at the end though."
Anthonyvaz03,Ilooklikea15yearold,"Almost like that was the entire point, war isnt some fun shonen anime bad guys vs good guys"
Anthonyvaz03,Amature_Specialist,It‚Äôll probably be like ED 3 when we start realizing it‚Äôs some how a shit ton of spoilers hidden in there
Amature_Specialist,European_Badger,"A lot of people have also been saying that it seems likely that as the season goes on, they'll remove more and more smoke from the OP, showing more details."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DontTouchMyFeces,Berserk 2016 tier CGI. Well played Mappa
DontTouchMyFeces,AcceleratorLVL5,"I mean, I *definitely* have my criticisms about the CGI but if you think it's Berserk 2016 tier you might want to go rewatch that. Until I see Eren clip out of his titan like Guts' cannon clipped out of his armor, I doubt it'll get that bad.

(Please don't actually follow that advice. I would not willingly put you through that suffering.)"
kage_7,Reiax_ksa,I completely agree this is not a hype to 1000 linked horizon season. Part 1 is just gloomy and depressing which the song completely fits.
kage_7,cidalkimos,Agreed.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Levi_PigPiss,"Oh dear lord. I just watched the op to see what everyone was talking about. I would definitely never recommend it to any anime-only in order not to throw them off.

This always happens when it is not LH. I will never understand why they just don't get them back if they are actually fans of the series and I am sure that Revo is always willing to write new AOT songs."
Levi_PigPiss,relativokay,It was Linked Horizon's own choice to depart from the series.
relativokay,Levi_PigPiss,Oh really?! Never heard of that but if that's the case then I guess we dont have a choice.
Levi_PigPiss,SausageGuzzler69,Name checks out
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Tacer8,Why is everyone so crazy hyped? It‚Äôs literally just drawings in fast motion. We‚Äôve already read the manga.
Tacer8,tastypesto,Because it's drawings in fast motion *with sounds*
tastypesto,Raviolla,bombastic sounds at that
Tacer8,tastypesto,Because it's drawings in fast motion *with sounds*
Tacer8,vicrom14,good joke
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Ahmed_Umar,I can't believe that they showed Mikasa in the end there.
Ahmed_Umar,Sometimes1Wonder,That was the cart titan xD
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,vendaaiccultist,I‚Äôm sorry but that intro was....
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Postmade,I hate the cgi. With hand drawn you can exaggerate the motion and make it look way cooler. I thought the cgi looked out of place and clunky. Why did they do it like that?
Postmade,gabrielyvb,There‚Äôs gonna be so much action this season. It would be so difficult to hand drawn all of it. Hopefully the later fights might have some hand drawn sequences tho üôèüèª
gabrielyvb,Postmade,Okay just rewatched it a couple times. It‚Äôs much better than I thought it‚Äôs really not that bad. Just a few bad cgi scenes which I‚Äôm sure they could touch up later right?
gabrielyvb,Postmade,I know but Still. Just take your time and do it right. Attack on titan has always taken their time and now their gonna rush the final season?! What is wrong with them do the show justice don‚Äôt rush it to get it out.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisoka_lover92,Slavery has begun

CrystalAbyss,exozaln,Minifreeza? I was there :)
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yosrii12,is the subbed episode out yet ?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Runiic_,I need a high-quality shot of Ymir in the ED
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mahali2020,Its out on hulu right now. Its amazing but the cgi was trash
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,po-tato45,When‚Äôs the English dub?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ehcmier,Manga?  Or the animated adaption?
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PinParticular,I haven't watched the episode yet. Only opening and ending. Given recent events in the manga if Falco ends up defeating Eren I'll be disappointed. Just felt pretty heavy foreshadowing but hope I'm wrong
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,WiT Studio > Mappa
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,BenardoDiShaprio,ehh idk the entirety of the rts battle made me dissapointed in WIT so now I have high hopes for MAPPA
Eren_Jaeger_The_Goat,ragnaroksoon,[they did good in the trailer](https://i.imgur.com/MjUYImA.jpg). sad that they needed to change it.
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,depressome,"I haven't seen the episode (I can't for the moment), only some clips on YouTube and both the OP (which I don't like) and the ED (which I like), doesn't seem bad so far but the CGI is really noticeable I must say, especially on Zeke's and Galliard's Titans. Jean instead is perfect as always."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,dictatormateo,animation got lot worse
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Icy-Distribution-816,"LOVED IT. Man, Gabi is s√≥ ugly, lol"
Icy-Distribution-816,KingKehmi,hate her so much
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,theMdood,"I hope the CGI gets better in the next episodes or gets removed completely, it looks weird except for the jaw titan."
theMdood,Evan_Is_Here,"Yeah, a lot of people have been saying they don't like the Jaw titan but personally I think the Jaw titan looks best."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I_ama_Borat,"Other than the bad OP and closing theme, this was amazing. Wish they‚Äôd relax with the 3D on the Titans but it still looked really good."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Shikagi_,"Maaan the titans looks so shit, i hope ill get used to it"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,maxo3D,"IDK, I have a mixed feelings about this season. 
It's completely different...
I'd say I more dislike this whole thing...
Horrible intro/outro...
Thank you WIT studio, for first seasons, and damn you for not finishing whole AoT"
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Charliefromlost,Is attack on titan still progressing? I thought the show had ended already :O
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,yonkojiri1,"It felt like mappa got overwhelmed, in a simple fight scene they made everything 3D, and played the same song on repeat 3 times. I don't think season 4 should've been put in the hands of a studio that's biggest production is Yuri On Ice."
yonkojiri1,GioMike,"if you pay attention, the soundtrack plays its full length. it doesnt get repeated."
yonkojiri1,Martin7431,"the 3D is fine with me. it's certainly not perfect, but it's better than most CGI in anime. 

also, the song wasn't played on repeat. it was just the full song. it did go on for a pretty long time, and i felt like there should've been cuts but then again the fight was pretty long too"
yonkojiri1,Zedeed,"To be fair it didn't get put on MAPPA no one else wanted it, rather MAPPA do it than it be cancelled and the 3D was good imo with the exception of Zeke but even thats fixable."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisoka_lover92,Gabi is annoying asf

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,LifeLikeClub9,Trash show. This season is the reason i will never finish this show. Terrible episode so far. Smh
LifeLikeClub9,Clemenx00,gr8 b8 m8
LifeLikeClub9,Barnacle23,get this man a ban
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Uschak,"Should not watched this. I am noooooooot fan of changing the studios. Look what have they did with fairy tail :/... No emotions in their faces. Gabi looks like she went to a bottox before the casting and Falco looks like an old dude suffering with Achondroplasia.

Only reiner is sexy. 
Jean at the end was nice into."
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AsterTheBastard,To be honest. Idk how much I want to watch past the end of episode 59. The series gets really dumb? Idk how else to put it. After they drive the beast titan out of the island. I've read all but the last 3 chapters of the Manga. Not much of a fan anymore. Otherwise the episode was fine.

emmyeggo,avengers9,"Great Post. Honestly would enjoy this ending a lot.

avengers9,emmyeggo,"Thanks for pointing that out! Additionally, I think in a recent interview he also said the ending was similarly inspired by both Muv Luv and Jurassic Park; and in Jurassic Park, an entire **island** of Dinos is destroyed (bar the few who survive). Also ties in nicely w this theory!"

_somewhat_damaged,21stcenturyschizoidf,This is why I love reading past threads when the new chapters come out.
emmyeggo,BudgetTranslator,"However great this sounds I can't help but feel it would greatly cheapen the ending as the solution would be leaving the aot world behind to solve the problem instead of solving it in-universe. To put it simply, it's no different then ""Oh, that was all a dream. Nevermind.""."
BudgetTranslator,emmyeggo,"That's true, which is why I believe Isayama said he will 'betray' the reader. However, I don't think this ending is necessarily the same as the classic 'oh, it was all a dream.' The universe of destruction (what we see in Attack on Titan) is still very real and exists - it's just that Eren and most probably the other significant characters seen in the School Castes will transport back (however, presumably time has passed, though this is still up for debate).

There's also evidence to suggest that Mikasa might once again resist the memory wipes (and will be able to remember everything that transpired). I also have an additional \[crackpot\] theory that Armin may sacrifice himself and stay behind in this current world; which is why he is foreshadowed as the 'last man standing.' This would strengthen the bond between the two universes in question, as they're not necessarily fake or 'just a dream.'"
emmyeggo,younghnam,"This would make the ending more palatable if the universes were tied together like this. There‚Äôs got to be consequences for what Eren has done... just returning to an alternative universe to escape all the pain and hard questions would be disappointing, and would de facto feel like ‚Äúwaking up from a dream‚Äù ending. 

Side question: what‚Äôs the connection to Ymir? How and why was she able to reach Eren in an alternate universe? Does Paths cut across universes?"
emmyeggo,Still_Perspective247,"(Ik you said crackpot theory *BUT* hear me out) 

This may sound dumb given the fact that I have no idea how going back the original universe works, so please be kind - but wouldn't it be interesting if the  characters were given the choice of whether they want to leave or not?

If OP's theory is correct, Eren has been working hard to fulfill his promise of killing everyone (which is what's likely going to end their deal and let him go back) so that he *AND* his friends that he so deeply loves can go back ""home"". 

But what if they don't want to?

I imagine that if they (they being Armin, Jean and Connie...I'm not sure where Mikasa stands in this respect) were to find out about how all this was the result of Eren's wish out of boredom and that the AOT universe would still exist once they left, them being the Scouts, wouldn't go with him. Or at the very least, it would be painful for them to. 

I love this theory, but I think it would also be interesting to see them given the choice to leave or stay and be distraught about choosing the easier side of leaving and forgetting, rather than them just disappearing into the orig universe like in muv luv. 

Imagine the heart-wrenching drama! If they leave, they don't have to remember the pain. They get to see Sasha, Marco - their families and friends, alive and well. 

But this also means that all these people in the post rumbling world will continue to exist and bear the consequences of their actions. It would align w most of their character arcs to stay, and even be consistent with the recent character deaths; they'd all give up on their dreams and die. Jean wanted the opportunity to have a happy family, live in comfort; Armin too because then he'd be giving up on his dreams and dying since he doesn't get to see that other world lol; Connie doesn't get to see his family again; this could even conclude Mikasa's arc (mind you, I'm aware I'm slightly biased, if only because I'd be more satisfied in the gut-punch kind of ending where Mikasa lets Eren go rather than them ending up together, so take this w a grain of salt) where she lets go of Eren and doesn't get to stay by his side forever *and* it's her own choice (i'm here for Pain). This discussion could even be part of that final EMA confrontation we're all waiting for! 

It's a very Those Who Walk Away From Omelas kind of moral dilemma and tbh that'd make up for the ""and it was all a dream"" effect of suddenly making a different universe. 

The ending where they all choose to stay can also align with the ANR video, since Eren seems to be the only one to make the transition to the orig universe and he seems to be mourning his friends back in universe 2 (as interpreted by OP) 

I haven't worked this out fully but j some food for thought. I'd also be interested in seeing if anyone can figure out how the Marleyan warriors fit into this theory or anything else that I've missed!"
emmyeggo,LunaNogood,"That would make sense if armin stay, cause of his backstory that he never runaway."
emmyeggo,donuter454,"> I also have an additional [crackpot] theory that Armin may sacrifice himself and stay behind in this current world; which is why he is foreshadowed as the 'last man standing.'

I know you call it a crackpot theory, but have you written a post about this anywhere? I'd love to read it based on how much this post has convinced me.

If it's true that Armin is the only one who doesn't return to the School Caste universe, then that may explain why Armin is the story's narrator (which we know thanks to the anime). If the rest of the cast returns to SCU then of course Armin would be the one who's recounting the tale of Attack on Titan, because he'd be the only person left in that universe who could even tell it."
BudgetTranslator,Faulky1x,tbh this could all lead into attack on school castes being turned into an anime if it hasnt already as kind of a Sequel to attack on titan seeing as how popular AOT has become it would kinda be a waste to leave it while its hot maybe that was what Isayama was going for
emmyeggo,gippalippa,"I honestly think it's an impressive job, and the theory actually makes sense, but the idea that everything we've experienced is the result of a bored kid's desire is truly alienating.

In addition, it would distort the context of the entire story for the second time:

Survival-horror story set in a post-apocalyptic medieval setting, with the scientific mystery of the titan (we all thought the titans were some kind of experiment gone wrong)

&#x200B;

War Drama about the human nature set in a 20th century world with a mystic element

&#x200B;

A fantastical monkey's paw type of story about parallel universes, which revolves around a boy's desire to destroy the world out of boredom.

Mind fucking blown, if it really goes like this (which I don't think, to be honest) I think everyone will lose their minds, it would be a legendary shitshow to watch."
gippalippa,thot_buster04,"I don't think the fact that erens wish to create a world is dumb,have you ever not wished to be in an anime world? because this world is quite boring"

gippalippa,MakoShark93,"Actually, I don't think its really all that ""alienating"" if this was born out of bored kid's desire. Think about it. We are all escaping our boredom right now. Each and everyone of us. Everytime we read works of fiction like this, our minds travel to an alternate world where momentarily we forget about everyday trivialties/reality. The theory is meta as fuck and even doubly meta for Isayama who created it. If this is the truth then it is a statement on life itself."
emmyeggo,ssjgsskkx20,This coild be a epilogue chapter like in demon slayer. Where they all are reborn in modern world.
emmyeggo,Administrative_Leg34,"This totally makes sense! Specially with 'MY WAR' Lyrics

I believe that the girl part is Mikasa and it is about her death. Here's my analysis:

*""I lost my way home. Evening upside down""*

-We all know Eren is Mikasa's ""family"", plus when they first met, Eren invited her back ""home""
- ""Evening upside down"" means she was not on Eren's side

*""With a chime that starts crying, Gradually falling down""*

-In reference with chapter 1, where eren woke up to Mikasa crying.
-""Chime"" is the sound of the leaves, and armin and zeke arc showed what it means to the friend trio.

*""You said you wouldn't let me finish my journey home, its okay to cry, just for now""*
-This  will be Eren killing Mikasa, and Mikasa telling him, its alright we're gonna see each othet again. Thus Mikasa's firshadowing in chapter 1, when eren heard ""see you later"".

*""What is happening along the railroad tracks? How will it bloom again next year?""*

-The railroad, was in reference to the scene where Eren and Mikasa was blushing in front of each other in chapter 108. This symbolizes their romantic feelings for each other, and if they would feel the same the ""next time"" they meet.
-Note that Mikasa is the ""flower"". The purple flower references in the anime, always appear in EreMika moments.

*""If the water is too hot, it will be too cold, If you're feeling drained, open the door to the night""*

-This is like Mikasa saying, if you miss me, you can visit me (through memories)
-""Open the door to the night"" symbolizes the ""paths""

*""You said you would not let me finish alone. Its okay to cry just for now""*

-This is like saying ""You promised to wrap that scarf around me (protect me) but you broke your promise.""

*""There's always tomorrow's lesson anyway,""*

-""You can always change it""

*""... I have to finish my homework and go to bed""*
- ""For now, I finished my duty (as a scout)... and die""

I've always entertained many ending theories. But idk.. the timeloop os getting stronger to me these days"
emmyeggo,Dr___Bright,"This is not the betrayal I was hoping for. It‚Äôs be shocking tho, definitely. A writer going out of their way to leave the reader unsatisfied? It‚Äôs unheard off. 

Guess all we can do is to wait and see"
Hussor,Metbert,"To be fair, while I can see why people would feel that way.

I do not think that all the events, relationships, characters and questions that the series gave us up to this point will be all for nothing... 

I mean, the world of AOT itself is not real, it's fiction, it's created y Isayama, it does ""not exist"" and yet does and we all still love it.

Is there that even much of a difference? It's just one more layer of ""fiction""..."
MuazSyamil,Joet2386,Maybe that would be okay.
emmyeggo,snackinglettuce,what a long read! i think this theory is interesting but im fine with how aot ends no matter what tbh. i guess this could happen judging on the evidence.
snackinglettuce,theeburneruc,"Yeah honestly, I've enjoyed the journey enough to not be bothered by how it ends. The saying, 'all good things must come to an end' echoes loudly here, but it surprisingly doesn't bother me,"
emmyeggo,kiddfrommars,Man if this ends up being the ending I'm gonna be happy as fuck
emmyeggo,gr_ae_y,"Haven't read the Q&A part yet but got a doubt, couldn't the Mikasa Lost Girls OVA be somehow related to this ""Alternate Universes born from a wish"" theory? I know, it wasn't an Ymir Powered Alternate Universe (Pending Patent) probably, but it also involves an alternate universe while the person is sleeping...

Edit: She even got energies to keep moving forward after that... Maybe related to that memory wipe immunity?"
gr_ae_y,emmyeggo,"I haven't seen this OVA, but I'll definitely give it a watch - thanks for pointing it out!   


I do know however, that there's symbolism in the early chapters of the manga with Mikasa and a butterfly when she says 'I've seen this countless times before,' and in the OVA apparently there's similar symbolism with a blue butterfly (which is usually a nod to the butterfly effect). Definitely interesting stuff!"
emmyeggo,gr_ae_y,"Well yes, for this theory to get really solid is needed to take some symbolism literally and to take some other random phrases as symbolism... but that doesn't mean that we can't love it!  


Also, if there's no animated adaptation incoming for the HS AU shorts I hardly see this happening, given that even between manga readers not everyone is aware of their existence and not everyone that is has read them, it probably wouldn't be just surprising for the viewers... It may be absolutely out of place, I think.  


Still looking forward to how the AU is going to relate to the main series!"
gr_ae_y,Extreme_Supermarket7,Completely agree with you!!
emmyeggo,Parzival_32,i see potential... (awesome read btw)
emmyeggo,fessvssvm,"This is so batshit that I actually love it. Granted, many things can subjectively be considered evidence for one theory or another, but I could see this happening without it being completely 'out of the blue' based on the material you present in support of this. I admittedly don't know how I'd feel if this were the ending for the series, but I have to admit, it *would* be a shocker and seem like an out-of-left-field twist.

Also, kudos to you for all the time invested. If I had money I'd gold you."

emmyeggo,LinkinShriya,"Props to you for coming up with this amazing perspective! I really hope this becomes true, fans really are tormented at this point and really deserve a satisfying ending."
emmyeggo,no_one_just_a_ghost,"Have you watched the OVA of Mikasa ""Lost in the cruel world"". There she experiences some kind of alternate timeline where eren dies in a hot air ballon."
emmyeggo,yaujj36,"Then Karl Fritz word to Kenny make sense, ""In the not too distant future, this world will crumble, it is my wish to built a brief paradise."" That means Karl Fritz knew this world will be destroyed and before he disappeared, he wanted to live in peace before a suppose annihilation of the AoT world."
emmyeggo,jrvbwr34bhcmdl,"I want to say that this is highly unlikely since the anime has no AU at all but it's possible that the anime with have it's own ending. 

Though if this does happen, I do hope that Isayama pulls it off well. I don't care about plot decisions, that is up to the author, it is only proper execution that matters

Whether this does happen or not it's a good theory, I want to have a hard time believing this but all your research really connects the facts. This is tangential but I do wish that non-English reading authors (mangakas basically lol) would be more connected to their foreign fanbase because of the effort they put into theories like these, even the joke ones (looking at you Madagascar)"
jrvbwr34bhcmdl,emmyeggo,"That's true, and I have been similarly confused as to how the anime will go about it (if this theory is correct). Perhaps this is why the animation studio has seemingly only committed to a part 1 so far? 

That being said, it could still work in the anime; as seen above, most of the evidence for the alternate universe didn't actually come from the School Caste previews, but from clues in the anime/manga itself. It just may not be as effective for the anime only's (but perhaps that's why extra clues have been added in - such as the Tybur children in the school uniform)."
emmyeggo,3darkdragons,"I would agree, if we saw any mention of the fake previews in the anime. I think it's possible that the au is cannon but not the true ending, or not cannon and just cool and cohesive, hence isayama saying it'd link to the main story. Either way, good work on the theory!

Could you please link me to the previews? I've never seen all of them."
3darkdragons,Kerim44,[Got you bud](https://imgur.com/a/rP8Skzr)
3darkdragons,emmyeggo,"That's a good point. However, it still wouldn't explain the memory shard of Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin. Considering Isayama's effective use of symbolism and foreshadowing, I really doubt he'd be chucking that in for the hell of it. 

And yeah, though this could definitely work in the manga, I am not sure how it would work in the anime. Potentially this is why only 'part 1' is being animated so far? I always thought it was strange that the animation studio didn't just wait a few more months for the manga to finish and then adapt everything in the one go. 

That being said, it could still work in the anime; as seen above, most of the evidence for the alternate universe didn't actually come from the School Caste previews, but from clues in the anime/manga itself. It just may not be as effective for the anime only's (but perhaps that's why extra clues have been added in - such as the Tybur children in the school uniform)."
emmyeggo,3darkdragons,"Perhaps! I still feel it may be a bit of a stretch, however writing it off would be wrong as it is indeed plausible. Guess we'll just have to wait and see!"
LunaNogood,Nufulini,    It was an isekai all along
emmyeggo,invaderzz,"I've theorized with my friend about this as well, but obviously not as in depth as you. I agree that it's definitely possible and there's a pretty good chance it will happen.

Isayama knows how disappointing ""it was all a dream"" endings are (he's made fun of them before) so I imagine it won't be as simple as going back to the other universe. I think there will be a heavy price. Whether Eren is excluded from the recreated universe, or if everyone who died in the AoT universe is unable to be brought back, I think there will be a price."
invaderzz,Joet2386,"Same here, there needs to be consequences. When you deal with the devil there's always a catch."
emmyeggo,Killergamer7,I had a theory about an alternative universe for so long. I just didn't have enough evidence. Glad somebody creative enough like you put some time into this. I will be so happy if this turns out to be true
emmyeggo,Zinetti360,"If this ending ends up being true, I really can't tell if I would like this or not. I feel conflicted, VERY conflicted. I won't deny that this would be some genius shit and subvert everyone's expectations, but I don't see how this all would fit in SnK in a organic way. Idk, I feel like this doesn't belongs in this series, it would be way too off maybe. Imagine everything that was built so far, all the deaths, all the suffering, all this well built history being just a """"dream"""". It feels off.

Also, the majority of the readers and watchers never heard off this ""real world spin off series"" Isayama created. It would be weird for most of them to suddenly see SnK in the ""real world"" in the last chapters. 

In the end, if this is true, I'll probably like this ending because I read this theory and, therefore, knew of all the foreshadowing and justifications that makes it make sense, which most of the readers and watchers don't know or realized."
emmyeggo,Jysta_Fitendor,"The biggest hole I can find is that none of the AU content has appeared in the anime so far at all. Unless it was set up REALLY well at the end of the series, it would seem like one of the biggest asspulls of all time. 

The fact that this is the biggest hole I can poke is astounding though. Let‚Äôs see where this goes."
Jysta_Fitendor,emmyeggo,"(Sorry, I am copying and pasting a comment I previously made here): 

That's true, and I have been similarly confused as to how the anime will go about it (if this theory is correct). Perhaps this is why the animation studio has seemingly only committed to a part 1 of Season 4 so far?

That being said, it could still work in the anime; as seen above, most of the evidence for the alternate universe didn't actually come from the School Caste previews, but from clues in the anime/manga itself. It just may not be as effective for the anime only's (but perhaps that's why extra clues have been added in - such as the Tybur children in the school uniform)."
emmyeggo,BrklynDragon,"Yea but the caste previews are the crux of any of it making sense. The ending wouldn‚Äôt work without the caste previews because they‚Äôed otherwise be completely random introductions into the story that had no explanation. Even as caste previews they are awful setup and it‚Äôs gimmicky for the sake of it. This isn‚Äôt actually *great* story telling. This is just intentionally leaving out the entire actual plot of your story, like hiding the main Chicken Alfredo entree you ordered in the kitchen as the waiter slowly brought it out over the span of 2 hours, noodle by noodle."
emmyeggo,rings0fjupiter,I love theories like this!  Isayama mentioning muv-luv opens so many doors for complex theories!
emmyeggo,Kerim44,"The only thing wrong about this is the miner's tale. I'm pretty sure that I've read somewhere that his and his friends' disappearance was caused by the military police.

 By digging underneath the walls he discovered colossal titans, not knowing what he found, which was a pretty big no no"
Kerim44,emmyeggo,"I've tried to look everywhere for this source, do you happen to know where in the manga/anime it says this? :) 

Even still, it wouldn't really explain how the hole he had been digging for 20 years was completely gone in a matter of days - and that him and his friend (who wasn't involved in the digging) disappeared without a trace. 

However, I am probably biased, but this miner story was just an extra 'add' on that I thought was cool and could explain this all very nicely. This theory could potentially still be correct if this miner story ends up having no relevance."
emmyeggo,Kerim44,"Unfortunately I don't have a source for that. Now that I think about it, it was probably just one of many interpretations to the miner's story and it convinced me so much that I took it as a fact. 
I never thought what happened to that hole he digged so your interpretation is probably more accurate.

Love the theory btw. Still on the fence if I would like the ending to play out like that, but the fact that you found this many clues supporting it is commendable :)"
emmyeggo,Telodor567,"Hoooooooooooooooooly shit, this is the best AoT theory I've ever read! Amazing job, OP! Your evidence sounds extremely convincing, I just checked back on the very first chapter and the alternative universe would really make a lot of sense there."
emmyeggo,hornyyapraksarma,"kill the entire world

emmyeggo,DragoCrafterr,"If alternate timelines/universes are canon Madagascar is canon somewhere  


Also the leak thread would be absolutely hilarious"
emmyeggo,refletou,this is the one.
emmyeggo,BrunoSaurio,Don't mind I'm just looking at every fan theory to see how a good written ending looks like.
emmyeggo,Windstorm72,"A very well thought out theory, but I have to say my main problem with this ending is the same problem I have with almost all theorized endings. It puts the complete focus on Eren, and trivializes everything that the entire rest of the cast is going through. The entire alliance is characters we care about, to make it all not real would just deny them their due time. I dont think isayama would betray the readers by not giving us a good ending for every character, that‚Äôs just poor writing"
Windstorm72,emmyeggo,"Thanks for reading! I think I should clarify that the theory I am presenting postulates that both universes would be real, it's just Eren and the other characters would cease to exist inside of it (and instead travel again to the universe we see in the Attack on School castes).

I actually think this theory does the exact opposite of what you're suggesting (though I am biased); as it offers two endings for the readers- one in the Attack on Titan universe (and this gives all characters a chance to play a part, as we are seeing in the latest chapters), and then one in an alternative universe (allowing all our beloved characters, who all feature in the School Castes, to have a second chance, a normal life where they can finally be 'free.')

However, I do have a \[crack pot\] theory that Armin will sacrifice himself and stay behind in the current universe - hence why he is foreshadowed as the 'last man standing.' This would strengthen the connection between the two worlds."
emmyeggo,aynk,"Somebody give this man a gold award for pure effort.
Honestly though, I think this would be a mind-blowing ending."
emmyeggo,NGANAUGARAC,I would honestly love it if this became true. It would be such a unique ending and such a shocking one at that. What if Mappa decided to put the School AU as extra's at the end of the episode like juju strolls in JJK. This would be one way for anime only's to know of the AU's existence.
NGANAUGARAC,Joet2386,True it would there was that moment of those modern age school uniforms but that's about it.
emmyeggo,Faulky1x,"Another thing to point out is that In AOT the sun rises from west and sets in the east possibly hinting at a flipped/Alternate world and also as you mentioned in another comment in the anime there is no AU but there is again like you said alot of talk about alternate realities and dreams that felt like a lifetime

The sun part is shown if you go back to the last Episode of season 3 part 1 the night before the battle to retake wall maria. obviously its night time as it says in the title and we can see reiner and bertolt sitting on the wall facing north with the sun shining to their right side (east)

As for how we know they are looking north its because we see they are facing away from  Shiganshina and we know from the very first episode that titans attack from the south so them looking direct at the foot of the mountain can only mean they are looking north"
Faulky1x,emmyeggo,Great pick up!
emmyeggo,Saucy_Sicilian,"I went back and rewatched S4 EP5. When Tybur is giving his speech on stage he says, ""But I do not wish to die. And that is because I was born into **this** world."" Just before Tybur   says this line we pan to Eren in the basement where Reiner is on his knees, and as soon as Tybur utters ""this world"", Eren's eyes **noticably widen.** This is the **only time** in the entire basement conversation where Eren's eyes change at all or he reacts to anything, the rest of the scene his is stoic and monotone as if he were in complete in control.

If Eren has seen only **fragmented future memories** of this event, where Tybur gives a speech and Renier begs, it's possible he wasn't expecting Tybur to say ""this world"" and was caught off guard by the phrasing. This might support your theory considering the use of ""**this** world"" as opposed to ""**the** world"".

This could be the anime's nod to an AU, despite not animating anything from Caste yet."
Saucy_Sicilian,emmyeggo,Amazing pick up and analysis my friend !!
emmyeggo,CheetahTraditional24,"i was shocked because i just finished reading the 138 leaks then i found out about this theory after and how this user predicted about something related to Mikasa's scarf and the ""lets go home"" part will be mentioned in these 2 final chapters like damn"
emmyeggo,EDNivek,"> Just like the love interest in Muv Luv, Mikasa says 'see you later,' rather than 'goodbye,' hinting she and Eren will meet again.

Then you misunderstood the line's meaning in Muv Luv you say 'mata ne' when you want to see someone again, but you largely know *you won't* which is why the line hurts.

Plus apparently the line she says there is 'itteraishai'

But if this is true if Mappa doesn't have the series end on [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molAveWKOCA) I will understand how the OST people felt"
EDNivek,emmyeggo,"I figured bc I haven't played Muv Luv personally, I might not explain things to their fullest extent - so thanks for pointing that out. :) 

However, you are correct that Mikasa says 'itteraishai,' which is a word considered as equivalent to 'have a nice journey' in Japanese. 'Itteraishai' is generally said as a formula that responds to 'ittekimasu;' 'I am leaving.' It's often used in daily situations where people in the same family/house are separating to go to work. That's why to can also be translated as 'see you later,' as this formula implies that the persons involved will find each other at the end of the day/end of the trip - so it still works :)"
emmyeggo,Hard2GetYa,"I‚Äôd like to comment that another seemingly big inspiration for attack on titan is the book The Eternal Champion, it is about a guy who is summoned to another world I‚Äôm not going to explain it all here but there are multiple posts on reddit that highlight key points of inspiration from that story and attack on titan. But it definitely supports this theory due to both of these stories Isayama was inspired by involve alternate worlds/universes"
emmyeggo,Jasche7,"It's looking more and more like this ending is the direction the story is taking. I also realized that Gross's speech about humans desiring brutality and excitement (which Isayama VERY DELIBERATELY directed at the viewer and by extension pre-AOT Eren) greatly supports this interpretation, to the extent that I think you missed a huge opportunity mentioning it in your post. 

Pre-AOT Eren naively wanted an apocalyptic universe to live in, but when he found out that the real threat wasn't supernatural monsters that could be beaten but rather humans endlessly enacting cruelty on each other, he was ""disappointed"". He initially thought it would be cool, but in reality it was a hell beyond imagination."
Jasche7,Weewer,"Man that's such a good point. Disappointed is such an interesting word. Why disappointed? Not ""angry"" that everything that you've been through is the cause of other humans? Not ""sad"" that you will eventually kill them all? Disappointed is such a petty word to use at the revelation.

This theory is shaping up to actually be a cooler ending than the one we will likely get, which I'm sure will be good enough but pretty standard."
emmyeggo,Lesterberne,"This is really good thanks for your research! Honestly i didn‚Äôt expect a theory like this to ever show up but i love it and personally hope it does happen

EDIT: If anyone's looking for Attack on School Castes: https://imgur.com/a/vgtoh1T"
emmyeggo,b4rr3tt,"OH I FOUND SOMETHING NEW

In the full version of the Season 4 OP, one line is

‚ÄúLook down from above, I feel awful

The time has come, **let‚Äôs all go home**‚Äù"
emmyeggo,donuter454,"I read your post weeks ago but it has not left my mind since, and with every passing day I somehow become more and more convinced that this is the truth. Commenting to say that I was here when you predicted the most batshit plot twist Yams could ever pull.

inb4 we get anime OVAs after the series is over that covers the school caste adventures"
emmyeggo,Joet2386,"Oh my God, this theory is becoming more and more plausible."
emmyeggo,Melodic_Dot_7325,I only recognise this as an ending.
emmyeggo,kiddfrommars,Damn this actually makes sense
emmyeggo,TheLatinoThunda,"This also really makes sense when you think about ‚ÄúAoT‚Äù ending on chapter 139. Like other people have mentioned, the number 139 is significant in numerology as the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of something and the rebirth of another:

‚ÄúIn numerology the 139 symbolizes the end of something and the beginning of something else. In other words, the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of one thing and the rebirth of another. The 139 symbolizes an important change, which can be in the right or wrong direction.‚Äù

It‚Äôs possible that ‚ÄúAttack on Titan‚Äù as a world dies/ends on chapter 139, since it‚Äôs fulfilled its purpose by being destroyed. Then something would be rebirthed as a result, ie: the Attack on School Castes world, or something else.

So then it‚Äôs possible we get more after 139 from a ‚Äúrebirth‚Äù? Prob not, but it‚Äôs interesting to think about."
TheLatinoThunda,emmyeggo,"That makes so much sense! Which reminds me, in another interview, when asked about the ending of AOT, Isayama said ‚ÄòWell, it‚Äôs just the beginning!‚Äô"
emmyeggo,jez124,I highly doubt Isayama would continue the story after unless he has been trolling For years.
emmyeggo,yaujj36,"I think this theory changes how we look in AoT. The Eren from another universe morphogenetic travel to the AoT world with the start of the timeline, Chapter 1. He had the same personality and memories as AoT‚Äôs Eren and not much difference.

This all changed when he kiss Historia‚Äôs hand, it is not the royal blood rather by Ymir who sent all the memories Eren lost. This shocked Eren and he despaired over the situation. He knew he wanted to destroy humanity in his original universe. In a way, Eren did changed, he is not the AoT but rather the AoSC one. Like in AoSC, Eren regretted his dream so there are not much difference Eren in AoT world.

He pushed his friends away because I think he saw them as copy of his original universe friends. He did use lies back he meet Mikasa and Armin to justify his distance, maybe when he saw he hated Mikasa, because he saw her as a copy of the one from the original world. Of course he is also trying to train himself to be the villain, the one who destroy humanity on his original dream. We can see all over Marley and War of Paradis arc with him manipulating Zeke, torment his grandfather, goading his friends to attack and setting up the Yeagerists. Maybe Eren using the freedom ideology that his AoT counterpart have to justify his actions. 

Also I seen during the timeskip, Eren have prepare to be war with the world as seen in the shooting range. He is also seen cynical of the chance of peace, besides Eren wanted the world to be hostile at Paradis to give reason/excuse to destroy humanity. He also have a limited time gap to commit his action, that why he refused the 50 years plan not only to save Historia. He is not going through Marley conquest on Paradis despite different administration or Zeke's euthanization plan to go through as it seen to be time wasted spent in this world and clearly did not give a damn of consequences. Like in Eternal Champion, he wanted to slaughter his opponents as soon as possible and regret later, I think this is Eren's only way out of this cruel world that he wished. 

However, he still have emotions over his AoT friends and genuinely cared. I think Eren felt sorry for Ymir because he wished for the world in order to achieve his dream. In 131 where Kid Eren admiring the freedom, I think that is AoT Eren enjoying his dream, a somewhat kindness of the AoSC Eren to give AoT Eren the dream he wanted. Also in 853 in the train track, he did not want the Founding Titan to be passed on to his friends and don't want them to suffer the same fate as himself. After all knowing this world is created so Eren can destroy humanity can sent anyone to depression.

Also with Eren wishing the world, it made me switched perspective on Fritz I, he may be a cruel megalomaniac psychopath, but he is the devil that Eren asked for to create the world Eren desired. I haven't thought how Eren contact the devil but I ignored this for now. We know making deals with devils are unstable since the devil can name any price they want, so I am sure the devil wanted something harmful in exchange. Well I did thought of the parasite but this will derail the story we are talking about so I will skip. The devil disguise himself as Fritz I and uses Ymir to create the world Eren desired. When Ymir is in the Paths, he offer her a deal, freedom from the Paths in exchange on helping Eren to destroy humanity."
yaujj36,emmyeggo,Great analysis!
emmyeggo,Mayukh_Barua,Man you have a BIG BRAIN.
emmyeggo,Last_of_the_Dragon,"Listening the full ""My War"", I think you cracked the ending with this theory. I don't know if I like it or not, but if this will happen, will be an iconic ending either way."
emmyeggo,Aurelia_Ikram,"Idk if someone else has pointed this out, but remember in s3 when Carla said ‚ÄúEren is special because he was born into this world‚Äù? This could fit in with your theory. Before being born into the world of AoT Eren was a nobody, but when he switched to this new world where he was destined to become a villain, he became one of the most important people to ever live. I know the whole ‚Äúit was just a dream‚Äù thing is kind of cliche but I don‚Äôt think this is a necessarily bad ending. It definitely betrays the reader though lol"
emmyeggo,AbbyAZK,"After reading chapter 138, I really want to say, damn this theory is amazing because holy heavens did most of the stuff you discussed,  ESPECIALLY EREN AND MIKASA, their Relationship and its importance, just came true. Super excited for the last chapter tho."
emmyeggo,KaiserSenpaiAckerman,"I followed this theory for years, it was building up to this. 

I feel cheated, I feel like he changed the ending for whatever reason. Ch. 139 has to be an April Fools joke chapter."
emmyeggo,ErenTheRebel,Well it sounds good
emmyeggo,thot_buster04,"I think it would be a great ending and I think erens wish for another world is supposed to represent some readers wish,when you've read or watched an anime have you not wanted to go to that world and live in it because this world is normal and boring?I have so I think that would make more sense tbh and if this actually becomes true this means that everyone at the end will be living in a happy life"
thot_buster04,emmyeggo,"Yes, I‚Äôm so glad you pointed that out! I literally have a a screenshot of a message I sent to my friend in 2020 that said ‚ÄòMan, I wish I lived in the AOT world, my life feels so boring in comparison.‚Äô"
emmyeggo,MarchRoyce,"So I read this and didn't think much of it. Sounded neat I guess. Then, after today's episode, I went back and rewatched a couple of the ending themes. I listen to the openings often but don't revisit the endings too much. Season One's ending...my goodness, so many parallel world references and symbolism, all revolving around Mikasa.

 First is her running along the water's edge with a blurry, unclear upside down reflection. Then, she steps onto a field of knives, hundreds of copies of the same knife over and over like she has to keep reliving the same life and moments again and again. I don't know if it's because I just saw this so I'm seeing ghosts where there are none, but Season 1s ending gave me chills with this theory in mind"
emmyeggo,i__rage,"I love this. The idea of an ending to our tragic story  and then a secret happy/bittersweet ending is everything i could ask for ‚ù§

 In the alternate universe, Erwin could become a teacher like his father. Levi could have his tea shop and be annoyed by constant school kids. Maybe Zeke will adopt a child, be a community baseball coach? Sasha and niccolo would be a thing omg. Connie and who knows. Reiner would be a hero like figure in the media or something. Hange will still be ambiguous and nerdy and moblit still hanges assistant. Ymir and historia would be a thing. Jean would be a police chief and his assistant would be marco. I could just keep imagining. 

Op if this isnt true i will be heartbroken."
i__rage,Karsbestantagonist,"Your what I can presume are guess‚Äôs are very close to the actual School previews, erwins a history teacher, Levi‚Äôs a janitor and hanj is a biology teacher, as far as I know season 4 stuff hasn‚Äôt been written in the AU, Hisu is literally a queen bee, Ymir is basically a simp, reiners your typical jock/asshole stereotype, jean is trying to be a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù to impress mikasa. But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some of your other guesses would be correct"
emmyeggo,zackfair8575,Amazing theory! Though I think you theory wont be realized it's interesting just how much manga content can be used as evidence for your alternative universe ending.

emmyeggo,Funkyhamster,"I can‚Äôt see the ending actually focusing on the Attack on School Castes AU, given that it only appeared in the volume releases (and given that it also would be really random and anticlimatic), but after reading this post, I could see the ending establishing or hinting at a mythology that makes Attack on School Castes canonical (e.g., having PATHS allow reincarnation or multiple universes)."
Funkyhamster,emmyeggo,"That‚Äôs a fair point! And you could very well be right - or perhaps instead of revealing this in the main story, the final School Castes preview shows Eren waking up by the tree in Chapter 1, so its an implied thing rather than outright. 

However, contrary to what you‚Äôre saying, I still think there‚Äôs enough for it to work in the main story. Reason being is that a majority of the ‚Äòevidence‚Äô for this theory didn‚Äôt actually come from the School Castes, but from clues in the main story (as well as clues in the opening and ending songs). People have long suspected that an alternate universes/time loop ending could be possible; it‚Äôs just that the two past memory shards of Goth Mikasa/Nerd Armin and Ymir Fritz really got the ball rolling for me on the idea. I also think that for this to be an effective reveal/plot twist (if this theory is indeed correct), then the School Castes aren‚Äôt actually needed at all. Isayama can pull an alternate universe twist without these previews (considering all the other ‚Äòevidence‚Äô I‚Äôve shown); it‚Äôs just that the School Castes, if you‚Äôre paying attention, might also help to clue you in as a ‚Äòbonus.‚Äô 

That‚Äôs just my interpretation though. Ofc I fully realise that this is just a theory :)"
emmyeggo,Ozyemdias,I hate how plausible this is.
Ozyemdias,Joet2386,"Understandable, but it wouldn't be out of nowhere."

During the flashback
>""Everyone says Eren has changed. Even I believed it. But maybe that's wrong. **Eren hasn't changed one bit from the start.** If that's who Eren truly was all along... what part of him... had I been seeing?""

-
After the rumbling begins

ErwinSmith_GOAT,emmyeggo,"That‚Äôs an incredible pick up! Characters mentioning ‚Äòset in stone from the start,‚Äô always threw me off and suspected something else could be (maybe) going on. 

I also actually think there‚Äôs more to Mikasa than I originally suspected; the comment she makes when she sees Eren die (about witnessing it ‚Äòagain and again‚Äô), and then in her OVA I believe she makes a comment about ‚Äòeach time Eren always dies.‚Äô It made me remember last night that in Muv Luv, there‚Äôs multiple ‚Äòbad‚Äô endings that you can achieve, and you‚Äôd have to ‚Äòrestart,‚Äô so this might be just a crackpot thought - but I wonder if Eren has tried all these various routes (or Paths ü§î) before, and Mikasa knows this?

emmyeggo,bhavish2023,I will save this post so that I can give it an award later
emmyeggo,VanaTun,"UPVOTE. Nice theory right there, wouldn't mind that kind of ending honestly. It feels interesting."
emmyeggo,thesnail1,"Man I can't stop thinking of this since I read your theory . It makes so much sense and I find it having things in common with the Death of Mikasa theory. It might cause some people to be disappointed, but I think that this is the most complete way to wrap up the story. Its just mind-blowin, I hope we get to it comes true."
emmyeggo,sokidan,"I honestly like this theory a lot. There's more depth to this than a simple, 'it was all a dream' type ending. Also, I have always expected this series, from the entire way it has been written, to have a strange and unusual ending, not something mundane or clear-cut. There are only two chapters left, there's little time to wrap the story up. But this theory COULD occur in two chapters, at least, I believe so. Either way this was fun to read. Great work putting all this together!"
emmyeggo,DIMGOD,Fuck you man. I hate you because you're right
emmyeggo,ItsToLate09,"This does make sense to me it's a great theory and for me this ending is completely fine, I have just one thing to add to this and it's the loop theory. For me the time loop theory was also very credible so what if it was a mix between the two ? 
Eren wished for the AOT story to happen while he lived in a parallel universe, he made a deal with Ymir though the deal would only be completed if he actually manages to ""Destroy humanity"" and become the enemy of the world he lives in. So if doesn't manage to get there the universe resets to it's start point which is ep1 and then you can basically insert the time loop theory (https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lxy1q5/most_probable_ending_theory_youll_ever_read/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) which adds some interesting points and actually fits nearly perfect into this one I would only use your ending which is more fitting, I especially liked the parralel grisha - Eren whit the new life without memories. For me this ending is more credible."
emmyeggo,abubonicrat,This is presented very well and I would be super happy with this ending. Thanks for putting this together !
emmyeggo,vngu123,I honestly can‚Äôt be upset if this many hints were left throughout the years. I can only applaud Isayama.
emmyeggo,dentop1,Holy shit dude ur onto something i guess after ch 138 LOL
emmyeggo,jarvisrickard05,"This is a super impressive theory, but if it ends like this I'll be beyond disappointed."
jarvisrickard05,Aslan_Callenreese,"Yea same fr. I understand how the theory works, but I believe more so in the timeloop there than this one."
emmyeggo,Djeezas,If this is true I hope this will all only be hinted at
emmyeggo,Metbert,I love it and I hate it... damn I would love Isayama if he pulls something like that.
emmyeggo,wishyouwerewithme,I like this this is very different from the other theories!!
emmyeggo,dickbutt2202,"This is amazing, thank you for the effort"
emmyeggo,lksgman,"One of the things you can also see with this theory is with the Opening 6 with the lyrics:

""Destruction and Regeneration 

You are the real enemy."" 

I would be amazed if this becomes real."
emmyeggo,ChinesCultureClub,"This is genuinely mind-blowing, I can't wrap my head around just how much research and time you had to spend to reach this absolutely amazing theory. Honestly even if this ending doesn't come true the fact that you made all these deep connections with the most minimal details is already so impressive. I hope after the manga ends isayama can see this and have it translated, I feel that he'd be equally impressed. Honestly I think there's a good chance even if this ending does happen, Isayama wouldn't have connected as many details as you did, maybe I'm underestimating him though."
emmyeggo,downtimeredditor,"Yeah I would strongly prefer Mikasa and eren to be together in the end. 

I don't like the Jean x mikasa ship. it just feels wrong for some reason.  But like you said Isayama will betray the readers so I guess I'm ready for that pain.

The story is the story. 

If this is the ending. I may like only because it ends with Eren and Mikasa together.."
emmyeggo,Vannarep,"Personally, I would love this kind of ending as I absolutely adore fiction that attempts to trick/betray the reader, but I would be worried for the fanbase reaction. 

I think this is epic. Amazing work putting this together, honestly. Do you think all of the classroom art for the newest opening, as well as the mentioning of 'school' is concrete evidence? To do with that as well, if this isn't the ending (say for example the alliance wins) what would the classroom stuff even mean?"
emmyeggo,Dark_Monster3112,Remember me when this blows up...
emmyeggo,purpleunicornwalk,"Really thought provoking analysis. I could also see the ending being an alternate universe ending that doesn‚Äôt involve the school universe also. There‚Äôs certainly heavy foreshadowing at a possibly cyclic timeline, I think some of the evidence you use could also simply imply parallel versions of the AoT world (like goth mikasa and nerd armin in a past attempt)."
emmyeggo,Nelomaren,RemindMe! 13 April 2021
emmyeggo,drowninghitagi,"the whole time i was reading this i could only keep saying ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù and ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù to myself because fucking hell, everything makes complete sense."
emmyeggo,Captured-Light,"I was just looking through this in volumes 26-32 and as I was reading it and watching the odd way Ymir appears, the more I was convinced this theory might be on to something. Eren is the only one who can see Ymir. And she looks the same as she does in the regular story. 

On top of that, the final exchange between them in Volume 32 is 

Ymir appears before Eren.

Eren says ‚ÄúThe one and only god Ymir has bestowed upon me her message!! Now all of humanity will be saved!!‚Äù 

The timing of the way that story has been progressing through each volume is oddly suspicious. Now it could just be us reading too much into it all. But your theory and what I just looked through seems to hint to something."
emmyeggo,brouverhoog,the ending might  actually turn out this way with the reveal off the new highschool caste au leaks
emmyeggo,Traditional-Path-727,I think it would be awesome if it plays out this way.
emmyeggo,JuanSeV2356,"That would be so incredibly anti-climatic...But on the other hand, if you, freaking mad lad, are right, Isayama will forever be remembered as one of the greatest writers ever. That level of story telling would actually be fucking nuts."
emmyeggo,Kingyexiu,It can be really true
emmyeggo,InAsianSpaces,"Okay, I'm not going to lie when I started reading I was like ""yeah, right"" but by the end of it...it does make a lot of sense.

It would explain Eren saying that when he learned that humanity existed beyond the walls he was ""disappointed"". 

And it would explain the ""You started this story, didn't you"" right along with the ""Because I was born into **this** world"" line that Eren, Wily, Zeke, etc have said before. And the common theme.

And if that's true about Mikasa not having a memory wipe, it would explain her ""Ackerman genes"" activating - meaning her true power of knowing the truth of their world activating. That raises the stakes on her being unsure if Eren and herself will die forever if something happens, which is why she is so overprotective of him - she just wants to go home and return to their normal life.

(I wonder if this carries over to Levi as well. And to a certain extent, Kenny...since he wanted to be a serial killer in the capital.)

Man...this really would hurt a lot of Isayama's readers. I've never cared for Mikasa like that, but if she's the only one who knew the truth of **this** ""cruel, yet beautiful"" world...that'd be so fucked.

Over 10+ years living in a nightmare that Eren wished for, only for him to find out towards the end of his contract with Ymir...That still wouldn't explain what exactly Ymir is though. 

But if she was a slave in Eren's world...the Attack Titan's story...then maybe he saved her because she gave him the power in that world. He's the Earth Devil set to destroy it, and she was just an ordinary girl changed by unassuming circumstances in her character backstory...similar to Eren in the actual real world of HS Castes.

&#x200B;

Either way, very fascinating theory. I completely see the story differently now, and it's not a bad thing. All of the classroom stuff rferences and random Mikasa outbursts make perfect sense now. 

Or Mikasa's pained expression in that chapter when Eren goes to yell at Mikasa and Armin and then beats Armin up. When he throws a punch at Eren (or tries) Mikasa basically body slams him and then looks surprised and ashamed of herself. Maybe it was her reflex or ""Ackerman instincts"" (in that world) to protect him because she really wants to go home and he's her ticket out of there as well.

Like she wants to tell Armin the truth, but can't. And Eren won't listen to her.

Not to mention, I always thought the Tybur children's school uniforms were out of place. 

I recently re-watched Ep 22 of S3 to look at what flashbacks came true so far in season 4 and thought it was odd. Would make perfect sense if Eren was getting mixes of both the real world and his 'fantasy' Eldian life on Paradis....as the Earth Devil from Paradise who destroys the world."
InAsianSpaces,emmyeggo,"Amazing insights, thank you so much for sharing!"
emmyeggo,Fuzzy_Ad_6575,"I‚Äôm not mad or happy. I‚Äôm just genuinely glad that I found this theory, out of all of the theories this is by far my favourite. Whether or not it‚Äôs real, this is some thought out shit and I commend you for that. I genuinely hope this is true because as you said, this theory would leave all readers feeling betrayed and heartbroken. Thank you for sharing. 
With the recent chapter dropping last week I think your theory is getting more and more real."
emmyeggo,tamvanum,"So the [lyrics for My War](https://genius.com/Shinsei-kamattechan-boku-no-sensou-lyrics)'s full version came out and I noticed the part with Japanese lyrics has something interesting... 

 *(I have to do my homework and sleep)*   


And after seeing/hearing that I instantly thought of this post and came back here. Not sure if anyone has brought it up already, but check it out anyway. Could be a mistranslation by Google, I'm not 100%."
emmyeggo,ProfessionalPomelo85,"This is my bet on most possible theory, but with some slight modifications -- Eren will survive and the alliance will be reincarnated in the AU, but die in this worldline. Only Mikasa will remember this world. Then, he'll go back to hisu and hold his kid for final panel. Akatsuki no Requiem + AU. Pure kino in my opinion. Bittersweet in the most extreme way possible."
emmyeggo,DasZweite, THIS WAS THE BEST POST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE! DUDE YOU REALLY DEDICATED TIME TO THIS AND TO BE SINCERE I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THIS THEORY OF DREAM UNTIL I SEE YOUR POST. NOW I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY SOUL.

emmyeggo,Abmesch,"For those who didn‚Äôt know I remember Isayama saying he based some of SNK on when he was in school, especially the Titans symbolizing Bullies and that at an internet Cafe he saw a woman who inspired Mikasa. love this theory, I had similar views as you posted here but my thoughts were that the world where light doesn‚Äôt reach, actually was the Paths, and once the world is destroyed they will be connected where all things can be connected, I had Evangelion vibes from SNK that the ending will be similar to how the Human Instrumentality Project."
emmyeggo,genesis1v9,"Bump, 100% confirmed."
emmyeggo,wonderisa,"Great theory, thank you for your effort. I'm betting on this x)

Did you watch Mikasa's OVA?"
emmyeggo,brettums,I found this theory of yours after reading 138 and holy hell I think you are probably actually Eren
emmyeggo,yourmommaissagae,I'm not a fan of this ending but I must applaud the amount of time and effort you put into this. My mind is fucked.
emmyeggo,Za_Warudo3,Great job collecting evidence and such but no offence but if this theory is true everything up to the ending would just feel cheap and pointless
Za_Warudo3,emmyeggo,"I think many people will share a similar opinion. However, if this theory is correct, I have faith that Isayama will pull it off. Plus, it's kinda cool that Eren Yeager was the true villain this entire time, and we were kept in the dark for over a decade until the very end."
emmyeggo,bjohn876,"If it true, the opening lyrics ""you are the real enemy"" will be more make sense."

emmyeggo,bellamrjrie,THIS IS AMAZING!! it makes so much sense
emmyeggo,Bleh_Bleh_Bleh_12,"Honestly, I would really like this ending (however, I don't think this is going to be it). It would be such a twist that no one saw coming. And it does tie in well with all the loose ends so far. Fantastic job!"

emmyeggo,AlucardElite,I can completely see this coming true to be honest!
emmyeggo,danielredmayne,"""To You: 2000 Years From Now"" still makes sense. It was from Ymir, who waited 2000 years for Eren's wish to be fulfilled before finally ending the brutal world for good."

emmyeggo,Wyyynt,"To you, 2000 years ago make so much sense now, ""to you"" means, eren's wish, to live in another world, that was the present ymir gave him, this world that eren wanted to destroy, she gave him that but in exchange, eren must do something for her. I think the deal was to free her"
emmyeggo,bullet_toni,"Well, this would be good, because there is no world left to live in, i mean Eren destroyed everything, what's the point to show the characters living in a fully apocalyptic world, hopeless?"
emmyeggo,Bradley_Solomon,">For example, you can play Muv Luv Alternative without actually playing Muv Luv Extra (which shows the ‚Äòpast‚Äô universe).

UH. No Muv-Luv Alternative is the third part of a trilogy and Muv-Luv Extra plays an important role in establishing the characters and themes. and the events of Extra directly tie into the plot of Alternative. Alternative calls back to very specific events from Extra that become important later on, so obviously you're supposed to read Extra. so no, you can't simply just read Alternative without reading Extra (and by extension Unlimited). all the worldbuilding and set-up and foreshadowing throughout Extra and Unlimited is 100% necessary to the story of Alternative. *that's how trilogies work.*

additionally, Muv-Luv was originally planned out and written as one overarching story. Alternative is not seperate from Extra and Unlimited. all three titles form one complete narrative.

&#x200B;

>It‚Äôs just a bonus if you do.

ML EXTRA IS NOT ALTERED FABLE. did you even read Muv-Luv? cuz if you didn't you really should not be talking about it or using it as an example so extensively, even if it's what directly inspired AoT. honestly you should've read the Muv-Luv Trilogy in full if you were gonna compare it to AoT so much."
emmyeggo,MakoShark93,"What if Eren just keeps on waking up in different universes with the same symbolical themes but a different expression? So instead of Titans, there is a different thing to defeat -- there is a larger problem but the same problem; yet everything connects."

emmyeggo,TofuRat,"This is insane but I believe it and think It has alot of evidence the only thing I have to say is I would not want this ending because the anime only's have way less to base off of. (While yes they get extra info like Falco's memory and the tybur kids.) They still have never seen this ""real world"" or alternative world. So I fear this ending would feel extremely cheap to them (and some manga readers too) unless of course chapter 138 or 139 are super long and detailed and put all the loose ends to rest. Which I honestly believe Isayama can pull off. However if Isayama does not pull off this ending perfectly this would receive mass backlash and I would be very disappointed. So to wrap it up I hope Isayama continues to do Isayama things and doesn't screw this up! If he makes this theory canon and explains it very well then this might be one of the most insane twists ever. (sorry if a lot of this message seems incoherent or just rambling its 5am for me rn)"

emmyeggo,whatisgoingonpeople,"Hey, I left a comment yesterday about how some things did not add up to this theory. Today, I reread chapter 137, and I concluded that there is an ALTERNATIVE WORLD in AOT. However, it is not the world you are talking about. The alternative world is nothing other than THE PATHS. At the beginning of chapter 137, Zeke mentions how Ymir Fritz gave birth to something stronger, larger, to an undying body. Then he added ‚ÄúShe escaped to a WORLD that was free... of even death.‚Äù Armin then asks ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there some way of getting back to the outside WORLD from here?‚Äù The time when Eren tells Ymir that he will put an end to THIS WORLD, he did not mean any world other than THE PATHS it self. He wants to put an end to the WORLD of suffering that Ymir lived in for the past 2,000 years... This is what came up to my mind when I reread the chapter, what do you think about it??"
whatisgoingonpeople,emmyeggo,"That's really interesting, and could definitely be true. My only problem with that is that when he said 'I'll put an end to THIS world,' he then went ahead with the Rumbling, which implies that he is instead trying to put an end to the world we see in AOT (not Paths).  


Paths also existed before the titan powers came about (as in Chp 122, we see that when Ymir dies, she is taken to Paths, but it's only when her body is eaten that the 'tree of light' with 3 branches appears; representing the 'Subjects of Ymir'). I personally believe Paths to be the meta-physical connection between these alternate universes (but that's really just a guess at this stage)."
emmyeggo,whatisgoingonpeople,"It is so weird that he went ahead with the Rumbling. If you look at Chapter 137, Zeke mentioned that Ymir Fritz still felt connected to the world she left behind her. Why would Ymir even agree to destroying the world she could not leave behind??? I honestly do not know what is going on XD Also, I just read the full lyrics of ""My War"" and I am mind blown. A little girl was singing about school? I am so confused. My brain is so fried at this point"
emmyeggo,Akira-one,"first of all congratulations on your theory, really crazy, I like it.  I want to say mine, in my opinion the ending could leave room for all these fan theories, finishing the work with more questions than answers in an Evangelion style, which in the end is a very doable thing, think about how isayama treated the work. let me know"
emmyeggo,pinstripejacket,"This makes sense! And I love it, because I remember reading somewhere that Hajime thought about the ending from the start. And also that I relate to this so much -- I watch AOT to escape my own life now (wishing also for freedom/adventure). And it's just apt that Eren wished for that too... and so it's this after all! Hmmm really it's not bad... Thinking this is really plausible!  


\[edit\] And this makes sense too for Mikasa's character. Since she's probably somewhat in on it, there's something really compelling her to go and protect Eren!

&#x200B;

\[edit2 \] And could it be possible that it's also part of the seance that EMA were having in the Junior high AOT? Haha. Maybe somehow they didn't close the seance (they didn't finish the MIKA...SA thing) and so that's why Eren was able to make a deal with the devil? haha. Just random things I'm realizing)"
emmyeggo,nosafebox,"my favourite theory. it was weird why the My War cover art is a photo of classroom? Thought it was just a 'cover thing (doesn't have to make sense, y'know)' and now you said this i thought well might as well give this theory a shot

ALSOOOOO this could be such a comic relief for me, AoT has been dark and to pull this off as the ending would be pretty much relaxing hahah lol. thank you for contributing sumn good to the fandom!"
emmyeggo,Faulky1x,"Keep reading till the end you‚Äôll understand it more, Also Something interesting I found that might give us hints to the characters who have potential to die in the finale is the friend groups. Yes you heard that right Isayama typically likes to have groups of friends consisting of 2 boys and 1 girl- examples are Eren Mikasa and Armin, Levi Erwin and Hange, Reiner Bertolt and Annie and then Jean Connie and Sasha now don‚Äôt get me wrong I completely understand all of these characters are friends aswell but you can‚Äôt deny the bond between 3 characters as 1 group is a lot more Prominent than the rest and I‚Äôve noticed when 1 character dies or something bad happens the rest of the Group crumble aswell and it was right under our noses from the start when Eren first transformed into a Titan after being eaten we saw Armin and Mikasa become Suicidal in a sense and have no point in living demonstrated by Mikasa using all her gas knowing damn well she couldn‚Äôt make it but she was ok with dying because Eren did Armin also requested Mikasa leaves a blade with him so he could finish himself off. Or When Erwin died Levi and Hanges attitude completely changed Levi didn‚Äôt want to fight anymore and Hange died recently as we know. Same goes for Bertolt after he died Reiner was filled with instant regret and as he said just wanted to die peacefully. Same after Sasha died Connie and Jeans attitude changed Connie got to the point where he almost seemed like he wanted to die when he was dangling from Erens rib bone. Basically what I think Isayama is getting at is that these groups of 3 are important by this I mean once 1 person in the group dies the rest are guaranteed to follow them to their grave so based off this Judgement I‚Äôve came to the conclusion of who I believe will survive and who will die in the finale 
Deaths - Connie Levi Jean Reiner Annie 
Survivors - Mikasa Armin Gabi Falco Eren 
This is based purely on the fact Isayama hasn‚Äôt touched the main group of 3 basically at all and when he does there is next to no chance they lose the fight yes I do believe the alternate universe ending theory is most likely but I feel that Isayama wants us to recognise the power of building strong relationships with others can have."

Also Reiner: The worst possible person to have the coordinate.... is you, Eren.


This makes AOT junior high a strange half world. An in between world. This makes before the fall even less canon because how could those characters exist when the world didn‚Äôt exist yet?"
lirbe,yaujj36,"The world was ‚Äúcreated‚Äù 1800 years ago when Ymir inherit the Titan powers. As long the devil can craft a world that lead genocide as the only solution, it fullfill Eren‚Äôs naive dream. 

Also the quote ‚ÄúI was born into this world‚Äù, I think it is more that he was born in order to fullfill his genocide dream. Eren regrets it but can‚Äôt turn back. After all, this is the story he wished for, the devil will create a hellish world to give justification for genocide.

The devil is Fritz I, Ymir is just a broker"
emmyeggo,HazzoElric,"I have information that supports this theory.In the opening lyrics of the new season, we can see that it makes reference to the inverted city and the sunset of  [Akatsuki no Requiem MV](https://youtu.be/OrQ0zZArUV8?t=86), I mean that [here](https://prnt.sc/103sxwz).

Looking at the complete song, we can see that there is reference to [this](https://prnt.sc/103sxc2)*üì∑*

For what reason this reference? Clearly this is  Akatsuki no Requiem. They are different songs and other than that, this mention does not make sense. I believe that the manga will end at sunset, the transition will be made at this time of the day. The song also says about ""next year"" I think it's about Eren's 20 years.*üì∑*"

emmyeggo,niviokiller,"This is BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING"
emmyeggo,Poverty_King,Genius.
emmyeggo,aynk,I actually want this to be the ending now...
emmyeggo,jimimochi,I don't care what other people say-- the theory included a world where Eren and Mikasa are happy... so obviously I'm in! Amazing job :>>
emmyeggo,Qweruiptirpeuo,omg this is mindblowing
emmyeggo,Sblve,"Meanwhile isayama himself lurking in this sub : ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)b



Damn this is my favorite theory, I think this theory is the one that satisfy many readers because it's open up a lot of possibilities and the idea itself is very fun to think haha. Well done! Also is it possible to link this theory with the Madagascar one lol."
emmyeggo,Safaa_11,"I just came back to this and holy one thing you were right so far, is that its all ending in chapter 139. Scary man. Now we wait for chapter 139."
emmyeggo,atharvvvg,"That Ymir Fritz memory shard from Chapter 120 was from the last panel in chapter 138, telling us that that kiss scene wasn't actually Mikasa imagining it :)"
emmyeggo,AnonymousAngel111,I am MIND BLOWN.
emmyeggo,emasupremacy,"i love how controversial this ending is. you can never please everyone, so no matter how isayama chooses to end it, there will be endless debates about it. that's what will keep this anime alive for years to come. i'm really excited but nervous for april 9th."
emmyeggo,Low_Run545,"With the new leaks you may possibly be right, wow."
emmyeggo,arminswaifu-,"this was worth the read. idk how to feel about the theory but, it's interesting."
emmyeggo,Agnusl,"Did you already posted something like that on r/ShingekiNoKyojin once?

I remember seeing this very theory with the same arguments, but this time it seems to have almost double the development.

Either that or... Whose memories are those?"
Agnusl,emmyeggo,"Nope! Though it wouldn't surprise me if others have caught onto this as well, the Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin memory shard is really strange."
emmyeggo,sh7e_cule,"Indeed it's a betrayal to the readers, but this ending will leave a bitter taste and HUGE emptiness inside us."
emmyeggo,knight_of_lonjor,there's another alternate universe in snk. And it's in ova lost girl. what your opinion about that episode?
emmyeggo,Armendou,"Love the effort and can't deny that it's plausible at some points, but it also seems like a reach to me a few times. I personally would hate an ending like this. Our cast fights for four seasons to reach their goals and Eren commits omnicide, just so they can teleport back to an alternate universe without their memories? Defeats the journey for me"
emmyeggo,Baaartolome,Any idea where i can read a compilation of that aot au spinoff?
emmyeggo,dogdaysareove,"this is a horrifying idea, good job op"
emmyeggo,wellmade-mango,Reading thru this I started hyperventilating this is TERRIFYING
emmyeggo,maiyamay,"Idk how to feel abt this tbh, but if it does happen it makes sense. Tho am the only one seeing Historia as a combination of Dina + Carla?"
emmyeggo,MrTopHatMan90,"I could accept this beimg ending, I would really hate it but could accept it. Nice job OP really well researched, really cool, hope it never happens."
emmyeggo,al3x11_,"amazing read, if anything close to this happens it would be crazy, thank u for putting so much time into this"
emmyeggo,asdfghjung,"this is so controversial

i love it"
emmyeggo,BrokeAssStudent11,"So the 'destruction'/AoT universe as we know it is literal, and everyone else is in it too? Not simply a dream?"
BrokeAssStudent11,emmyeggo,"That‚Äôs what I theorise, correct! The AOT universe ‚Äòexists,‚Äô and isn‚Äôt merely a figment of Eren‚Äôs imagination - but he‚Äôll likely ‚Äòforget‚Äô about it. Parallels nicely w Chapter 1; Eren woke up from a ‚Äòreally long‚Äô dream and ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt remember‚Äô it."
emmyeggo,Joet2386,"True it would, and the only one who'd remember it would likely be Mikasa"
emmyeggo,Kairo333,"Bruh, you need to read the Lost Girls manga with Mikasa and update the OP post. You could find more evidence.

Read the manga though. Anime version had some stuff cut short."
emmyeggo,legendstuf,is there a chance this is also why the world in aot is flipped from ours?
emmyeggo,Changlini,"Wow, what a read!

I want this to happen now, just to see the reaction from the Anime community lol"
emmyeggo,Incalculas,Remindme! 2 months
emmyeggo,DragonDDark,"Good theory. Even though I might be disappointed if it happens, at least it makes sense."
emmyeggo,downtimeredditor,"Just wanted to add a quick note: 

When Eren tells Reiner ""we are the same you know"" 

While it is interpreted as brining in mass destruction and chaos.

Reiner breaking the wall in Shingashana bringing in the Titans and Eren causing the rumbling. 

One could also portray it as wanting actions in life. 

Rather than return to Marley which Annie and Bertolt wanted to do after Marcel is eaten. Reiner wanted to continue the mission to bring chaos in a land that is pretty much alternative to his. Paradis despite their advances in ODM gear and the bomb spears they are still using very primative tech. They don't even have electricity. Reiner could have lived a boring life in Marley without any harm. Grisha could have lived a long life as a Doctor in Marley for example. But he joined the military at a young age. I get that part of the reason Reiner joined is because his uncle I think was part of the resistance with Grisha and this would help his family situation. But I think he is using it as more of an excuse for breaking this dull life. Let's be honest his family still suffers from the apartheid regime in Marley.  He could have left back to Marley after Marcel's death but he pushes on to bring destruction to Paradis. Similarly eren went into this universe to bring destruction to the rest of the universe to get away from his boring life."
downtimeredditor,emmyeggo,"Such a great analysis, thanks for sharing!"
emmyeggo,downtimeredditor,"So I recently like literally less than an hour ago from when I post this comment made a post about how Eren being forced to carry out this predestined rumbling is just really cruel. Like he knew in 850 what he must do. And it was just cruel to make him see and interact with people who he is about to kill. It just felt like a torture to tell a guy hey you are about to commit mass genocide but you got also have to see and interact with them before. 

So this alternative universe theory is a saving grace for me. As much as I know a lot of people would hate this ending I personally love it."
downtimeredditor,yaujj36,"I think you mix up Falco and Reiner, Falco forced to joined the Warriors because of his uncle treason.

Reiner joined the Warriors to return to his Marleyan father but you are right about one thing, Reiner wanted to be a hero to be praised and respected. A selfish wish to escape a dull world like Rren"
emmyeggo,4phoneshawty,I read this the other day and Was surprised at how much it can apply. But then after days of re reading chapters and watching a few episodes it‚Äôs sticking in my head. So many things are worded weirdly about worlds and lives it‚Äôs messing with me now lol
emmyeggo,LunaNogood,"This is a good theory that made sense compare to other theories, tho I dont know how the fans readers and viewers will take it, But yeah this well detailed theory."
emmyeggo,LunaNogood,So mappa would animate caste along side with the main plot for it to be possible.
emmyeggo,Higoraishi,"I love this theory : it seems as probable that improbable. But something attract my mind : the fact that the volumes of AOT finished with even-numbered. With the link you put about the numerology of the number 139, we can see something. If it's correct, the number 139 is ""also synonymous with treason and ...."". If my reasonning is correct, then, maybe the chapter 139 will not be the end of the story. Maybe it will end with the AOT universe, but if a 140's chapter exist, it will probably linked to the ""School Caste"" plot. It maybe a crazy argument, but the treason is something really important in the story, and i will not be surprised if Isayama betrayed us, with doing a ""last chapter""."
emmyeggo,ZookerMANKE,"One thing that would make the most sense if theirs two separate endings rather than them being combined. To people like you who know about the Castes alternate universe, you can take this ending as your ending and people who don‚Äôt can take the other. I just find that while this ending would be a god brained ending, Isayama had originally planned to end the series along time ago, at around them fighting Zeke, Armin, and Bertolt so I think the series would have ended when they finally find the basement.
So I‚Äôm pretty sure that while this ending may seem full proof, he may not have thought about it yet or if he had then he maybe just didn‚Äôt plan on adapting it."
emmyeggo,bobohuns,"I believe the part about the parallel universes being connected, but I don't think Isayama will use that to end the story, mostly because those previews were always treated as special/extra content and not everyone has read them. If they really contained such important info to understand the ending, they should've been part of the official manga and anime so viewers could understand everything. 

Your theory makes sense! But I think Isayama will give an actual solution to the problems in the AOT universe and let that reality run its course, instead of merging both dimensions and being like ""it was all a dream!""

Cool theory! It was very interesting to read :D"
emmyeggo,veritaserum9,Amazing read! I love this.
emmyeggo,polarm00n,"my favorite theory by far, I really hope this is true"
emmyeggo,johnkilroy6,mind blown
emmyeggo,sokidan,"I went back and reread some of the beginning of the manga after having gone through your theory earlier today, and Mikasa is much more peculiar than I remembered. There's a lot of strange things she says and feels, but one thing that stood out to me is in Chapter 7, when she believes she will die, she remembers Eren's words to fight and also him sleeping at the Ch.1 tree, and then thinks, ""I'm sorry Eren, I can't give up. If I die, I won't even be able to remember you"". What does that mean? Why was she apologizing for continuing to fight? I find that really odd. Does it have something to do with these alternate universes and Mikasa's role in each of them? I don't know what to make of it at all, but it is interesting to reread all this with the theory in mind.

Also forgive me if I'm stupid and this bit was explained later in the manga. It's been a long time sine I've read these older chapters"
emmyeggo,fuchsiabear,"Thats amazing, would be happy if it ends this way. This game got me interested too... I never saw anyone talking about this game as an inspiration to snk

Great theory! Good job"
emmyeggo,ExtraOrdinaryWizard,"wow, good job. It sounds really plausible. I don‚Äôt like this theory, but maybe that changes once the last chapters are out. 

-Still hoping for a different ending tho"
emmyeggo,RXJ1131,"Well done! I like this theory, you put time and it's well researched. It also makes sense! An alternative world seems quite likely, since it looks like a compromise for both alliance and Eren. It kinda reminds me the finale of Darker than Black if you watched it, maybe it's a stretch, but it's similar.  
Ymir might have caused the beginning of this world when she came in contact with the primitive life and by killing that source they could possibly erase everything titans related, I mean that by killing it in the present, kills it also in the past.  
Thus the regular world will take place and everything will progress just like in the real world, and we will have modern cities and stuff.  
Don't mind XD I just wanted to add something, as this theory makes sense and I actually like it."
emmyeggo,jiyuu_da_orewa,"You are amazing for picking up on all these hints, I'm starting to believe that this is how it will turn out , but maan !  I don't know how i feel about it. One thing is  sure : SNK will not have the same impact on me as before ."
emmyeggo,PandaIthink,"I just want everyone to know I was here before the ending. I DONT CARE If this theory proved to be true or false because either way  Isayama promised BETRAYAL SO INTENSE THAT IT WILL BE THE GREATEST ANIME BETRAYAL OF ALL TIME!

Isayama you GOAT."
emmyeggo,Jdruu,Oh... oh my goodness.
emmyeggo,MLGameOver,Christ
emmyeggo,Charlie374,"You did an incredible job providing so much evidence

but holy shit i hope you're wrong"
Charlie374,AbbyAZK,"Given what happened in chapter 138 and how this perosn talked about Mikasa and Eren's relationship importance, holy heaven this guy has been spot on so far."
emmyeggo,Corsharkgaming,Its all Gothkasa's fetish fic.
emmyeggo,GensokyoIsReal,"holy.... shit

I literally thought of most of what's written here back in 2019, august 07, right as the Gothkasa and Nerdmin panel leaked. Holy crap I hope this is real"
emmyeggo,vngu123,"Hi I would like to add something to your theory, what do you think of the Lost Girls OVA? Where Mikasa resets time because of her desire for Eren to live? https://youtu.be/kLNgJeyEQgQ at 17:41 the mystery man says to Mikasa you arrived here because of your desire. Similar to how Eren created this world of destruction because he DESIRED IT."
emmyeggo,SubAtomic_Idiot,"Into my headcanon it goes~ 
But srsly, interesting theory."
emmyeggo,charlettesweb,"i hate this theory so much that i love it

good work!!"
emmyeggo,PattisLordu,I recommend reading Muv-Luv Alternative to all AoT fans. It is one of the best stories I have read in my life and there are too much similarities between two series
emmyeggo,Khamircia,"What if  Attack on School Castes in reality is the lost, ""forgotten 140 even number"" chapter?"
Khamircia,dresdennn,"Exactly, imagine if the final school castes chapter that is set to come out is '140' and the true epilogue involving the characters from this world's lives after waking back up in the AU world?"
emmyeggo,GensokyoIsReal,This would have been so much better
emmyeggo,PrestigeGrim,If only it was this.
emmyeggo,COMPIND,[This makes me think of this theory](https://imgur.com/jDwJIlI)
emmyeggo,mwmwmwmwmmdw,oh OP how much i wish this post was actually right but in the end it was very wrong
emmyeggo,ijustwannadielol,"This is very convincing, I‚Äôll give you that. However, to me there‚Äôs some parts of your theory that you‚Äôre taking out of context to fit your theory.

For example, when Armin talks about wanting to still believe that there is still a world out there that they don‚Äôt know about, he‚Äôs talking about the paths realm and the people still living in it. Same with the chapter 122, it is just hinting at the paths universe with the parasite.

Eren saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting an end to this world‚Äù means ending paths and thus the Titan curse and pure titans.

Mikasa telling Armin that he‚Äôs saved them before is referring to Armin telling Hannes about Mikasa and Eren needing rescue when Carla was crushed. 

Not trying to diss you on your theory, I really like it, but personally I wouldn‚Äôt bet money on it"
ijustwannadielol,emmyeggo,"They‚Äôre all good points :) 

Though I do disagree that I‚Äôm finding things to fit my theory - I‚Äôm not really about that and happy to be proven wrong. (A part of me actually hopes I‚Äôm wrong, bc I still want to be shocked at the final chapter lmao). 

Essentially, what I am getting at with this post is that I have a gut feeling that in whatever capacity, the universe we see in AOT is not singular. All the points I have presented don‚Äôt necessarily constitute concrete evidence, because if it was, everyone would be picking up on it and it wouldn‚Äôt be an effective reveal. Instead, what I am presenting are elements that I believe could be foreshadowing, so that if the AU theory did turn out to be true, that there would have been subtle hints for it from the start, and it wouldn‚Äôt just appear out of the blue.

So as you pointed out, yes, Armin talking about ‚Äòa world they don‚Äôt know about,‚Äô or Eren saying he‚Äôll ‚Äòput an end to this world,‚Äô could be taken literally. However, I‚Äôm saying that there‚Äôs also the possibility for it to double as foreshadowing. For example, we know in the anime that Reiner says to Eren (when training in the Survey Corps) ‚Äòokay, you be the bad guy next.‚Äô Yes, you could take that literally and understand Reiner was talking about the training, but now we realise that it was actually alluding to future events to come. I‚Äôm postulating that a similar thing could be happening here. :)"
emmyeggo,jddncb556,"My only real rebuttal here is that I think you're hung up on the use of ""this."" I wouldn't take it super literally, translations between languages aren't perfect and the meaning of words change depending on that language. ""This"" can be a term of specification or generality, same with ""the."" Are you going to eat the apple vs are you going to eat this apple. Functionally they mean the same thing even if one is implying more specificity.

&#x200B;

Additionally, I question how important the ""See you later Eren"" is considering the anime never adapted it. Otherwise, you've put a fascinating theory together that really works thematically, but only if the anime adapts the AUs in part 2, or they decide to end at 138 given you seem to think 138 is it for the universe we know."
emmyeggo,Sentohyugo,I really hope this is what is going to happen. Until now I had complete faith in Isayama but Chapter 138 made me fear of a shit ending.
emmyeggo,Zllls,Imagine the last chapter is an April fool and this is the joke
emmyeggo,eternalnocturnals,"Im kinda on a similar but different side of this theory, in that the gothkasa memory shard is from the future, where after the whole ragnarok ordeal, eren is sent to the other world as a sort of punishment, like in muv luv but also like in the eternal champion where the mc is also ""reincarnated in another world"" trope but i think in that story it's like a punishment of sorts, after a type of genocide"
emmyeggo,Miniminji,"Pretty sure sth like a parallel universe is gonna turn out, there are far too many evidences for it to not happen"
emmyeggo,jivebeaver,"im not gonna doubt you because at this point any theory is as good as another, and youve presented a decent case for it, but i will say that the benefit of following an idea is that you can pick and choose passages and interpretations that support it.  for instance, the distinction between ""This/The world"" could be minimal, or it could not if you were inclined to believe there was more to it.

i did suspect before that multiple universes could be at work.  my previous theory was that Eren would eat all nine titans (Armin included last), become the living embodiment of Ymir Fritz the founder, then send memories back thousands of years to the original Ymir before she made the deal with the devil, showing her the millennia of the cursed history of the eldian race and convincing her not to take the deal.  then he wakes up with everyone around him he knows in a world where titans never existed, and ""eldians"" are just humans.  im sure you could comb the chapters for supporting evidence if you tried

well as you can see that idea went to shit, so it could just be as simplistic was Eren trampling the rest of the world and leaving it all for the Paradisians.  or he wakes up in high school.  who knows, thats the fun of it"
emmyeggo,thealchemistry,Have you seen DARK on Netflix?
thealchemistry,emmyeggo,I haven't! Does it have similar themes? :)
emmyeggo,thealchemistry,The MC is also destroying their world of suffering.
emmyeggo,thealchemistry,Yes? If your into time travel/bootstrap paradox and alternate universe also it's a German series and AOT is set in Germany so idk if it's coincidence or not haha. I have the same theory as you but I'm not good with words so thank you for this sir!
emmyeggo,BlazePro,Please
emmyeggo,YaBoiDanish,"I really like how much evidence there is for this theory, though there are a few parts of this theory that kinda bother me:
1 In chapter 131, we can clearly see Eren temporarily being conflicted about if genociding the world really should be done. He even says that killing only the people inside the walls would result in less deaths than if he went full rumbling, but he quickly refutes that idea saying that he can't accept that. This to me seems like he does the rumbling for the sake of Paradis, not to fulfill his supposed 'mission' that'd take him back to the schoolverse. Also, what counts as destroying humanity? Only the people outside the walls? Shouldn't the walldians also count as humanity, thus needing to be destroyed?
2 Supposedly, Eren made the deal with Ymir in the schoolverse, but when? Eren does wish for a more entertaining world, but he never directly said it to Ymir. The only two times he met Ymir was seeing her while talking to Falco and Gabi and the other time was when Ymir told her how to save humanity(I might me misremembering this), which was cleaning yourself. There's no way Eren made the deal in any of these interactions. Also, he wished for it at first, but after getting an experience of something that is not as boring as his normal life(kidnapping), he clearly regrets it and even wishes he never thought about it. If Eren made the deal sometime after those 2 encounters with Ymir, it wouldn't make a licker of sense tbh.
Anyways, that's all I have to say. This theory is really wel made and I can clearly see how much effort went into this. Though, if I'm gonna be honest, I wouldn't like this ending, mainly because every person in SnK that isn't Eren had motivations and goals that in the end, amounted to nothing, as they were just born into a world purely meant for Eren to destroy it. I think this ending focuses too much on Eren alone. I'd like an ending that focuses on all the (surviving) main cast with all their arcs completed. You said something that with this theory, you can also add your other theory and it'd would perfectly fit, but imo, adding this theory on top of the actual end of the SnK world that we know of would strip of a lot of meaning and would make the world feel very empty. Anyways, those were just my two cents. English isn't native language."
emmyeggo,EDOD_EseDelOtroDia,It's good to see that someone other than me was able to understand the story.
emmyeggo,aDankSpazxtic,Well put together theory but if this is the actual ending I will cry lol
emmyeggo,throwawayyyyoo,Agreed with everything expect for eren being the father. It wouldn‚Äôt make sense for him to throw a fit about how he‚Äôs against it and then go on to impregnate historia
emmyeggo,jez124,"Props for a great theory even if nonsensical you made it work somewhat. I would love an alternate world ending not like yours per say but something like Paths,World Tree different world and eren getting a second chance in another world"
emmyeggo,XxMemeStar69xX,Dope
emmyeggo,Gabee_arts,I really like your theory! You did a great job üòÅ
emmyeggo,Liquid-N,I like it i'd be kinda glad if it ended that way
Legendver2,AbbyAZK,It is highly likely they can always make an anime for that reason or movie to connect both universes because I cannot see them finishing the anime in 16 episodes.
emmyeggo,Ixameh,"Very well put together theory, however:

1. ""This world vs the world"" could just be weird translating since the story is originally in japanese, and even an official translator might not know the secret meanings behind specific words

2. Why would paths Grisha want Zeke to stop Eren?"
emmyeggo,Hetzer5000,Great read I could nearly see this happening my only problem is that I believe the original shot of Armin and Mikasa is purely an Easter Egg as he has done things like put literal Pennywise in the background.
emmyeggo,Haunter1998,"139 - refers to Judas - the 13th apostle, also equal to the number of years a Titan shifter lives for.
Also, isn't it strange how all those who died reappear in a panel after the death of Hanje (132), what's the significance of that panel?"
emmyeggo,edwardblackwing,This was one hell of a read.
emmyeggo,Hantark,"For as much as this makes a lot of sense after reading through, I'm not sure I would enjoy an ending based on comedy mini-chapters/fillers which usually are meaningless towards the story... But again, one chapter left, so not a lot of time to wrap up, which solidifies this... I guess we'll wait and see!!!"
emmyeggo,gptamynk,"At this moment..I don't know what to think or feel ..If it's true 
It's either the most genius move in history or just shit post of century in literature history, present and past"
emmyeggo,HamidKingBros,"I agree with the alternate universe, but I have another idea. What about this?

There is another alternate universe where Eren and Mikasa actually abandon all their friends and let Paradise island be destroyed by Marley as seen in the last chapter. What if this specific Eren sent his memories to the Eren from our world and also maybe the same thing for Mikasa, and then traveled here?

This also explains the weird footages of ''Future Eren'' [in the anime](https://preview.redd.it/l4dmp71ubcu51.jpg?auto=webp&s=229c1f10edac09dd39bf2021fd459e82a3d4871e).

And this also explains why at the beginning, Eren says that he had woken up from a LONG dream.

What about it?"
emmyeggo,CREEEEEEEEED,"I hope it's true. Not because it would be a good ending, because it would be awful. Imagine the balls isayama would have to take a great manga and so thoroughly ruin it at the very very very last second. Just to shit on the world from up high and laugh at our sorrow."
emmyeggo,Bebop723,Reading this make me feel like falling into sea of happiness
emmyeggo,MangoeCos,"I've been sharing this with all of my manga-current friends, its absolutely enthralling and so well put together! Thank you for posting! Honestly this is now where my bets are placed too :)"
emmyeggo,Ayax_407,It would be a huge XD
emmyeggo,Weewer,):
emmyeggo,stellahajime,"the new leaks kinda confirming this theory or at least going into the School Castes being canon, damn you really did THAT"
emmyeggo,HOODIEBABA,AU is canon..you called it. Great stuff.
emmyeggo,pyloves2eat,"Wow. I‚Äôm blown away with your take on the possible ending, and I don‚Äôt hate it tbh. I agree with you it‚Äôs impossible to have all to be satisfied with the ending, and I‚Äôm one who don‚Äôt mind this simply because of selfish reason- I want Eren to live. 

Let‚Äôs just go by your theory, I have a few of questions though; 

1) So did Eren and friends travelled to the alternate universe with him or is it just him? 

2) Why and how did he travel? He just made it happen because he wished for something to happen? 

3) Why must Eren fathered Historia‚Äôs baby? He definitely doesn‚Äôt like/love her, so I concluded if he is the father, there has to be a reason for that choice. What is that reason if what you‚Äôre hypothesising is correct?

I‚Äôd be thrilled if you can clear my doubts. üòÅ
Thanks once again, I thoroughly enjoyed the read. üòä"
pyloves2eat,danielredmayne,"Not OP but my interpretation is:

1) Everyone, but I wouldn't they say travelled, rather Ymir converted the entire world according to Eren's wish. 

2) When Eren made that wish with Ymir, the (modern) world is converted into the Titan world. No one is aware of it, but Eren slowly regained his memories about the old world when he touched Historia's hands. 

3) He could simply fell in love with Titan world's version of Historia, while in the original world he  loves Mikasa. This might be a parallel for Grisha's life in the Titan world, marrying two different people from different places. In Eren's case, he loves two different people from different worlds. As Zeke said, ""No one could blame you for forgetting your old family to enjoy a happy life"" (paraphrasing). This might be an intentional hint by Isayama."
danielredmayne,pyloves2eat,"Thanks for the clarification!

So is Ymir supposed to be the devil/fairy godmother kind of person to grant that wish to Eren? Let‚Äôs just say, your theory is true, what‚Äôs with the Ymir backstory then?

This is the part I find it hard to stomach, because till now, I honestly don‚Äôt see evidence hinting that Eren came to love Historia and fathered a child with her. At least from my point of view, his heart seems to be for Mikasa rather than Historia. If the baby is really his, it has to be for other reasons other than love. Then what‚Äôs with all those moments and hints with Mikasa then? So yeah, I‚Äôll find it hard to accept. But if that‚Äôs the way that they‚Äôll ultimately IRL not die...I guess I can make do with it. *I still prefer to not have a EH baby. Still.*"
pyloves2eat,emmyeggo,"Thanks so much! I am going to answer your questions on the assumption that this theory is correct (and I definitely acknowledge that it may not be). 

1. I assume it would be all the characters that are also featured in the Attack on School Castes (which is most of the main ones). 
2. If this theory is true, this would be the one thing Isayama would need to reveal/clarify. However, I believe it would involve Ymir and Eren making a deal in the previous universe (which is what is represented in those paintings of Ymir and the 'Devil' making a similar deal; which we still have no real clue what these paintings are about, considering Ymir actually got her Titan powers from a unidentified organism in a tree). 
3. I don't think they would need to be in love - in fact, that might cement this theory even further (considering the parallels I mentioned about Grisha/Dina and Eren/Historia and not being 'free'). It's actually pretty interesting because in the School Castes previews, there's a panel where Historia mentions 'Eren lied to keep me safe,' and we haven't heard from Historia at all since Chapter 90- so I think there's is definitely something going on w Historia and Eren (baby or not - but the baby would work well for this theory). That being said, the alternate universe theory can still stand without the Eren/Historia/Mikasa ending. 

\*Also, now that I think of it (in relation to your question 3), in one of the Muv Luv endings, the main character and his pregnant girlfriend are the only ones to survive in one of the alternate universes. Perhaps this is a further nod to the Eren/Historia ending (before going to the next world?)"
emmyeggo,pyloves2eat,"Hello! 

Appreciate you responding to my questions. Very interesting and you‚Äôve just fuelled my desire and desperation to learn the ending even more. This is so torturing!! I really enjoyed and can‚Äôt help but be impressed with you validating your points in this hypothesis. 

I don‚Äôt deny that the possibility of EH baby is there. It‚Äôll be a little lame if it turns out to be just nothing but red herring. But...but...I still don‚Äôt want that though, cos at least from what‚Äôs revealed so far, it‚Äôll be an out-of-character decision for Eren the way I see it. He didn‚Äôt want to recognise Mikasa‚Äôs feelings because he only had 4 years left, yet he could father a child with Historia? Moreover, like I said, I‚Äôm still not convinced that there are circumstances for the duo to have a kid to happen. I guess we‚Äôll know more after C137. 

I‚Äôm not familiar with Muv Luv, but are you saying that the ending of that anime/manga further cements a possible ending for EH in the AoT universe? Ok but ‚òπÔ∏è

I‚Äôve actually tried to find some traces of possible endings by watching AoT live action movies. Because Isayama said that despite it being a standalone story, the movie will have elements from the original manga. It may not be anything but the movie did end with Eren and Mikasa looking on to the world that they had discovered after scaling the wall. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

emmyeggo,death_to_the_state,"Bro that's the same as the main character waking up in the end it was just a dream all along type of ending. Would be super lame if he did that, but even this is better than the Guardians of the Galaxy ending we are getting."
emmyeggo,Malyar_Feyzullah,"About the miner story, the miner did not dig that hole for 20 years, he was a miner for 20 years. It probably took him just a few days to dig that hole."
Malyar_Feyzullah,emmyeggo,"Good pick up. I'm realising now I may have been too hopeful with the miner story (though it could still foreshadow the ending; ie the characters vanishing). Regardless, I think (hope) the theory still stands without the miner story anyway."
emmyeggo,FlubsDubz,So you're saying AoT all this time is an isekai?
emmyeggo,akatsuki_w9,"This is the same as ending Harry Potter with ""then Harry woke up"""
emmyeggo,ayushp20,You are gonna lose those $500. Interesting theory though.
emmyeggo,phantom_97,"Appreciate the effort OP, but this is the worst possible ending in my eyes, I would even prefer the manga ending right here on 137 than endure this. It basically amounts to ""it was all a dream!"", negating basically the entire plot and all character growth in the entire series. No one gives a fuck about some random high school AU, shoehorning a light hearted, comedy AU into the main story is unbelievably stupid for a story imo."
phantom_97,Joet2386,Actually it doesn't look at Muv Luv and the Eternal Champion
emmyeggo,Joet2386,"I agree with your opinion and if Eren does indeed restart the rumbling, this would be the only ending that appease both sides."
emmyeggo,Frixeeen,"Holy shit you made me not take the story ""serious"" anymore.."
emmyeggo,TheKingOfRooks,Man the anime onlies would be so fucking confused lmao
emmyeggo,Pressure_Chemical,"this ending... would make everything quite a bit less epic than what it seems to be right now but I think... I wouldn't mind it? it makes everything a bit simpler but I guess that would be the actual point, to escape all the complicated shit in the SnK AU for a simpler life... 

I do find it interesting how Eren would then be some sort Haruhi Suzumiya type of god/center of the universe type being. Absolute control and completely unaware of i. Except instead of a god in the traditional, malevolent, sense he's more of a god of destruction? Not only that but it'd kinda make since with his devil schema thing going on... In this theory,  as soon as he's born, the universe is doomed to end because of him being unsatisfied. So in a since he'd sort of be a tragic *anti-christ*. 

Forever trapped in a cycle of being unfulfilled with how his life is and wishing for the opposite (wishing for action in castes, then for peace in SnK), unable to see that while his grass might not be green, the grass on the other side isnt either. As well as dooming everyone around him to suffer with whatever path he takes (leaving behind a quiet, simple life in castes -> having to suffer in SnK, working hard to make that universe better, only to have that hard work amount to nothing when a universe will be started anyways -> rinse, repeat).

Specially Mikasa, if this theory is true, forever stuck in eren's pull until the painful end/start, like a star that too close to a black hole lol"
emmyeggo,MightyCup,"HOLY FUCK! I wasn‚Äôt really buying the theory at first but shit, I‚Äôm in. I still don‚Äôt know how I feel about eren, mikasa and historia... Kinda like historia and eren not gunna lie. But fuck it, let‚Äôs see where we go"
MightyCup,emmyeggo,"I guess that's the beauty of this theory - Eren technically ends up with both Mikasa and Historia (which parallels with Grisha, as well as the plot of Muv Luv!)."
emmyeggo,MightyCup,"I suppose so, I do think it‚Äôs interesting. I still think that Historia is the better one to end up with but that‚Äôs just me personally. I don‚Äôt mind either or both lmao! Honestly, eren‚Äôs probably lucky enough to have his own haram if he wanted lol"
emmyeggo,marumashu,Nah
emmyeggo,AFellow_2003,"About the usage of ""this world"".

Even though technically, it's redundant to say ""this world"" if only one exists, I don't think it necessarily has a second meaning. For a man who's too old and weary to perform a physical feat, I can see them saying ""this body's too weak"", even if that man doesn't have 20 backup bodies in his cellar."
AFellow_2003,emmyeggo,"True! This theory I have presented is kind of founded on the basis that a lot of this evidence is actually kind of circumstantial and really subtle - so it could go either way. However, it also leaves open the possibility for this theory to work, and if it did, all of these subtleties would then act as foreshadowing - so it's really cool in that sense. 

For example, if Eren said 'I will destroy THE world,' then it kind of dilutes this alternate universe theory, but because he said 'I will destroy THIS world,' it leaves room for the **possibility**."
emmyeggo,ATOMate,"So after reading all this I wanna give my thought. Firstly I wanna commend you for doing this.  

The panel with the shard memories is indeed interesting. Even with his comment of wanting to link the school universe to the current one, I could still very much see this being just an easter egg-manga panel could still just be an easter egg.

You touch on the fact that Eren and Mikasa specifically talk about ""this world"" and not just ""the world"". I honestly do not see much of anything in there. Saying ""this world"" is reasonable and in the context of sounding dramatic it is a perfectly viable choice of words.

The fact that Eren can alter memories of past Attack Titan users does not imply the existence of alternate universes in my opinion. I see AoT as the type of story, where every alteration of the past has already happened and was always destined to happen. This allows the story to still be within one singular timeline and have no branches. A story that can branch off often feels pointless because one timeline will always be saved and another is probably doomed.  Multiple timelines of the same universe significantly lower the impact of everything that happens in one timeline. From a story telling perspective it is a huge risk to go down that route. So I really do believe that AoT does not jump timelines when Eren alters the past.

Another point I wanna touch upon is Historias baby. If we do in fact jump to an alternate reality in the end, I do not see that Historias baby story line going anywhere. It'd be a lose end to me. You mentioned the parallel to Grisha, of Eren getting a second chance in said alternate reality with Mikasa. But I just don't see tat working out, the mini cliffhanger of Historias baby would be abandoned and not feel satisfying to me. Maybe some extra scenes with her could fix this minor issue I have, but I do not quite see that happening.

The image of Ymir and the Devil looks quite significant. But is it really? I tried to find the scene of the anime where it was shown, but I couldn't find it. I remember this scene being used to explain the origins of the titan and Ymir. (Somewhere around the end of season 3 I think) Again, this based on my memory alone. Was this not used as the explanation to how Ymir got her original titan powers? ""A deal with the devil"" This was mere specualtion. No one except Ymir, and now probably Eren, knew how Ymir got her powers. So it was just assumed that it must have been a deal with a devil. This picture does not necessarily reflect reality. Gotta check that scene again, to confirm this though

&#x200B;

What I do find very interesting are the opening and ending lyrics. My god, they are just way too specific to not mean anything. We did have the entire Ymir story in the Season 2 ending after all. These things aren't just songs with funny pictures. So I do believe Isayama defintely wants the school universe to be part of his story line. 

Now having said that, I do think that it is possible that the school universe will not be part of the main manga story line. It could be type of thing we speculate about for years to come. Leaving some things to be interpreted and analysed sounds like the Isayama thing to do to me. 

I will definitely keep on thinking about this theory lol"
ATOMate,InformalPresent1,"I know my reasoning might be very stupid, but the thing is...if Isayama wanted the ending to be like this, wouldn't he include this high school AU in the anime? I don't know how many people read this thing. If this is how the ending was always supposed to be (and¬† I believe Isayama planned everything), shouldn't he have included more clues? All this evidence is very circumstantial."
InformalPresent1,ATOMate,"That is a good point. Yes! 

AoT usually excels in big, world changing reveals, to which the reader/viewer already had all the puzzle pieces. Because of this the reader cannot possibly imagine any other truth besides the one that was presented to him. That is what's so special about a good reveal. Everything falls into place and you go ""Ohhhhh of course! That makes sense! Why didn't I think of that?!""

Turning the show into an Isekai in the last episode would be the exact opposite of that."
emmyeggo,jccadiz,Yams is gonna pull a Shinji on us god damnit
emmyeggo,advidgelan, What if it went the other way around? this alternate universe is an imagination
emmyeggo,Limp_Summer_5047,"What an amazing theory! I just saw Volume 34‚Äôs fake preview. I think Isayama added an extra page. I‚Äôll link it down below. What do you think of it? Do you think there‚Äôs any correlation between your theory and the last thing Eren says and the 4th step, ‚ÄúTotonou‚Äù (meaning to put to order, I think)? 

https://imgur.com/a/vgtoh1T"
Limp_Summer_5047,emmyeggo,"Thanks so much! 

Potentially yeah, what a great pick up! Won't lie though, that sauna scene really confused me hahah, and it kind of felt like a misdirection/red herring? I'm keen to see what will be next!"
emmyeggo,soroopi,"If aot would end like this, I think it would be a disappointment (well, for me) especially because i have high hopes for Mr. Isayama. Honestly, I would rather aot have a tragic ending where everyone would die just like in AnR (i have fucking accepted that shit) and eren living his life with pain and regrets. But after learning about this, i dont know anymore. I want aot to have a happy ending but i think a tragic one is better. Either way, i just hope mr isayama wraps aot in a satisfying manner 

Great theory btw :))"
emmyeggo,whatisgoingonpeople,"I really enjoyed reading about this theory, however I would be disappointed if it happened. I am unsure if someone will end up reading my comment here, but I found few things that did not add up to this theory. Here they come:

1) As we all know, Armin is the narrator of the story. If he were to go back to the AU, he would forget all about what happened. So, how come he still remembers the events of the Attack on Titan world?? I know some may argue that he will sacrifice himself and stay in the AOT world, but that does not make sense... Armin was always a character that looks for peace. He wants to be able to live in peace and harmony with people from all around the world. This theory would COMPLETELY RUIN all the hardship Armin went through to achieve piece. YES, HE WENT THROUGH HARDSHIP, it is really hard to keep that peaceful mentality in a world filled with hatred and suffering.

2) As I understood from the theory, the part with kids in Uniform is supposedly to be in the AU. Well, I do not think this is the case. If you actually pay attention to colours used in that scene, you will be able to see a yellowish flash, which is the same flash that appears during the transformation to a titan. I have a theory for this scene, maybe the world ends up living in piece with the Eldians. The part where the flash appears, a girl had a really shocked expression on her face (because she saw a human transforming into a titan??). Also on their Uniform, there is a fallen bird symbol, which appeared in S4 opening (My War). I think this is a symbolism to honour the ""fallen"" or people who have sacrificed themselves in order to achieve the peace the world is in right now. 

That is all of what came up to my mind reading this theory for now... 

I tried to make my point short and sweet, but apparently I have written a mini essay. Thank you for reading up to this point."
whatisgoingonpeople,emmyeggo,"These are all really great points - thank you for taking the time to read my post and leave your thoughts! :) I‚Äôll answer these comments from the perspective that my theory is correct, though I am definitely aware that it could very well not be. 

1. You are very right about Armin‚Äôs character. However, ever since the very early chapters of the manga, it‚Äôs been hinted time and time again that although Armin will be the ‚Äòsaviour‚Äô of humanity, he will ‚Äòhave to throw away what‚Äôs dear to him.‚Äô I wish I could post photos in the comments, but I have saved a number of panels where Armin says similar things, such as ‚ÄòWhat else do I need to throw away to change things? My life, and what else do I need to leave behind?‚Äô This is something that Erwin also said; and just as Erwin gave up on his dream and died for the better good, I predict Armin will also make a similar sacrifice. I also think this is why Isayama has coupled him up with Annie romantically. Isayama doesn‚Äôt tend to do romance/relationships unless for a reason, and I think having Armin in love with Annie, but being forced to stay behind in the current universe and ‚Äòthrow everything away‚Äô would make this utterly heartbreaking. This is just speculation, though. It could go another way, and maybe Armin does leave and Eren is sacrificed and forced to stay behind. 

2. That‚Äôs a really good observation. The only problem with this, is that if this image is of the Tybur children aged up (7-10 years or so), then the last panel couldn‚Äôt be of Eren holding his and Historia‚Äôs child, because that would mean the story would end (in the AOT universe) a few months from now; however, the Tybur children have aged 5-10 years... so that won‚Äôt work (and Eren‚Äôs child also would have similarly aged 5-10 years). You‚Äôre also right about the symbol, I noticed that too. However, if you look at the lyrics of the S4 opening, My War, it‚Äôs about students in a classroom. The cover for this song (on Spotify) is also of a modern day classroom. ü§î"
emmyeggo,kiwi-not-pewee,"wait how can you tell that the person in the final panel has a beard, I thought his back was turned away from the viewer."
emmyeggo,bigkawaii,Does this mean AOT will be an isekai ??)

emmyeggo,plsc1994brazil,"MFW Mikasa was Sumika all along, and Historia was Eren Noble Confidant"
emmyeggo,miuruu,Could the map of the world in SNK [SNK world map upside down](https://images.app.goo.gl/7EFYBPVCYUVm2i7Z8) ‚Äî if you turn it upside down reveals that Paradis is located in Madagascar ‚Äî be a clue that indeed there is another world (reality)? That the wall (from the miner's story) from underground when turned upside down would be another wall from the other world? I honestly don't want this to be the case tho. An alternate universe/reality sort of ruins it for me. But maybe Isayama could pull it off w/o being cringey and cliche.
emmyeggo,AllThingsFanArt,commenting incase this turns out to be true !
emmyeggo,Grantg543,"Hello, this theory was from awhile ago but a question randomly popped up in my head about it. I would love this ending actually, but am not sure about this part:

How would this theory connect to eren‚Äôs encounter with ymir in paths? Ymir seems to be a slave to fritz and stays with him because she‚Äôs connected to the world, and eren understood that and gave her freedom to choose to end this world or stay in it for eternity. It freed her and showed her true human interaction for the first time.

If she‚Äôs the one that created the world under Eren‚Äôs wish, why would there be this connection? If it was pure suffering, would she not resent eren for the deal, and how does it connect to sending eren a message 2k years later for him to free her?

Thanks!"
Grantg543,yaujj36,"I say the devil who ‚Äúcreated‚Äù AoT world is King Fritz himself. Ymir is merely a tool to make sure Eren‚Äôs dream is fulfilled by setting up plot points (Ymir eating Marcel, the Santa Titan, etc).

I guess if Ymir help Eren, in exchange she will be free."
emmyeggo,walkingplothole,"Well... I never read the manga or watched the anime, I don\`t even know how I got here in the first place. But this theory of yours is so interesting that I might actually start reading it. Very well researched, presented with compelling evidence... I miss being part of a fandom like this."

emmyeggo,SophisticatedTitan,"It doesn't feel like AoT at all, but I really appreciate the research that went into this. I don't know if anyone else with my opinion gave their two cents on why they think so, so allow me to put in mine.

If this ends up being true, all the suffering and losses in the original AoT universe would be for nothing, because it would be a ""fictional"" world created by a bored highschooler. It would devalue a lot of things, such as Erwin's sacrifice, Armin's sacrifice, all the Survey Corps members who died trying to save Eren multiple times, etc. I personally wouldn't want such an ending, but rather one where all these trials and tribulations are repaid by a true new beginning - one that will be started by Historia's newborn child. A world where titans and Subjects of Ymir don't exist. Only humans and their flawed nature."
emmyeggo,Denise107363,"About Mikasa saying she saw that scene over and over again, she had a flashback about her dad coming back from a haunt, saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a cruel world‚Äù or something like that. Interesting theory tho"

emmyeggo,Imperivm97,"This theory is so credible that I'm already believing it and (sadly) hating Isayama as a consequence. I'm not even gonna bother with the last chapter, I'm already in pain for it, and I'll just pretend that AOT ended with chapter 138.

I can't believe that Isayama was gonna do this the whole time, yet now I can't unbelieve it.

I guess, thank you for uncovering the truth with this theory, it probably would have killed me to read the final chapter with no expectations of that coming."

emmyeggo,DarkyyDmage,nah
emmyeggo,Gimmethat720,This would be such a terrible ending.
emmyeggo,Faulky1x,"TBH I think this is the most realistic ending theory we have purely down to the Knowledge we have Right now the hints that you have found perfectly linking the 2 Stories and the amount of chapters left now I think if Isayama was to end it on someone winning the war I think 1 of the main 3 characters would have to be killed to make that a good ending and you know if it‚Äôs eren that dies his death and Explanation could potentially take up to an entire chapter by itself and then what only 1 chapter left to show the entire aftermath, potential peace treaty Historias child and close out the series in a good way not a chance that gets done unless extremely rushed and as much as I don‚Äôt want a time travel ending as much as the next guy/girl with only 2 chapters left it wouldn‚Äôt be hard for us to witness them leave in chapter 138 and get an explanation on what happens and then in 139 get a tour of the new world and close out the series in a nice way. And you never know all this could lead to a Sequel of AOT and I‚Äôm pretty sure we would all love that"
emmyeggo,EldianTitanShifter,">This is an image that was shown during the Season 3 ending scene. Many have suspected that these are the young Tybur children in a few years time. However, given the current fashion trends seen in Attack on Titan, these uniforms seen far too modern. So instead, could this foreshadow the Tybur children in the alternate universe (which we know is set in the 21st century?)

I doubt it. Seems to be an old concept of maybe a young Gabi training and being educated to be a Warrior Candidate. If these are Tybur kids... how is there so many?? No way."
EldianTitanShifter,emmyeggo,This [comparison](https://imgur.com/MOum5Da) on the right shows how they are the Tybur kids (the Tybur children are the 4 in the front row).

emmyeggo,Michtli,"Good job on bringing this theory to us, and I appreciate all the evidence, how ever ...
If the shard of memory (castes AU) that Eren sees is so important for the development of the ending then i have a couple of questions...

1. Why Isayama did not introduce the AU in the first chapters of the manga to familiarize the readers to it

2. Why didn't he introduce the AU within the main story and not at the end of every volume?

3. why we haven't seen anything related to the AU in the anime.

4. If the fragment of AU (armin and mikasa) is important then shouldn't it be bigger and more centrally located on the page instead of being tiny and in a corner?

5. Explain to us the existence of Ymir as a God in the AU and why it seems that Eren is the only one who can see her?

6. In the AU why would Ymir make Eren wish of destroying the world¬† come true in the first place? What does she gain from doing so? 

These are my doubts regarding your theory,, i'm genuinely asking def not trying to send hate or something. Sorry if my english doesn't make sense it's not my first language"
Michtli,emmyeggo,"Thanks for reading! :) To answer your questions: 

1. Isayama may not have introduced the School Castes AU from the start, but there were already hints of alternate universe content (such as AOT Junior High, Lost Girls OVA).

2. If Isayama introduced the AU within the main story, that would spoil the plot twist at the end (if this theory is correct). He has already hinted at alternate worlds being possible, however, such as the evidence I presented in the main post. 

3. If the School Castes are going to be animated (perhaps as apart of an ending song), then because there are only 10 of them, I imagine they will not be animated until Season 4, Part 2. There have also been extra ‚Äòhints‚Äô added into the anime that weren‚Äôt in the manga, especially as seen in the openings/endings (such as the Tybur children wearing the modern school uniform). In fact, if you take a look at the ending of Season 3, Episode 12, you‚Äôll see something very odd about that üò≥ 

4. As mentioned previously, if Isayama put the Goth Mikasa/Nerd Armin memory shard in the focus of the page, it would be too obvious and spoil the plot twist. The fact that it‚Äôs hidden actually makes it even more suspicious, if you ask me. 

5. The School Castes just details that Ymir is worshipped as a ‚ÄòGod,‚Äô and Eren is her ‚Äòmessenger,‚Äô and is the only one who can actually see her. The other characters (Zeke, Yelena) pick up on this, and worship Eren because he will ‚Äòsave‚Äô them. It‚Äôs implied that Ymir has a ‚Äòmessage‚Äô to save humanity, but we‚Äôre not sure if that‚Äôs a joke/misdirection as of yet. Additionally, despite everyone else in the School Castes AU wearing different clothes (that are more modern), Ymir Fritz looks the exact same. It makes me wonder if Paths is the connection between worlds, and Ymir wants to live normally but cannot. So far, that‚Äôs all we know. 

6. That‚Äôs the one thing I am yet to figure out - if Ymir made this deal, what would she get out of it? We know as of Chapter 137 that she‚Äôs after ‚Äòconnection,‚Äô but her motivations are still unclear. Perhaps it wasn‚Äôt a deal, and she was forced to undertake commands once again. As a side note, Eren and Ymir making a deal is somewhat of a guess- an alternate universe ending could still exist without this being the case (and an alternate universe ending can still exist without the connection to School Castes, I should add, but this is just how I put the puzzle pieces together)."
emmyeggo,Anaviocla,"I don't think this will happen, but it was still a great read anyway!"
emmyeggo,Yippikokoxiao,I‚Äôm not sure if this had been mentioned or not but wouldn‚Äôt the Attack on caste AU be totally out of nowhere for the anime onlies?
Yippikokoxiao,emmyeggo,"There‚Äôs only 10 school caste previews, so even if they were to be animated (perhaps as apart of the ending theme) they wouldn‚Äôt be included until Season 4, Part 2. 

This theory also draws most of the evidence from the anime/manga main story - the School Castes is just a ‚Äòbonus‚Äô piece of the puzzle (and an alternate world ending could still be possible without it)."
emmyeggo,51622002," And if the last panel of manga 139 is actually from the AU hospital where adult gothic Mikasa gave birth to her and Eren's child after they all return from the SnK universe, and it is Eren who is holding her newborn son telling her that He is free because he was just born, in parallel with the fact that Eren was fighting for the freedom that he did not have because according to him, he was born in this world*üì∑*"
emmyeggo,Open-Abbreviations87,"it's just easter eggs. don't take it seriously, you know?

emmyeggo,Aslan_Callenreese,"I think the 20 year thing is a bit of a stretch. Canonicaly it's the year 854, we know he's 19 so it has to be after March.

Considering the manga started being published in 2009."
Aslan_Callenreese,emmyeggo,"Yeah I agree, which is why I mentioned it was more of a symbolic 'thing.' I may have been a bit hopeful about the miner story, and it's not really needed to cement this theory - but the 'vanishing without a trace' is certainly interesting.

That's why I'm still solid on the Project Arms ending."
Movhan,ErwinSmith_GOAT,"The final panel could still show up in an AU ending like if Eren has retained memories from AOT, has a child, and tells them ""You are free"" in recognition that the child is born into a free world instead of AOT."
Movhan,emmyeggo,">The theory makes a lot of sense, but the one reason I don't believe it is because I contradicts the ""Omae wa Jiyuu Da"" final panel Yams spoilered for us three years ago.

I have included an explanation for this final panel; where I contrast the parallels between Grisha and Eren's romantic interests."
emmyeggo,Bitchesa_ng_taon03,After reading this I'm all just WTF IS THI SHIT? üòÇ
emmyeggo,Joet2386,"That's a good point. Besides even if the timeline is a fixed one, the Paths transcend time and space."
emmyeggo,dancerslave,imagine you're wrong lol
emmyeggo,Faustaire,"I'm going to come back and laugh at this when the series ends. You're clearly cheery picking information to fit your theory while ignoring the facts. Like how Kruger, the Attack Titan who let Grisha eat him, mentioned Mikasa and Armin who didn't even exist. Some people already theorized something relating to time like the connection the titans/Eldians have can transcend time itself. 

And do you know people say ""this world"" for several reason like for emphasis or because ""the world"" comes off as awkward?

Since you wrote so much, some parts of your theory may come true and/or have similarities to the actual ending so you would make yourself feel better by saying ""I was at least right about this"".

You need to learn parsimony. Which is the simplest answer is usually the correct one.

You should also know that some translations can be off.

I just find it annoying when people do ""research"" that's just confirmation bias and don't even bother to dispute themselves just for the sake of not wanting to be wrong."
Faustaire,emmyeggo,"Hello. You are welcome to come back and laugh, if that‚Äôs how you choose to spend your time. 

You are similarly entitled to your opinion, but I can assert very strongly that I have not ‚Äòcherry picked.‚Äô As I mentioned at the beginning of the post, I re-read the manga with this theory in mind to either prove or DISPROVE it. I am not wanting this theory to be correct, nor am I seeking validation. I am not sure if this overtly dramatic response is a projection of yourself, but you do not know me, so to assume I wrote this much because I ‚Äòwant to be right,‚Äô is short-sighted and unfounded. I am happy to be proven wrong if people can put forward evidence that counters what I have first presented. 

However, what you have commented doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòdisprove,‚Äô or ‚Äòcounter‚Äô anything. What you have failed to realise is that the points in my post aren‚Äôt necessarily classed as ‚Äòevidence,‚Äô but rather subtle clues I have discovered that could double as foreshadowing if this theory were to be revealed as true. If clues were clear and ‚Äòfactual,‚Äô as you put it, then every reader would be picking up on them, and it would then destroy the chances of presenting an effective and shocking plot twist at the end.

As further proof of this, cast your mind back to S1E4 of the anime, where Reiner said to Eren, ‚Äòyou play the bad guy next.‚Äô Yes, people like you can interpret that literally and suggest that Reiner is simply talking about the training task at hand. However, as we know, this comment had a double meaning that alluded to a future event yet to happen (and this is just one example of many). I am hypothesising that a similar thing is happening once again, which is why, for example, characters such as Eren say ‚ÄòTHIS‚Äô world, rather than ‚ÄòTHE‚Äô world (and as a side note on this, I have checked all translations for these points I made; you can check that for yourself in the comments). 

Secondly, I really have no idea as to the point you are trying to make about Eren Kruger. I am well aware the Attack Titan can ‚Äòtranscend time,‚Äô which is why it is possible that Eren would hear Kruger‚Äôs words in a future memory flashback; and would serve as a  reminder to complete the mission to ‚Äòsave Armin and Mikasa.‚Äô 

Thirdly, in regards to your comments about parsimony; you have presented me with a lose lose situation. If I present too much evidence, I‚Äôm told, by people like you, that ‚Äòthe simplest answer is the correct one;‚Äô but then if I present too little evidence, I‚Äôm told that there isn‚Äôt anything to back up my claims. For what it‚Äôs worth, the post I made is actually a SIMPLIFIED version of everything I found when re-reading the manga and conducting a more thorough analysis. 

Finally, if you want to claim that I am ‚Äòcherry picking‚Äô or displaying ‚Äòconfirmation bias,‚Äô then I could say the same thing to you with this comment; you have focused on one or two minor things that you believed to debunk my theory, but failed to recognise all the points that could actually be valid and work. So, if you‚Äôre so certain I am wrong, then how else would you explain Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin in Eren‚Äôs past memory shards, when Isayama himself said the School Castes was connected to the main story? How else would you explain Ymir Fritz similarly appearing in Eren‚Äôs past memory shards, when he hadn‚Äôt met her yet? How else do you explain the image of the aged up Tybur children wearing a modern school uniform? How else do you explain the S4 opening song being about ‚Äòschool‚Äô and the cover art being of a modern classroom, when school has had literally 0 bearing on the AOT story thus far?"
emmyeggo,Positive-Reindeer-91,"This is such a garbage theory with no understanding of Muv Luv or AoT as stories. The moment you learned about how Muv Luv ends you should have backed the hell out, because Takerus and Erens journey are completely different, youve done yourself nothing but a disservice by looking at a few plot details on a wiki or something and not actually reading the VN.
The school thing is a nice cute thing Isayama did, putting his kids into his own Muv Luv Extra that reflects what the characters would be like in a no conflict world, and you turned into bastardized Muv Luv without understanding the story of Muv Luv, and frankly not understanding AoT to come up with this garbage."

emmyeggo,NeroIntegrate,"I love your theory!

Just a question though, what are you basing the THIS world instead of THE world on? Afaik in Japanese they don't have a way of saying THE world, and most of the time they will say ""kono sekai"" which translates directly to THIS world, but it doesn't necessarily hold the meaning of the English THIS, simply because they don't have a way of saying it differently, which might be misleading since you have emphasized this particular point quite a bit.

Did you take it into account, or are you basing it on the translations alone?"
NeroIntegrate,danielredmayne,"I guess it's better for a Japanese speaker to answer that. I tried to use Google translate, it seems that the difference is the word 'kono' will be added if it's ""this world"" (kono sekai), while no word will be added for ""the world"" (sekai).

Eg:

1) Watashi wa kono sekai ni umaremashita.
 = I was born into *this* world.

2) Watashi wa sekai ni umaremashita.
 = I was born into *the* world."

It‚Äôs actually interesting bc even though Falco appeared to wake up from a strange dream in Chp 91, the mention of him ‚Äòflying around with swords‚Äô was only added to the anime. I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôre adding all this extra foreshadowing bc they can‚Äôt animate the School Castes? (The image of the school children in modern uniforms was also only added to the anime).

emmyeggo,Joet2386,How do you feel about this theory after Chapter 137 out of curiosity?
Joet2386,emmyeggo,"Good question! (I‚Äôll actually update the original post later w each chapter to see if the theory is still feasible or not). 
 
But I think it‚Äôs still looking good (?) There were a few things that caught my eye that could be related to this theory:
‚Ä¢ Before Zeke died, he spoke about ‚Äòjust wanting to play catch again‚Äô and ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt mind being born again.‚Äô 
‚Ä¢ There was also mention of Ymir being ‚Äòattached to a world she left behind, and Eren understood that.‚Äô 
‚Ä¢ Zeke also talks about ‚Äòmaybe the end of your days being manipulated, is freedom.‚Äô 
‚Ä¢ There was imagery of Armin, Mikasa and Eren heading back to the tree seen in Chapter 1 (where those leaves that Armin picked up were prominent)."
emmyeggo,Joet2386,WOW.
emmyeggo,Ittehad_Islam_Antor,This theory makes much more sense tbh.I'd love to see it tho many people will hate it.People thinking this will just be a happy ending but it could be that those who died can't comeback here.And no one will remember what happened.Maybe the current universe will keep on going but without Eren and some other characters.Who knows! And yeah I'd love to watch Mikasa and Eren ending up together.Good job man.
emmyeggo,rosa_lbr,"Hi! Just read your theory and I find it really interesting. I have just one question, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve already answer this but: does you have an explanation to the mikasa‚Äôs headaches? Because it happens quite frequently in the series and I am very curious about it"
rosa_lbr,emmyeggo,"Yes good question! I actually realised last night that there‚Äôs something odd about Mikasa‚Äôs headaches and mention of seeing Eren die ‚Äòagain and again.‚Äô She also only seems to have those headaches when Eren is in danger, something is definitely up with that. So I‚Äôm currently re-reading the manga from scratch and annotating everything until I figure it out, especially what‚Äôs going on with Mikasa and a possible loop (?) hahaha. If I find anything, I‚Äôll comment again! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
emmyeggo,Wyyynt,"I don't know if it's really that important.. many times when mikasa thinks about eren, the moment when he's saving her, she has this headaches. Chapter 6 Look at the window behind eren,  the tiles and panes. The form of the window i mean. I'm french so sorry if you don't understand what i mean. In chapter 122 it's the same window like in chapter 6 when they visit this memorie. That's grisha memories. But now comes the twist, when mikasa has this headaches, and she's remember this moment, chapter 109, look at the window behind eren.. it's not the same anymore. And look at chapter 112, again another window behind eren, not the same like in 6, 122 or 109.  Maybe it's an draw error, but maybe it was on purpose? 3 different versions of eren who is saving mikasa, and an ova (lost girl) where he don't save her. I think this is not a coincidence"
emmyeggo,Alfred_Lee,"Wow, a slight disappointment but a happy ending. Well, either Eren suddenly stops killing everyone, forgive and live peacefully (which is impossible at this stage) or the world united and see Eren as the devil (Eren dies), Paradis as saviour and live happily after.

emmyeggo,Dizzy-Application629,"If that's the case, Eren will forgot his wrong doings he caused in aot world if he is going to be transported to the au but according to the AnR mv the man was clearly mourning and being eaten by guilt until he gets old even he is in a supposed au."
Dizzy-Application629,emmyeggo,That‚Äôs a good point! It could very well be the case that Eren remembers this time. Or perhaps Mikasa remembers once again and tells him (?).
emmyeggo,rxzvlia,Wow that's... tough.. i would never come up with this
emmyeggo,OmgItzAman,"Despite Isayama's need to subvert expectations, one thing I don't think he can subvert is the pure fact that the Attack On Titan story is depressing and has consequences. If this theory turns out to be true...it kind of betrays all that, no? I don't think the main theme of a story should be forsaked for this grandeur alternate universe theme."
OmgItzAman,emmyeggo,"That‚Äôs a fair point. 

I do personally believe (if this theory is true) that there could be consequences to Eren‚Äôs actions. This is a crackpot theory, which is why I didn‚Äôt include it in the main post, but I have a feeling Armin may be 
‚Äòleft behind‚Äô to sacrifice himself in some way. This is because he is foreshowed as not only the ‚Äòsaviour of humanity‚Äô, but there is also imagery of him in the S3 ending where he is covered in blood, and it pans to Mikasa and Eren and he says ‚ÄòI won‚Äôt let your deaths be in vein, even if I‚Äôm the last one standing,‚Äô and then all the candles blow out except for one - which I believe to be representative of Armin. Perhaps Mikasa and Eren ‚Äòdie,‚Äô according to Armin, but they have really woken up again in the alternate universe; just the same as Chapter 1. We know that in Muv Luv, characters lose their memories when ‚Äòtravelling‚Äô between universes (which again, is why Eren in Chapter 1 said he woke up from a ‚Äòreally long dream‚Äô but ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt remember anything‚Äô)- but this wouldn‚Äôt be the case if Armin was left behind in the AOT universe. This is why he is the narrator; he will be the sole main character left to tell the story. 

And even if this doesn‚Äôt turn out being the case, I still haven‚Äôt seen anyone else offer an explanation for the Goth Mikasa and Nerd Armin memory shard, the Ymir Fritz memory shard (when she and Eren hadn‚Äôt met yet), all the school imagery in the S4 opening lyrics, all the comments made by Mikasa about seeing Eren die ‚Äòagain and again,‚Äô and the fact that Mikasa‚Äôs OVA, the AOT Junior High anime and the School Castes are all about alternate universes, just as the game Isayama based AOT on is as well. I personally believe that to end this series in the current universe, without explaining these things, would actually leave more plot holes than the theory I presented. And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm wanting this theory to be correct - but it‚Äôs the only explanation I‚Äôve been able to come up with so far that could possibly tie up every loose end given we only have 2 chapters left."
emmyeggo,OmgItzAman,"That's fair, I'm glad and thankful you're so detailed and expressive about these things. I'd imagine a lesser detailed explanation would piss more people off. If anything, and if this comes true, it'll be really interesting to see it play out. I like the theory that Armin is the only one to stay behind and deal with the consequences. If anything, I'm hoping there's some real, real consequences and aftermath because of the Rumbling. if the theory isn't true, then I'm even more intrigued in how Isayama explains everything. 
One thing: couldn't the memory shard of Ymir Fritz be a future memory? And couldn't Erens dream in the first episode/chapter be his entire future memory?"
emmyeggo,BeavMcloud,"Armin also says ""Goodbye"" instead of ""See you later."" I don't think I read the official translation, but if it's accurate then he could be saying bye forever like you mentioned in the post!"
emmyeggo,queencassiopeia27,"This would only make sense to manga readers who are aware of that school caste universe. For anime watchers, this comes out of nowhere and will be just another WTF moment."
queencassiopeia27,Joet2386,"Good point , although the first time that universe is shown was in Volume 22. But  the Anime is currently at the events of Volume 26. And the only direct hint we have of a universe like that in the anime is that shot of the Tybur children in school uniforms."
Joet2386,emmyeggo,"True! But there's only 10 School Caste previews, so they wouldn't start animating it until the last 10 episodes, so probably in Season 4, Part 2. And we know that every AOT anime ending always includes extra details, I imagine they could include the School Castes as part of the ending credits (and it also acts as foreshadowing)."
emmyeggo,migatte_yosha,what are the sources about Isayama's inspiration for Muv Luv ?

emmyeggo,LosMichalos,Why was Falco in his memories then ? His POV ? Does it fit your theory or ?
emmyeggo,BrklynDragon,Eren saw ymir when he kissed historias hand because he saw *grishas* memory of Erin seeing Ymir.
BrklynDragon,emmyeggo,"That would make it a future memory, not a past one"
emmyeggo,BrklynDragon,"Yes, the attack Titan can see the future memory of its future inheritors, and coming in contact with historia showed him *grishas* recollection of eren meeting Ymir in the future, since grisha can see that due to eren being a future inheritor."
emmyeggo,jsb217118,The problem is the high school AU was not included in the anime.
jsb217118,emmyeggo,"There are only 10 School Castes, so even if they were, I imagine it won‚Äôt be until Season 4, Part 2. 

Plus, if Isayama included the High School AU overtly in the anime/main story, people will catch onto the plot twist too quickly."
emmyeggo,Saikenmx,"RemindMe! 1 Month

While I disliked this theory I am now angry this doesn't became true, much btter than the garbage we got."
emmyeggo,ayosten,"probably asked before but what about ""this world"" translation in the original manga ?"
emmyeggo,UzumeofGamindustri,"Honestly one think I think Isayama could pull to not just make it a ""it was just a dream"" ending be to have everyone who died in the ""dream"" stay dead, but only Mikasa (not even Eren), knows the reason behind it. Alternatively, it could be like they never existed in the first place.

Or Isayama could also have Eren know about the deaths he had caused, and that would open up a whole new can of worms."
emmyeggo,Azerate2016,"I have a major issue with all the language-based arguments you raise here. First of all, have you checked how these language cues actually sound in the original Japanese version? Have you consulted with anyone who can read Japanese. Chances are that all those cases of ""this world"" and it differing from ""the world"" are only something present in the English version, and this kind of dichotomy doesn't even exist in Japanese. Even if it does though, I'm sorry to break it to you but it's perfectly normal for people to say ""this world"" instead of the world"". This refers not only to all the ""this world"" examples you listed, but other language based arguments as well."
Azerate2016,emmyeggo,"Yes, I have checked. Another user who speaks Japanese also commented on this post to verify; you can scroll down to see for yourself. 

And perhaps. However, I‚Äôm a pretty big movie buff and the only time I‚Äôve heard someone say ‚Äòthis world‚Äô was in Interstellar; and in this movie, there were quite literally multiple worlds. On the contrary, you never hear Superman say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm here to save this day!‚Äô Or, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm here to save this world!‚Äô It‚Äôs really just the basic rules of grammar."
emmyeggo,Azerate2016,"Fair enough for doing research then.

Of course we don't say ""save this day"", but I don't feel that referring to our world as ""this world"" is as rare, or weird sounding as you are claiming it to be, nor that it has to imply there are other worlds. Though you could also argue that by other worlds we could understand all the planets in the universe and thus our world is only just one of them in that sense.

I did a quick search on [https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/) for ""this world"" and got thousands of hits. While its true that many of them are in religious texts, and they juxtapose ""this world"" with heaven / afterlife, many of the hits are actually coming from very basic journalist / lifestyle blogs as well. People just say that sometimes, without it having any deeper meaning and reference to other worlds."

I imagine the next season or movie will start with 123 and 131 combined."
bladeshard12,Qpczyk,"Thats my thought too. Main theme of Part 2 is Rumbling and maybe Paths. What is the point of building that up, talking how cruel it is , naming OP The Rumbling and in the end basically do not even show it in full effect. It's mostly about murdering inocent families and thousands of titans crushing just Marley army is not it.

If there will be less rushed Part 3 I would somehow understand it because when the time comes it all will be part of one finished show. Tv show and movie are like two different things to me."

Seriously, after paths and the rumbling starting, it's nothing but filler and 'alliance building ' episodes until they actually show the events of the rumbling....which apparently won't be for quite some time if we have to wait for a movie or another part."
BossAtlas,DarkFace3482,"Personally i would have been done after seeing the rumblingt, freedom panel and Eren and Ramzi moment. I guess they try to keep the manga readers watching."
DarkFace3482,BossAtlas,"> I guess they try to keep the manga readers watching

Yeah but like...I really don't feel excited to go into a movie scenario knowing what's coming unless they really hint at AOE beforehand."
BossAtlas,The_Crimson_Fukr,"If it's a ""live action"" movie then not fucking thanks.. 

anime movies are dead on arrival"
waruice,frossvael,"I may be coping, but I hope they do something like what Monogatari did for its final season. Release the final episodes as a 45-minute event each.  


I don't want to wait for another year and then go and spend money on the cinema just to witness janky CGI animation and questionable writing for the ending."
waruice,IcyBally,Season 3 was split to 2 parts as well. Remember?
Mike20we,proccoliwastaken,I feel like it would be better to just drop the ‚Äúthe battle of‚Äù and leave it as Attack on Titan: Heaven and Earth. It‚Äôs sounds more like a movie title that way and less of a chapter title slapped onto the name of the series.
Mike20we,SuperLuminalBoi,i‚Äôm on board with this
Williace,VEXEnzo,"And so 131 will not be adapted...

Well if we get a movie only the first 10 mins will be worth. If we get a season 3 part 2 part 2 only the first episode will be worth."
VEXEnzo,PartyEscortBotBeans,hear me out: AOE kino üòã
PartyEscortBotBeans,VEXEnzo,Not gonna happen. Give up your dreams and die soldier
PartyEscortBotBeans,cashcapone96,It will happen when they change 123 trust
Williace,Matt_37,Hey everyone. If it does get adapted into a movie I'll be editing it into a standalone episode for everyone to watch.
Matt_37,WailingSiren69,King
Williace,realrimurutempest,Anime only folks getting stuck with a cliff hanger.
realrimurutempest,vshark29,"I can already imagine anime people invested like hell into the story, getting to the cliffhanger, not willing to wait a couple of years for the movie/part 3, and then go read the manga. Poor things"
vshark29,ScanLot,"Nah, i have an couple anime only friends who just hate the story at this point and already dropped it."
vshark29,maxmrca1103,lol I read that last line in Zeke‚Äôs voice
Williace,KynoSSJR,I want to die. I kept telling my anime only friends that the final episode will be the greatest all of time too
Williace,IAmSona,"My copium tanks are empty fellas, we are not getting freedom. But thank god we are getting the Ratio Titan."
Williace,hesipullupjimbo22,That‚Äôs dumb. 131 is the perfect ending before the movie. It leaves us with a brand new Eren. And I thought them combining it with 123 would be lowkey genius but never mind I guess
Williace,Mohwi,"I was hoping 131 would be adapted on episode 12 so I can be done with aot, but oh well

Another year or so with you beautiful specimen"
Mohwi,WailingSiren69,We will never be free
Williace,BucketHerro,"MAPPA trying to squeeze as much Eren on the part 3/movie lmfaoo. 

They know the series needs more Eren on the final act."
Williace,ZegetaX1,What‚Äôs 130 about again been a while since manga
ZegetaX1,Williace,Its chapter where rumbling hit the world and Eren founder titan face is revealed.
Williace,ZegetaX1,That can still make good episode at least
Williace,GameboyAlternate28,"So what? 131 is gonna be in the movie? It's gonna be jarring as hell seeing the writing in like the first 20 minutes compared to the rest of the movie. And like, 132 is a better start to the movie. I just really disagree with how this is handled. Unless they put 130 and 131 in the same episode. Mappa does end episodes but not completing the chapter before the next episode. So perhaps we'll see a bit of 130 in episode 11 and the rest in 12 and then move on to 131 and finish the anime. Yes I'm having a copium overdose. Take me to the ER"
Williace,Ringo-Sheena_Simp,"Okay did Mappa officially stated that they're going to make a movie?

I have yet to seen an official source from this"
Ringo-Sheena_Simp,DumbfuckjuiceDrinker,"Yeah, I've been looking for an official source, but I haven't found anything either. I hope the whole story does get fully adapted in this season. I don't get why Season 4 Part 2 wouldn't adapt the remaining story beyond 12 episodes, when Part 1 had 16."
Ringo-Sheena_Simp,DarkJayBR,It's the logical conclusion. They have too little material left to do a entire season. After 131 the rest of the chapters are basically 100% battles.
Williace,JobTrunicht,"Chapter 131 is the only episode I wanted to see, guess I‚Äôll never watch the SNK anime past the start of the rumbling"
Williace,SternritterVGT,How are they gonna fit 9 chapters into 2 hours. Wtf.
SternritterVGT,DarkJayBR,"60% of these chapters are fights, just shorten some of the fights and you are good to go."
Williace,Seppel420,Jeez i go to the cinema and leave after the freedom panel
Williace,Iced-TeaManiac,What other reason would I have to watch the movie if 131 wasn't in it? MAPPA...What a businessman you are...
Williace,desperatley-valiant,longest final season I've seen in ages
Williace,Raknel,"Just because it has chapter 130's title doesn't mean it can't adapt 131 too, right?"
Raknel,Matt_37,It's adapting 123+130
Matt_37,GWENDOLYN_TIME,How do we know that exactly?
Williace,bayek46,Maybe just maybe (*inhales)1 more year is what we need for an aoe
Williace,Accelerator-Deflect,Sometimes I truly regret getting into this series.
Williace,GilgameshTheKnight,"Damn, chapter 131 will be lumped in with those remaining dogshit garbage chapters in a movie."
Williace,ParchedTatertot,aoe is coming
Williace,samgo88,does that mean new Opening song?
samgo88,LyannaEugen,Does a movie have an opening?
Williace,roki,"Ugh, the only thing that could have saved the anime..."
roki,LanceEndan,130 will save it
Williace,Wicioslaw123,"So, how is it confirmation to end of season?"
Williace,UpperRank1,Is this legitimately true or fake news?
UpperRank1,Forsaken_Raspberry11,The leaker is trustable
Williace,GuardOfTheDawn,We lost...
Williace,Bayro1997,"This was my prediction for the next four episodes so far:

**Episode 4x25:** Chapter 127, the first 50% of Chapter 128

**Episode 4x26:** the missing 50% of Chapter 128, Chapter 129

**Episode 4x27:** the missing 70% of Chapter 123, Chapter 130

**Episode 4x28:** Chapter 131

Now I'm just sad.... The only possibility I can see would be if Mappa saves Chapter 123 for the beginning of Part 3 and tells Chapter 130 and Chapter 131 in Episode 12. But this would take all the tension and build up out of Chapter 123."
Williace,mcaillister,"At this point I'm just tired and the only thing I want is to see 130 and 131. It's a disgrace to 131 for it to appear together with the shit that take place in the ending. Just how would eren's character get from ""freedom"" to that? And you think including 131 in the movie will make me go and watch it? Joke on you."
Williace,Gulpped,I just want to see Levi kill zeke
Williace,jwaters0122,Perfect timing. Just before it all goes to shit
jwaters0122,WailingSiren69,They're missing chapter 131
Williace,Razerx7,[So no 131‚Ä¶?](https://makeagif.com/i/k4JScf)
Williace,Dense_Parsley2925,"while 130 is my favorite chapter, even surpassing 131, im not sure that its the greatest choice for the ending. we already have mappa shoving 123 in with it because they decide not to animate it properly for whatever reason."
Williace,mightyrfc,Is there any chance of having longer episodes or basically the movie is already confirmed?
Williace,ihei47,"Bruh, part 1 didn't give us 122, now part 2 won't give us 131"
Williace,wilzix12,"Who cares aot ends at 130-131 and they are not going to do a movie, another year to wait for shit plot, just go watch avengers/marvel movies"
Williace,BOSHunterCO,Gonna be quite the rollercoaster of emotions
Williace,Bayro1997,Hopium: Episode 12 will be overlong and will end with Armin and Eren in the paths as a cliffhanger (after the Freedom Panel).
Williace,TrailOfEnvy,Pain üíÄ
Williace,BobTrain666,Mappa is a bunch of master baiters‚Ä¶
Williace,Accelerator-Deflect,That's severely disappointing there goes my hopes of seeing 131 animated.
Williace,fedfan4life,That means this season will have adapted 14 chapters in 12 episodes. Slow ass pacing.
fedfan4life,Williace,Its better then 26 chapter in 16 ep.
Williace,Typical_Rip_2123,wait WHAT
Williace,emmennuel,Mmgh
Williace,Mx-Rylie,Guys wait this totally means the movie will be two movies. AoT Unlimited and AoT Alternative /s
Williace,ddb996,This truly is the darkest timeline.
Williace,ComicNerd7794,I don‚Äôt care what anyone says despite how good it was at start every medium of attack on Titan has screwed the fans over
Williace,Valerynotfound,"I mean, the only thing I ( unironically ) looked forward to was the freedom panel... Guess I'll have to wait."
Williace,Emperor_Krimson,REWRITE ENDING
Williace,ReaperOfLuigi,Is this tweet 100% confirmed cause people acting like it is
Williace,16dsmyth,I would much rather if the anime ended at 131
Williace,Noobface_,It‚Äôs because they are getting rid of chapter 131 and ending it early without a shit ending
Williace,pootis64,Despair
Williace,tofu-dreg,So have to wait for movie to see 131... What a disappointment.
Williace,GintamaTheHero,Bruh
Williace,Meme_Theocracy,Jesus fuck I just want to see some kids get crushed to death now we have to weight because mappa wants to torture everyone.
EMJG30,Arshnoor-Sran,"Another great plot-twist will be when Jean, Connie, Gabi, and the rest of the Eldians turn into Titans. But then the next week it would mean nothing."
Arshnoor-Sran,CoolBlastin,I actually almost cried when that happened fuck isayama
CoolBlastin,JanreiAfrica,I teared up at that scene. It was honestly a fine send-off. And then 139 happened.
Arshnoor-Sran,Dat_life_on_Mars,Next week? I think it will be in the same episode unless they decide to expand on 139 or Mappa directors make a creative choice
Arshnoor-Sran,LankySeat,Would've been better off just not turning them into titans at all IMO.
Arshnoor-Sran,NirvanaFrk97,"I saw it as the cheap twist that it was. I didn't believe it because it happened before the last chapter.

I knew they were coming back."
NirvanaFrk97,Arshnoor-Sran,"It was actually the exact opposite for me. It happened in the second to last chapter, so I thought for sure Eren had won. It didn‚Äôt make sense for them to turn into Titans and then back in just 2 chapters. But then we all know what happened."
Arshnoor-Sran,UnknownAcc_,it‚Äôll be on the same episode.
Arshnoor-Sran,Punished_Venom_Nemo,How is a worm farting on people 'a great plot-twist'?
Punished_Venom_Nemo,Clonecommder,Because it finally shit on the plot armor from the final fight.
EMJG30,Fraudulent_Baker,"Unbelievable twist and one of the best moments in any manga I‚Äôve read, but ultimately I think it harmed the story. The earlier hints that paths transcends time were neat, but introducing actual time travel and foresight opens a whole other can of worms."
Fraudulent_Baker,Balor_Lynx,Literally opened a can of a worm to be precise
Balor_Lynx,Fraudulent_Baker,"Wait, Worm-kun was just a meta joke by Isayama?!"
EMJG30,shaheerajmal,I know what's gonna happen but even I'll flip out in the anime
EMJG30,Wiimmoz,I feel like something is really fucking off about the last chapter. It's like Isayama just forget every plot that he had planned.
Wiimmoz,StNerevar76,"The last 3, maybe 4.

What you feel is that everything is looking 180¬∞ from where it should. You were basically led by the nose to a cliff and thrown off it, and you are wondering WTF is going on as you fall.

Check ch 63 side by side with this one. This was Isayama's plan for years... because this was never about Eren going nihilistic on the world. That was the trap, and 121-3 were the bait. 139 is the ""ending"" to something that wasn't even going on, that never held together, but most dismissed the increasing number of flaws because it was appealing. Now it isn't, but no longer can dismiss it as the false bs it is.

If you ever wondered how Gabi could fight reality so long to keep believing the marleyan propaganda... now you know."
StNerevar76,Fraudulent_Baker,"Are you planning on making a comprehensive post outlining this meta theory? I‚Äôve been seeing your comments a lot and you bring up some interesting points about propaganda, lies, etc., but it would be much nicer to read as one long write-up if possible."
StNerevar76,palindrome777,"There really isn't a plot hole between 63 and 121,

Freida looking more determined and angry there is a continuation of her looking scared in 121, she gains the determination to fight for her family, as we see in 121, and quickly bites her hand to kill Grisha, where, exactly, is the plot hole ?"
Wiimmoz,CentJr,"Well there's something off about this chapter too.


Frieda talked about the destruction of Paradis and the need to accept it because of their sins as Eldians.


Yet the Reiss family (who were behind her)' never heard Frieda's ramblings. They even asked her to kill Grisha to save their Paradise (despite what Frieda just talked about)"
CentJr,Mukigachar,"Plus Grisha asking Zeke to stop Eren, then immediately giving Eren the Attack Titan because ???"
EMJG30,Potential-Twist-6106,I believe mikasa killing eren was planned from the beginning but was it the same for the ymir arc? I believe yams just added it to justify aot end
Potential-Twist-6106,proteanthony,"‚ÄúLove someone inside the Walls. If you can‚Äôt, this history is doomed to repeat. The same mistakes, over and over.‚Äù

Feel like that might be relevant foreshadowing in some way idk"
Potential-Twist-6106,Iamcarval,"But why? Seriously, there is no indication or hints about her killing Eren. On the other hand, there were a lot of hint for her possible death because of Eren."
Iamcarval,Mukigachar,"""See you later, Eren"" makes no possible sense in a timeline where Eren kills her"
EMJG30,Disastrous-Bike2526,From diamond to wood lol
EMJG30,Aksula-1,This is the peak of SnK right here. Aside from this AnR is my official canon. With that passion project AoT is a masterpiece
EMJG30,Vis-hoka,"And Eren uses this amazing ability to just do whatever Ymir wants anyway, without understanding why. And then cry about a girl. 10/10

Isayama had a complete mental breakdown to write this."
EMJG30,sobangcha,"I didn't like this. I think it was better that Grisha killed the Reiss family on his own free will, forced into a corner and setting aside his own morals for the sake of his people. Having Eren be the reason he ends up killing them took away from Grisha's characterization imo."
EMJG30,JNuts67,"My favourite plot twist ever. Not normally a fan of this kind of time paradox style thing, didn't like it in Harry Potter, but this just worked for me, helps that Paths being a somewhat expected time/space fuckery made it more palatable. This working had a lot to do with how this scene played out for the readers previously, it really stuck with me as making me dislike Grisha and sympathise with Eren and Historia, only to have that completely turned on its head. And in a way that made so much sense, with Eren being revealed to have truly and inherently been this way since birth, and even tied back in with Kruger using the same words to manipulate Grisha to proceed to Paradis in the first place. Such a sick moment, really sad to have to look back at it with the tainted lens of the ending."
EMJG30,Tarzan_JNG,"When I've read *that* page i finally understood what having a bone-chilling experience feels like, it literally shook me. Amazing, amazing chapter."
EMJG30,MilesYoungblood,Honestly I don‚Äôt vibe with Eren manipulating Grisha. It‚Äôs like writing your own origin story. Imagine if Sasuke went back in time and made Itachi kill his clan. Or if Naruto caused Nine-Tails attack. Same energy. You don‚Äôt cause your own origin story. That‚Äôs supposed to be out of the character‚Äôs control.
MilesYoungblood,unofficialbds,this was like my favorite chapter lmao
MilesYoungblood,kremasag,"Black Zetsu essentially wrote every major characters origin story, manipulating almost every villain for his grand scheme"
kremasag,MilesYoungblood,Stupid af. Madara should‚Äôve been the real big bad manipulator
kremasag,TryZealousideal5192,"Black Zetsu is actually just fine. I'd take that over the clusterfuck we got here.

The thing with Black Zetsu was that Kishimoto wanted to milk the series with Boruto."
MilesYoungblood,NirvanaFrk97,"He didn't write his own origin story. At this point, Eren only pushed Grisha to keep moving and take the Founding Titan. 139 had the stupid reveal with Eren killing Carla.

It should have remained with the Attack Titan solely having that ability, and Eren only directly motivating Grisha."
NirvanaFrk97,MilesYoungblood,Eren literally forced Grisha to get the founding Titan. It‚Äôd be like if Naruto made his mother become a jinch≈´riki then have her die so he can become the nine tails jinch≈´riki
NirvanaFrk97,Alive-Money8198,"For me, so there are 2 eren in different timeline, 1st is eren future, 2nd is eren present that we know, for me, eren from the future the one who inciting grisha to kill reis family and kill eren mother present on 2nd timeline, so present eren is just a victim of eren future, just like eldian (victim) in marley, doctrin by marley gov, thay no other choice just to follow marley gov. Same like eren then, no other choice folloe what eren from the future."
MilesYoungblood,sobangcha,"I agree with you! 

When done well this type of paradox can be really interesting in fiction, **however** this is not needed in the story of AoT. The conditions for making these characters great is already there and this self-perpetuating character motivation takes away from Eren's and Grisha's characterizations. 

We already know Grisha is a dedicated and loyal restorationist, and we even see him postpone his attack on the Reiss family to go and be a better person with a family this time around so as to not repeat the mistakes he did in Marley. Grisha taking the Founding Titan was because his hand was forced by Marley's attack on the walls and he has to set aside his morals for the sake of his mission. Although he tries to plea with the Reiss family for their help, he cannot get the answer he wants and is thus forced to kill them because he has run out of time.

Eren's motivation for fighting is already clear and is established from chapter 1 and is readjusted when they get to the ocean and he realises he must fight humans and not titans. We don't need him to force motivations upon his father or himself because the world has already done that for them."
sobangcha,MilesYoungblood,"Exactly. I couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself. Eren forcing Grisha to take the founder takes away from Grisha‚Äôs characterization and agency, and it just feels wrong. The scene could‚Äôve never existed and it still would‚Äôve been fine. But nope, gotta have that shock value."
MilesYoungblood,Dry_Wall_7914,"I always thought it was unnecessary, Grisha could've done that on his own (and we thought he did until this chapter) and the story would've been exactly the same. It adds nothing for me, just cementing Eren as a villain, but that would've been clear in 123 anyway"
Dry_Wall_7914,MilesYoungblood,Exactly. Just empty shock value this is. Take it out and nothing‚Äôs changed.
MilesYoungblood,EMJG30,I didn‚Äôt mind because unlike Sasuke I thought Eren was trying to save all Paradisians at any cost.
EMJG30,MilesYoungblood,"Yes but I think time travel/ time intervention never belonged in this story. And besides, you don‚Äôt need it to convey the lengths Eren would go to save his people. Him even doing the full Rumbling is enough. It‚Äôs literally a worldwide massacre. I don‚Äôt know how much more resolved you need to be to pull that off."
MilesYoungblood,Bradythenarwhal,">You don‚Äôt cause your own origin story. That‚Äôs supposed to be out of their control.

Says who? I honestly think it‚Äôs cool Yams put a spin on it. It‚Äôs a story."
Bradythenarwhal,MilesYoungblood,"I personally don‚Äôt think a character should have any control over their life until the moment they emerge from their mother. But even then, they‚Äôd be a baby so they couldn‚Äôt do anything. So to estimate, they should start having control the moment they can really make decisions for themselves. Eren at the start of the show is a perfect example of what I mean."
EMJG30,hisushii,"hmmm the ""even if you die"" ""even after you die"" sounds very familiar....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

oh fuck no"
EMJG30,StNerevar76,"Indeed. 

I still can't believe nobody went and check ch 63. Myself included, and that always felt wrong to me.

Turns out it was because IT IS WRONG.

Frieda acts different in ch 63. Grisha shifts earlier and more sudden, because Frieda & family are all still where they are when Grisha appears. And in ch 121, the family did not hear the conversation between Frieda and Grisha, one of the siblings asks her to kill Grisha to save their paradise... which she just had left very clear she was going to let destroyed. Why Frieda acts different? Guess who she saw that wasn't around in ch 63.

Ch 121 is one of the greatest baits in the story of fiction. So good that people still refuse to reevaluate it even pointing the differences outright.

The ending we got is deliberate false bs. And this was where most people got caught. As if Isayama ever played fair."
StNerevar76,swidell99,"Sorry I didn't understand completely your comment, did you said that ch 121 came from a retcon?"
swidell99,StNerevar76,"It's not a retcon, unless you count it in universe. It's that Zeke and Eren, because Grisha and Frieda could feel them around, altered the original sequence of events, and that later sequence is what we've been reading. When Eren remembers in ch 63, Frieda is hostile to Grisha, and he shifts earlier. It's also the chapter we see his angry grief when telling Eren he'll avenge his mother. Whether through the AT, or the dream from ch 1, Eren remembers that. When we see the events through Shaddis' flashback, Grisha says that in a subdued tone. Later on, it doesn't fit. Just before titanizing him, he's sorry for his son, not angry about Carla.

Then in ch 90 Eren remembers something different. No wonder he looked ""wtf?"". That moment Frieda looks surprised as Grisha asks her to kill the mindless? In ch 121 we see when Grisha speaks, Eren and Zeke are behind him. She saw them, and she changed her attitude. Or maybe Karl's did. They weren't around in ch 63, so Frieda had to push Grisha herself. More on that below. There are subtle differences between those panels between ch 90 and 121, too. It's odd because they could be copy pasted otherwise. 

So, ch 121. The family didn't hear the conversation. There's also Rod during uprising: yes, he was a jerk, but when Historia finished him, she saw how frustrated he was about Karl's will taking over his father, brother, and daughter, and that it wouldn't allow them to do anything about the titans. He still wanted Historia to take it, but I find it hard to believe he would have done so believing that will was letting Paradis get exterminated. And Grisha spoiled the AT memory trait, or at least what he believed it was. Yet nothing in Rod suggests he is aware Eren could be playing with loaded dice. It's not a stable loop, and things get even more complicated. Short version: he has memories of future(s) past, not the future to be. Easy to guess how they ended. Going by what he told Reiner, he's already rumbled the world before, and the world was also rumbled without his help. Given Eren's character, that's the only way he'd see it as predestined. The rumbling isn't about killing everybody, but he needs Ymir to believe so.

About Frieda: she mentored Historia in a way that's very fitting for her current position (the bird Eren in 139 must suffer indigestion from all the turning Frieda has to be doing at seeing how Historia wasted her time), and shills Ymir a lot to her. It's also very interesting that Ymir is a good girl to look up to, yet the titan power comes from the devil. Frieda wanted Historia to like Ymir, yet reject the power. Her reaction at Historia saying it was her she looked up to was also something, although she covered it quick. In 90, Historia gets a reaction shot too, and memory unlocks are not just about contact, but set to a moment. And we barely see her since then. I can't believe people bought the conversation in ch 130 would convince her to support a full world rumbling, or that the pregnancy suggestion flowed from their conversation. She also had a sense of dramatic timing for giving birth... don't think people have considered how dark the theory the baby is to reincarnate Ymir is. And that's why Frieda ""groomed"" her for it. 

The Vow prevented the Reiss from using the Founder full powerset, even for defense. That meant Karl's successors couldn't reclaim the Empire. Yet what Frieda says in 121 is that's more than useless in a Reiss in order to help eldians. And when Eren intervenes, she's indeed about to attack. It's coming the time to use the Founder's full power again, and for that reason, it can no longer be on a Reiss host. Tsaver didn't simply have the bypass loophole in the BT's database. She taunted Grisha into attacking in ch 63, don't know if things in 90 went down as in 121, or Eren only moved in the latter case. But it's basically reloading a save and try something else.

Ch 122 explains why Ymir obeyed. Why she resents the world for it. And why asking her to end the curse won't work. ""Only Ymir knows"" is a great joke, because if she knew, she'd nope out of it: she can't oppose Fritz's will, because that's the way the world works for her. Consider that DYING didn't let her be free, and that her path avatar is still that broken girl, it's easy to understand why she feels that way. Why, as Armin notes in the last chapter that actually made sense, she has to want the world gone too. Because it's a world where her only reason to exist is obeying the jerk who broke her life, and he wanted an eternal ruling titan bloodline. 

That's what the rumbling is about, giving her something compelling enough to break her chains. She freed those pigs, because she could see beauty in life, even with her lot. And now she believes Eren won't stop until the whole world excluding Paradis is dead. And no, Marley needing to be destroyed anyway, and having taken Eldia's place as oppressor in anybody younger than 105's memories aren't happy coincidences. Karl and Willy weren't too stupid to believe, we should not have believed they were so stupid."
EMJG30,EDNivek,And he clearly hadn't thought it out because Grisha from 121 his actions make little sense.
EMJG30,yusiur,Honestly I remember seeing this page and I was going fucking wild cause holy shit that really hit different
EMJG30,ibillu,"This chapter is part of why I really think some external factor caused Isayama to end it the way it did and it wasn‚Äôt what he actually wanted, I just can‚Äôt believe after all foreshadowing and careful story crafting he just threw all that away on his own volition"
ibillu,Iamcarval,"The attack titan power, the curse of Ymir, Marley, Historia-Ymir, Eren doing the rumbling. Years of hints and foreshadowing in those things that were amazing to look into retrospective and be like ‚Äúoh, it makes sense now‚Äù.

And then he decided to make Mikasa the central point of the story out of fucking nowhere in the last chapter... Something obviously happened, but maybe we will never know what."
EMJG30,Dry_Wall_7914,"Honestly it wasn't that good, I always thought it was unnecessary"
EMJG30,berial6,"Me at 121: Eren can see the future! This will sirely play w big role...
Me at 139: oooh yeah there was smth about future memories...."
EMJG30,AquaticDeskLamp,Joe mama had one of the greatest plot twists I‚Äôve ever seen in fiction
EMJG30,Skipskipu,I only hope Berserk don't get the same treatment from now on
EMJG30,TheEggStore,Eugh I don‚Äôt really share the same hype for 121
EMJG30,Nenanda,More like one of the dumbest thing I have ever seen in fiction. Seriously I am starting to think that even Endgame time travel bs plot made more sense than this. I persnoally was turn off by this plot point because since this moment I know this manga will end in complete disaster. It creates more questions than it answers and I think we should have never go this route.
Nenanda,Bypes,"The questions it raises didn't need to necessarily be answered as long as it keeps the direction and focus, which is ""here we show how far Eren is willing to go and how unstoppable he has become"", but then Yams did his best to somehow explain why with all his insane powers given between 119 and 136, none of it mattered and he lost anyway.

Just makes Eren a huge hypocrite to have him murder fucking billions of innocent strangers and yet be unable to sacrifice a few people he cares about. Contrast that with Kiritsugu who, with his simplified ideals, still had the same rationale as Spock and stayed true to them by sacrificing everything he loved for the greater good ^(the greater good)

In the end, Eren was just the ultimate selfish dude who didn't even know for sure if he got what he wanted/succeeded, sacrificing the happiness of the world for a mere possibility that his friends live long lives."
Bypes,Nenanda,I would not have as such problem with Eren's character as I have with the fact we never got answer why intervened presumably in fixed timeline here and what exactly prevented him to do anything elae. Wholw time travel thing needed exact limitations and explanation which would benefit even for youe point if we knew Eren's weaknesses perhaps his defeat would not be total bs
EMJG30,Projectonyx,I loved this scene so much. It was like we were finally getting to see Eren's determination(true colors) but then he started whining about Mikasa not being his simp
Projectonyx,Bypes,"I wish Yams wrote that Eren actually only had to lose in 138 instead of dying so that all his comrades would run the fuck away from him like Skylar ran from Walter White after all the shit he caused. But no, Yams' concept of love is so disgusting that Mikasa worships his fucking grave like Eva Braun's ghost haunting Adolf's unmarked grave because uhh love transcends all."
EMJG30,Norim01,"Chapter 121 didn‚Äôt do it for me tbh.

I honestly think it was meant to be a red herring in the original ending; Eren made Zeke believe that he manipulated Grisha into killing the Reiss family, tricking Zeke (and Ymir Fritz) to think that everything was predestined. ''Eren set the story in motion'' isn‚Äôt such a good plot-twist anyway; It‚Äôs incredibly appealing, but a predetermined, causal time-loop (''You cannot change fate'') doesn‚Äôt make sense in regards to the story‚Äôs anti-nihilistic thematic backdrop.

If you compare the Cavern scene as it was depicted in 63 (https://imgur.com/a/0yKV2L1) with the one from 121 (https://imgur.com/a/DxM6maE), they‚Äôre different from one another in terms of Frieda‚Äôs behaviour as well as Grisha‚Äôs as well as the Reiss family‚Äôs. Also, Frieda notices Eren‚Äôs presence in Chapter 121: https://i.imgur.com/nnTMWBa.jpg

Furthermore, the scene from Chapter 1 is different from how it was depicted in Chapter 121, Grisha‚Äôs facial expressions went from neutral (https://i.imgur.com/C0IFixj.jpg ) to frightened (https://i.imgur.com/0GiWohq.jpg) and that shouldn‚Äôt happen if the story is predestined.

We‚Äôre talking different iterations of the same timeline here. Chapter 121 was a lie/setup. Chapters 137-139 were arguably a punishment for not questioning Eren Yaeger‚Äôs lies."
Norim01,tommyfrank713,"It was the other way around tho, Eren tricked Zeke to think that he was manipulated by Grisha"
Norim01,TryZealousideal5192,"Nah, the problem here was that Eren tricked Zeke. Grisha most likely gave the titans to Eren after seeing everything.

A bit incompetent in thinking aren't you? You are implying that Eren showed the viewer a lie. It was far from that, Eren was the type of person that would fight for the freedom of his people, as well as himself. He voices this in the manga that he is doing it for his friends as well.

At the time, Isayama didn't want to show everything, so your point is practically irrelevant. 121 was the best and practically set a standard for great story telling, sadly everything after was just a degradation of character development.

Eren went from someone that hated the idea of bringing everyone against you. He became a Simp."

TryZealousideal5192,Bypes,">A bit incompetent in thinking aren't you?

Almost as edgy as Eren in that table scene bro. As much as I liked the concept of the table scene, Eren resorting to a ""I hate you"" line reminded me of RotS Anakin way too much."
EMJG30,saverma192013,Definitely

I wish there was a way to regain what it meant to me then"
emmyeggo,bigmemes4,r/titanfolk is back
bigmemes4,TeamBulletTrain,"My favorite thing about AoT was the Norse references. The rumbling being Ragnarok and Eren being like Baldr is kinda bad ass.

EDIT: now that I‚Äôm thinking about it, wouldn‚Äôt Eren be more like Loki? Loki is the one who starts Ragnarok with an army of giants, he does become a bird multiple times. I could be talking out of my ass but I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts. 

I can also see multiple references to Odin from Eren. Ymir was Odins father just like our Ymir is The Founder. There‚Äôs a lot of references to spears , Eren loses his eye briefly and gains ultimate knowledge. Plus the big ass tree. Odin sacrifices himself to himself at the world tree, so maybe Eren reborn is waiting in the tree.

emmyeggo,OneMintyMoose,"I feel like the strongest evidence is the first scene in the anime being so different from the manga.  Especially because the manga ending (of 138) is so closely tied to the first scene with mikasa and eren and their dialogue.   The anime opening scene is so different it actually gives me hoping that the multiverse theory is real.  Also some good evidence imo is the birds flying different directions/being different colors, as well as Eren's berserk mode in s2 where he declares his freedom which is absent in manga, could be influenced by him being shown something different by s4 anime Eren.

I think the strongest evidence against it is that we are only seeing this in retrospect of the manga ending.  Most of us here thought that the manga ending would basically be AnR or something similar, even with knowledge of the first few panels.

Also, the first scene in the anime obviously was made before Isayama changed his ending around 2017(IIRC), so he could have changed his mind and the anime and manga endings will be the same."

emmyeggo,Mrtheliger,"Man, if only. I'm totally soured on Isayama's ability to write an ending without feeling the pressure of expectations and whatnot, and this theory also continues to completely ignore Historia as she has no relevancy in most anything you mention, but I'd be somewhat accepting of this.

That said, you reference The Eternal Champion here, but the parallels between SnK and that series mostly centered around one Champion, Erek√∂se. With the 139 ending, Erek√∂se and Eren are no longer really similar, but before that there were many similarities between the two characters and their actions, specifically how they each chose to carry out omnicide in order to save a minority people using secret weapons the opponents had no hope of countering(in Erek√∂se's case his final decision was based on selfish love, for Eren if you didn't believe in EreHisu it was simply for his people. I *much* prefer the selfish decision of Erek√∂se and find it to make him one of the more compelling champions, even up there with Elric and Corum). The Eternal Champion series isn't so much about alternate realities so much as it is about reincarnation and the weight those past lives bring you."
Mrtheliger,emmyeggo,"I didn‚Äôt really have the room to discuss each character in depth, but I do agree - there is enough evidence to believe that Historia‚Äôs character could lead to something more; afterall, her name literally sounds identical to ‚Äòhistory erased.‚Äô 

And I agree w your Eternal Champions analysis, although it it a fact that alternate realities existed in this book (in whatever method), which was the point of the post :)"
emmyeggo,Mrtheliger,"I see I see. Honestly, I do genuinely think you could be onto something here, although maybe with a few tweaks(to me it seems any continuation would mostly be about Eren ""fixing"" his mistakes that led to the destruction of his people and Paradis). Stuff like AnR not having any sort of resolution even though Linked Horizon and the video maker clearly had knowledge of future manga events when making it, and all of the clear foreshadowing for a sequel definitely point to something along the lines of what you're theorizing with here."

emmyeggo,C-204,"I totally agree that the ending itself is a ""bad end"" of sorts, and that there's far too much left unanswered to be a proper conclusion. I don't totally agree with the term of ""multiverse"" since that concept tends to imply the trivialization of the conflict within a story (Which is why S;G for example does away with it), but it gets the point across. I prefer a ""mirrored world"".

Pertinent to that terminology I think that if there's any mechanism by which an alternate ending would be reached, it would be symbolically and to a degree literally associated with reflections, inversions, opposite dualities. (Mirrors, black and white birds, freedom and death, the world outside and inside the walls, EMA-RAB) There's tons of examples of things being ""mirrored"" in the show and the lost in a cruel world OVA really doubled down on that quite literally. The manga ending itself being mirrored through either a continuation, or what I find more likely the anime adaptation, would be a natural extension of that motif."

Further, one of the last things Isayama ever produced (so far) was an extra addition for the AOT final volume (June) which depicted a multiverse Eren in a modern day city (seperate to School Castes). 

I guess we won‚Äôt know until later, but until then, I‚Äôm staying open minded. :)"
emmyeggo,raceraot,">Those leaks I believe were lost in translation, unless you have a different source? 

Not just that. You can tell Isayama doesn't want to write anymore. 

He has told, multiple times, that he's not making another story beyond aot. 

His interview with demetrious Johnson, when the wrestler asked him about whether he would make anything after the ending, he said he'd rather make an onsen rather than a manga."

emmyeggo,wilserax,"Reminds me of the theories about bran stark back when got s8 has yet to be released, it will probably end up the same too"
emmyeggo,StNerevar76,"No, for a very simple reason.

You can have things ending badly and still making sense.

This ending doesn't, and is very deliberate in how it goes at it. Characters, themes, look 180¬∞ from where they should.

It's not things ended this bad, it's that there's no way they could have ended this way.

The timeline isn't fixed. Ch 63. Now about everybody that reads what I post is trying to headcanon it as art evolution, or Isayama not checking back when he drew ch 121. If I, or anybody, had realized it back then, we would have caught the trap the moment it was sprung on us, because Isayama had given us enough information to be able to do so.

But I don't think it's pararel universes, but kind of reloading an earlier save and trying something else with the accumulated knowledge of how things failed. Same plane of existance.

What I see in general is that despite realizing perfectly the ending is 100% wrong, hardly anybody can deny it, because it's the ending to the narrative since ch 121, and people got too captivated by Eren's, and the story's, nihilism. If they deny the ending, they deny the story.

Isayama is very much antinihilistic. That should have said it all.

If Gabi acknowledged Kaya's arguments against the marleyan propaganda at the barn, she denied the propaganda. 

Notice the similarity? This is a lesson, not a simple stunt.

Something that will subvert expectations but in a good way, AU Armin says, while his conversation with Mikasa points out how weak this ending is. My guess is that's for some time after the anime ends. No point changing anime, because if this targeted only manga readers, it'd wait too long for it. Vol 34 would have been a much better moment. The shitstorm will break again with the anime onlies reaction, P1 left clear they were taking the bait."
StNerevar76,emmyeggo,"I hear what you're saying, but you're forgetting one key thing - **Isayama, and the AOT editors have** ***already*** **hinted at a sequel/continuation of some description** (hence all the 'Beren' jokes). Thus, this theory wasn't created because I think it needs fixing, I am saying that if a sequel *is* going to happen, then this method makes more sense (rather than some random ass characters repeating the same mistakes). 

As you said, I also think the themes fit, but the fact of the matter is that **some things were left unexplained, and I am suggesting that maybe this** ***could*** **be purposeful** (after all, who would read/watch a sequel if everything was wrapped up in a perfect bow). 

Isayama is nihilistic, yes - which is almost why the ending doesn't make sense. As stated in the post, he is also said many times he wants to '**betray**' '**prank**' and '**deceive**' fans, so who's to say it's not possible? 

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, this is just a theory - but I think I have provided sufficient evidence for people to remain at least a *little* openminded. :)"
emmyeggo,StNerevar76,"I'm saying this isn't the real ending since the beginning, giving reasons for it, and getting mostly ""can't hear you"". Which is the same I got for more than a year when explaining why the rumbling was actually about getting Ymir to end the curse. 

The ending does not make sense because Ymir couldn't love, so no way she loved Fritz. Because Eren would not have rolled with his visions, and already had conflicting memories of Grisha with Frieda. Because there was no time, and no colossals, to rumble outside Marley, let alone 80% of the world. Because when they jumped off the plane, they don't want to kill him, but after stopping the colossals they go for the kill. Because Mikasa would have been killed within days of arriving at Paradis, let alone how she got there, let alone peacefully forming a family there. Because a peace embassy won't include traitors and mass murderers (Reiner and Annie),...

Does not make sense. But people believe it's real. Will defend it's real, while hating it. And that should give anybody pause. 

It's not a prank, but a lesson. 

About possible sequels...transmitting titanization means someone would have to become the origin of the paths. Trapped there again. And this ending goes for all clich√© moves and nihilistic hacks that writers with not enough talent use to ruin stories thinking they are elevating themselves. Isayama showed repeatedly that he's above them. As AU Armin says, it goes for the easy and obvious.

Remember the final panel Isayama leaked? The one in 139 is neither the panel, nor the baby, nor makes any sense Grisha would say that. He didn't change it, he showed it as a clue.

About other works in this world... I really would like the story about Karl Fritz. No way the set up in the present was a fluke, he was going for it. He wasn't too stupid to believe, we should not have believed he was so stupid. Same for Willy."

There is definitely a piece of the puzzle missing which connects Historia, Eren and the baby to the ending. The inclusion of the Love Doctor dialogue makes me wonder if the same missing piece doesn't explain ""See You Later, Eren"", as well."
YakiBacki,altfeb7,"I think it has something to do with Ymir. Zeke said that he doesn't understand Ymir, but Eren understands her. That's why she is helping Eren. Then Armin said Ymir wants something right? [Look at the preview for the last volume.](https://i.imgur.com/HhB0xHO.jpg) It says

>Â∞ëÂ•≥„ÅØÂ§¢„ÇíË¶ã„Çã (The girl has a dream)  
>  
>Âë™Á∏õ„ÇÑÈÅãÂëΩ„Åã„ÇâËß£„ÅçÊîæ„Åü„Çå„Åü‰∏ñÁïå„ÅÆ (of a world free from curse and fate)

That's what Ymir wants. She wants to be born in that world."
YakiBacki,friskyforker,"This is a very well-thought out post. There is something left Isayama can offer with EH(though right now I‚Äôm constantly injecting and inhaling all forms of copium). They ‚Äúshould‚Äù be the final twist I hope.

However with the way Isayama has portrayed the two, for me, I really hope there‚Äôs a really reasonable reason why Historia‚Äôs kid inherited the Beast Titan. If Eren and Historia were really planning for her or THEIR child to inherit a Titan power, they are no better than Rod, Karina, Mr. Leonhart. They would essentially be using her kid for a tool and one of the main things Isayama has been trying to drill into us is to not let children be used for any sort of plan. Eren and Historia would be by far the WORST characters to do that, Eren for all the times he‚Äôs protected Historia‚Äôs from becoming a Titan and his constant rejection of her using her own kid, Historia for obvious reasons. Isayama would butcher their characters more than he already has this final arc.

May Isayama make next chapter better than this oneüíÄ"
friskyforker,AvalancheZ250,"The worst parts about being a Shifter is the 13 year curse, and the fact that multiple people want to use/kill you for that power for the remainder of your life. That doesn't apply if the person is only a Shifter for like a day, especially if they will never remember that day (who remembers the first day they are born?).

Narratively, EH being good parents can still work if the baby is only a Shifter for a short while to complete the Rumbling. Then, Paths can be removed and the baby can live a normal life without being a tool."
AvalancheZ250,fraubiest,"Just for my understanding, the 13 year curse is also applied on born titanshifters? That's hard."
friskyforker,DelphiCapital,">Rod, Karina, Mr. Leonhart, Grisha and Dina Fritz"
friskyforker,Comfortable-Night117,"In my language that part of the explanation says ""If a shifter dies without having passed on their power, the power is inherited by an Eldian baby born *after* their death"", which would make this impossible. Was it different in English/Japanese?"
YakiBacki,Allegryan,"Not sure if it was also implied in your post, but when the conversation cuts back and Historia is on the side of Eren, she is also *literally* on Eren‚Äôs side. The two of them swapped positions with Eren now on the left and Historia now on the right (from the perspective of the inside of the fences)."
YakiBacki,danneyney,"When I read the chapter first I was confused. Then I was angry. I was really frustrated because I didn't get the answers I wanted and what I'm struggling the most is to find out what's the meaning of the whole story. What's the point of Attack on Titan. When watching/reading I always found myself to be connected to the characters, the world and the themes. Sometimes I was left in the dark but it was ok because I trusted Isayama. I always had faith that the conclusion paid of, because up until this point it always did. Now we're left with only 2 chapters to go and chapter 137 really made me lose faith. Attack on Titan has such a special place in my heart that i couldn't live with a bad ending. But you gave me hope. Hope that it's all part of Isayamas big plan, that we're left in the dark on purpose. That our confusion have the purpose to give the impact meaning. Because this is the way Isayama hurts people, and that's why Attack on Titan is such a good Manga in the first place. Thank you for making me realize that"
danneyney,YakiBacki,"I understood the frustration of people, hence, why I made this. 

I mean, the biggest issues repeated around are ""Where Historia?"" ""Where Eren"" ""Did Eren just allow that to happen"" and I sort of agree... If that's truly it...

The way I read the story though, there is definitely something hidden. How can Isayama forget two (fan) favorite characters like that? He's better than that... I hope"
danneyney,Mr_1ightning,"You see, Isayama (especially lately) writes chapters that will flow well till the end when the story is completed instead of relying on big hype moment per chapter. 

Start of Uprising arc is a great example of that. It pays off in the end but goddamn is it slow to get through, and it must've been pretty boring reading it on monthly release."
Mr_1ightning,MandelAomine,Some people don't understand that Mangakas writes their chapter for the volume release above all
YakiBacki,Possible_Mind3663,Honestly I think eren told her something that hasn't happened yet and that may have caused her to change her mind about the rumbling
YakiBacki,carm_ineREd,"All the hardcore doomposters in the leaks & reaction threads need to read this. Great post, as usual."
carm_ineREd,pluma91,They'll just say only 2 chapters left and there's no more time for development or something like that.
YakiBacki,bubuplush,"I'll never forget how Historia told Eren that she's humanity's enemy, but Erens ally. Yams please give me EreHisu drug"
YakiBacki,cbfw86,Has anyone tried to piece together their conversation from across the chapters?
YakiBacki,ErwinSmith_GOAT,"> Yelena, Historia, Floch, Zeke and none of them had an additional piece of conversation hidden between them (Or ended up being pregnant, much to Floch‚Äôs disappointment)

Poor Floch"
YakiBacki,Psychological_Pop_60,"I used to think that Historia and pregnancy were the answer to Eren's mind. And with the last chapter on reproduction, the line ""born into this world"" and information about Ymir, we are either seeing an incredible turnaround or ... I don't know. I gave up theorizing."
YakiBacki,pelucasdriux,"Amazing post, and I think its the only way it would make sense. Either Eren saw this coming and has a plan for it, or he deliberately lost to the alliance, which would make no fucking sense."
YakiBacki,monk_i,It's almost like Isayama is a good writer that knows how to keep a reader in the dark until the right moment.
YakiBacki,wecas,This post keep me moving forward
YakiBacki,JesusHipsterChrist,I'm just glad someone else is calling whats happening Chekov's baby.
YakiBacki,No_Statistician7527,If this theory is true then I will both love and hate Isayama. Love him for pulling everything back together. Hate him for doing a fakeout at the 3rd last chapter and leaving me a nervous wreck for the next month.
YakiBacki,KeikakuAccelerator,"Since the last Eren POV chapter with Historia, I had the same thoughts: Some crucial bits of info are being hidden. 
Same with Grisha POV, there was something hidden which led Grisha to ultimately give the titan to Eren. I believe that something is the same what Eren tells to Historia, which is cut, and is the very reason Historia agrees to help Eren.

But only Yams knows. And he keeps moving forward!"
YakiBacki,Helgazdar,"From the moment I read 130, I got the idea that eventually, Eren explained his plan to SC and then erased their memories. I didn't push the theory to include the baby, but I agree with the pattern of Isayama's writing style you describe, so this feels plausible."
Helgazdar,urkimchii,"Except Mikasa or Levi considering the ackermans are immune to founder ability, their memories can't be altered/erased?"
urkimchii,Helgazdar,"Damn you're right, I forgot this part. Well for them, he could just hit them on the head very hard, and hope it makes them forget the last 10 minutes."
Helgazdar,Psychological_Pop_60,He could not. But at this point I don't doubt anything lol the story is all crazy
Helgazdar,DelphiCapital,He doesn't have the founding ability until he touches Zeke in Paradis though.
DelphiCapital,Helgazdar,"My understanding is that controlling the titans requires that Eren touches another TITAN of royal blood (Dina, Zeke), where altering/access memories only requires a HUMAN of royal blood (when he kisses Historia's hand for example). Eren does NOT want Historia to turn into a titan, so I guess he would just need her as human to erase memories"
YakiBacki,Zatheus,I'll cope with anything I can find at this point. Count me in.
YakiBacki,AzariTheCompiler,"Good fuckin job man, excellent points, wonderfully articulated, and concrete panels to back up the theory. Can‚Äôt wait to see anything more from you on here if you find any other mysteries in the series"
YakiBacki,AssassinAragorn,"I agree completely, there's something more in that conversation. Like you said, it's heavily implied. It makes no sense for her to turn on a dime like that."
YakiBacki,thiscantbesohard,"It feels like next month's chapter will be the most important one in the whole story, ever since the rumbling started i said that we will get Eren's full POV once the fight is over. This time I'm really feeling the big reveals coming...March can't come soon enough!"
YakiBacki,crosszerias,"Awesome Post! Let's hope Eren's and Historia's POV will be addressed next chapter.  
Edit: I'm still unsure about the Chekhov‚Äôs Baby theory, mostly because it would go against Eren's goals."
YakiBacki,mayayuri,Very happy that you brought receipts cause my memory would have failed me
YakiBacki,Yeagerenist,Ngl Eren probably told Historia about Zeke's secret ass wiping technique.
YakiBacki,wanderingsecret,"I saw a theory just now that strongly reinforce this theory it's about the song by Linked Horizon ""[Tasogaro no Rakuen](https://youtu.be/7Yx6iqPb3ag?t=118)"" the lyrics are as follows.

**What did the Boy(Eren) know?What did the Girl(Historia) not know?What did the Boy desire?What did the girl give up on...**

**I saw it,in a world dyed in a deep red sunset I was gently wrapped and was all shiny.**

**Before the setting sun sank,something beautifull shone**

**Before my eyes,beautifull flowers bloomed at the end of that sadness**

song came out way before ch.130.

i guess i just wanna let everyone know that's all.

my guess is that the ""scenery"" that made historia convinced by eren is something beyond the ""rumbling"" that's why historia gave up on stopping eren."
YakiBacki,maiyamay,"No one knows the full convo between them yet, but if u ask me some of the reasons could be:

Historia repaying Eren for not sacrificing her by saving him (through a plan we didnt know yet). This has happened time and time again ever since Uprising arc. The baby could be the reason Eren wants to return alive (ik cheesy) OR ultimately used as a plan (this butchers both of the characters) OR its both (they use the baby but at the same time Ymir's curse will be lifted when she is reincarnated, she is free."
YakiBacki,b761962,Ymir has a role or reveal yet to play out here.
YakiBacki,jazzimus_prime,this is going in my based collection
YakiBacki,D3v4nsh,Thank you for hooking me up with some copium
YakiBacki,pootis64,Absolute Helos-tier post
YakiBacki,Pasway,I just love everything you wrote so much yaki god or whatever you believe in bless you my liege
YakiBacki,HalfLucan,"I had mixed feelings about this chapter, but this write up definitely puts some things into perspective.

My main issues are 

* I think Eren is right to do the rumbling
* For a guy who can seemingly know the future, it‚Äôs dumb how easily he got defeated

&nbsp;

I‚Äôll concede on the first point of it means the second isn‚Äôt what it seams."
HalfLucan,YakiBacki,"The thing about the second point is that exactly that could've happened.

Eren can see the future, but only partially. For example, he knew that he would defeat and eat the warhammer, but he did not know how he would eat it, hence the reason why he tried biting the crystal initially. If he had perfect foresight, he wouldn't have tried that in the first place, but instead immediately go for the jaw titan. He realises he needs to use the jaw only during the fight. 

Similar here, Eren could have seen that he gets defeated, but not how he gets defeated. And he might have known that he needs to do what he must until the point of defeat, potentially telling that to Historia... Or not, it's just speculation at this point."
YakiBacki,-delightfull-,"Also about the Warhammer, he ate Billy thinking he was the holder of it so he didn't know who the shifter was until Lara revealed herself"
YakiBacki,Soul_theorist,"Alright yacki, I agree with you. This is certainly not an unpopular thought process, it's right along with eren showed grisha something before the attack Titan was passed on. I believe eren may have either told her the complete plan truthfully, or he may have lied about the ending,but told her everything other than that. The former seems more likely with the number of chapters we have left. Well, you didn't say much though, but what do you think about me having a child?"
Soul_theorist,YakiBacki,"I dunno, is there a farmer or someone who used to throw rocks at you nearby? If so go for it!"
YakiBacki,Soul_theorist,"I guess that means the father isn't eren. Thank you for taking part in this simulation, I will now run this test on more people."
YakiBacki,tonyfrancois,can you provide a tl;dr
tonyfrancois,YakiBacki,"In chapter 130, it feels like there is a missing bit in the conversation between Eren and Historia. This is due to the fact that Historia seemed to be against the rumbling initially and also due to the way Isayama cuts away from their conversation and then comes back and Historia is seemingly on the side of Eren.

Isayama has cut away important revelation moments in the past, only to reveal them at the highest point of drama in the story.

Hence, why I believe there is a missing piece of information/dialogue that was skipped between the two of them that is related to the conclusion and also the reason why we have seen very little of either of them - they hold the key to the ending."
YakiBacki,dead44ron,"That's the potent copium I needed after reading this mess of a chapter.
I seriously hope you are right.
Still, I doubt 2 chapters will be enough for the reveal AND a satisfying conclusion."
YakiBacki,meekoman1994,"Yea especially with the baby being born at the same time as Zeke dieing, makes me suspect that Eren was using the war hammer titan to stay in Paradis and will go to Historia and hold the baby and say you are free, reactivating the rumbling and ending the series."
YakiBacki,jrvbwr34bhcmdl,"Chekovs baby is absolutely 100% happening. Isayama probably thought his readers forgot but i'm actually surprised how everyone remembered a detail that was brought up once and never shown again. The only-reveal-as-its happening is also a tool that Isayama uses to yes I believe we are getting a reveal of their full conversation at some point. The only Chekovs gun left after the monkey baby would be Levi or Mikasa using titan strength/powers, that and maybe Levi or Mikasa (Mikasa most likely) inheriting each other's battle prowess after one of them dies. 

I also agree that the rumbling isn't completely over because they only killed the ""Major"" parasite (https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lfrk09/137_theory/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"
YakiBacki,Niasmata,"Eren didn‚Äôt plan on anything except rumbling everything outside of Paradis, given how limited his future sight is. And frankly, he‚Äôs not that smart to come up with something more complicated than full rumbling either.

Edit: why don‚Äôt you discuss the much bigger elephant in the room that is Historia‚Äôs baby proposal being juxtaposed with Zeke discussing romantic love? This is literally the context of her question to Eren."
Niasmata,YakiBacki,"Because I'm not trying to weigh in my opinion on who the father is. That's a whole different topic that has been discussed multiple times already.

I'm not trying to imply from this post that Eren is the father, but that Eren gave Historia some extra bit of information that we haven't seen. Hence, why she is on Eren's side, while seemingly being against him before the cutaway, regardless of who the baby daddy is."
YakiBacki,Niasmata,"Because you‚Äôre saying that the missing the part of this dialogue has something to do with Eren‚Äôs plan (even though we already know it‚Äôs the rumbling, unless you believe he‚Äôs pulling the Lelouch bullshit after genociding half of the population). And since Floch and Eren‚Äôs convo was used to fill in the gap between Eren informing Historia about his intentions and her immediately reaction, we can safely assume that Zeke and Eren‚Äôs convo, which had nothing to do with any plans or schemes whatsoever, was used to bridge Eren‚Äôs the worst girl line and Historia‚Äôs baby proposal, meaning that the part of conversation that was skipped had nothing to with any kind of a plan either."
YakiBacki,TheSurveyCorpses,"TBH for a long time I hoped that there was something extra to that conversation mostly because I hate what the whole pregnancy storyline did to Historia's character. But at this point I'm convinced that Historia's answer was basically her way of challenging Eren. ""If you're going to commit genocide to stop me from being forced into getting pregnant, what if I were to get pregnant anyway? There would be no reason for you to do that then, right?""

I feel like at that point Eren gave up, coming to accept that the future he saw was the one that was going to happen no matter how he tried to fight it. I could be completely off the mark here, but if we're to accept that conversation at face value that's my best attempt at making sense of their characters. Still hoping that it's like you said and that there's a twist, though at this point idk how it could save Historia's character."
YakiBacki,Cephardrome,Mhm mhm true true i gree with your statement
YakiBacki,energyuser601,"damn this is a good read! i think ur onto something, i saw some ch 138 leaks off twitter saying >! eren is in paradis and will touch historia‚Äôs baby after it inherits zeke‚Äôs powers, thus starting the rumbling again||. it‚Äôll be interesting to see if that does happen, and if Isayama does include Eren and Historia‚Äôs conversation/plans !<"
energyuser601,YakiBacki,"I think those leaks are fake as it is very early to have that sort of info, unless it's coming from someone very close to Isayama. They probably spawned from people wanting that to be true."
YakiBacki,BlueZ00,"This is a good dose of hopium. I did not liked the events leading up this so yes, I am still hoping for one final twist that can save everything."
YakiBacki,gjkkj,Can I have tldr
YakiBacki,anonymous_idunno,This post single handedly restored all my copium reserves.  Bye bye doomchads.
YakiBacki,Nerohn,"Something that has continued to bug me is why did Eren say those awful things to Armin and Mikasa, so it would be easier for them to view him as an object to defeat, so they would hate him more to actually be able to defeat him? I have a feeling he is planning for his ultimate defeat, and telling them that is only a facilitation of his defeat. I mean, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve been saying, with the founding titans power he could simply just kill them all or stop them in place or prevent the shifters from shifting, but they all are acting out of free will. Although Eren did promise them true freedom, and I guess they have it.... AH, yams, give us the next chapter already! This is worse than how 136 left off!! I need resolution!"

knightingale74,Glad_Artichoke6629,It stayed more than a day when episode 1 released
RenaudBlais2,Xehanz,FMAB was at 9.23 before the great FMAB Vs AoT S3 part 2 war.
ClarityInMadness,ThePreciseClimber,"You do realise both specials count as one on MAL, right? This score was there for the past half a year.

Also, it's lower than it was before."
ThePreciseClimber,medievalknight12,The glazers gonna argue it's fmab and op fans downvoting tho
medievalknight12,ledelius,this is somewhat unrelated but I think there's nothing more childish and chronically online than downvoting a show only so that it doesn't surpass your favourite show's ratings on a random internet site that only weeb use
medievalknight12,Furkota,"It's most likely them, too"
medievalknight12,Hange11037,That is definitely at least a portion of it though
ThePreciseClimber,swegling,"also scrolling down and actually looking at the reviews might give a better idea of what people are thinking, because many people just vote 10/10 because they are ""big fans"".

[here](https://i.imgur.com/q4fp8OD.png) are the reviews from yesterday, before the episode had released, and [here](https://i.imgur.com/ZocOVz6.png) is what they are now. so out of 90 new reviews, only 48 are positive. that's not what an overly positive reception looks like"
swegling,PaleFollowing8752,tbf thats because a lot of people from this sub are review bombing lets be real
swegling,Raidoton,Stop being in denial. Comments everywhere outside of circlejerks like this are positive. The IMDB score is also already at an 8: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27048168/?ref_=tt_eps_rec
swegling,mg10pp,"Sorry but if you were a regular user of Mal you would know that the reviews under popular anime should just be ignored, the staff occasionally tries to invent new methods but generally since a few years ago those with the low ratings are in disproportionate number and often at the top whatever the series is"
ThePreciseClimber,Vitaly-unofficial,It's actually back in the top 5 right now. It used to be at 12th spot a few days before the final episode came out.
ThePreciseClimber,Inevitable-Benefit79,well the episodic rating is 4.6 and 4.2 for the respective specials. so I don't think the reception is as poor as the manga
ThePreciseClimber,Raidoton,Well it's an 8 on imdb so needless to say anime onlies liked it: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27048168/?ref_=tt_eps_rec
ClarityInMadness,AOEHopeChad,"Good for them honestly. The toned down ending made it easier to enjoy. 

I still don't like it, but I'm glad so many people could enjoy the entire story and not just 90% like I did."

ClarityInMadness,Agitated-Trash-7801,It's a lot easier to have ur emotions manipulate by TV productions with dramatic music plying and the actors acting dramatically vs a Manga
Agitated-Trash-7801,lokotrono,"Using that same logic, we could conclude that all entertainment is manipulation, even manga"
lokotrono,AssassinOfFate,"It‚Äôs true. The purpose of art is manipulate people into feeling what the artist wants them to feel. The better they are at manipulation, the better the art is as a result."
lokotrono,Agitated-Trash-7801,You wouldn't be wrong
Agitated-Trash-7801,knie20,Blud thinks he's objective because he read the still pictures and the still words üíÄ
Agitated-Trash-7801,raidriar889,Is manipulating your emotions not the entire purpose of literally all entertainment? What a stupid thing to say to disparage anime-onlies who enjoyed the ending.
raidriar889,Consistent_Address_3,The manipulation in this case was to mask the rushed writing and plot holes - and anime onlies totally bought into it
raidriar889,Agitated-Trash-7801,"No the purpose of entertainment is to entertain

 seriously though of course to manipulate your emotions to some degree is one of its purposes what im saying is TV has more ways to do that which in turn makes it easier to get lost in the moment as well it can make lesser moments feel greater then they are especially in casual fans who aren't as in tune with all the details of the series 

Honestly I'd give it a couple years give people time to retrospect and we will slowly see a change in its perception"
ClarityInMadness,TheRedKitsune,MaL has basically every series ranked #1000 or lower hyper inflated with positive reviews tbh
ClarityInMadness,PermissionHot8396,We enjoy 80% they love the remaining 20% too nothing else
ClarityInMadness,teddyperkin,"Anime onlies pretty much watched chapters 134-138 with an amazing soundtrack and pretty good animation before chapter 139.

Watching 134-138 will pretty much keep you excited about the ending while tolerating all the crazy flaws from 139.

As a manga reader is way easier to see through the BS. Isayama/MAPPA were really smart to put everything into one final part.

Can you imagine waiting a week or month, building all the excitement towards the conclusion to finally understand Eren's final plan just for the final anime episode to be crying Eren? They would've really hated the ending."
teddyperkin,offoy,"I never read the manga so I have no idea about any discourse you all had while reading the manga, can you expand on what the flaws are? Like, what you don't like so much in 139?"
offoy,teddyperkin,"There are many inconsistencies really but for me was how disconnected Eren-139 is from OG Eren.

OG Eren: ""I must keep moving forward, even though I despise myself for it and desperately wish I could do it all differently, because that's who I am and have always been, from the very moment I was born into this world - I am free.""

Eren-139: ""I dunno why I did the Rumbling :'( I just wanted the love of the girl who has been obviously obsessed with me since we first met :'( Ymir made me do this to get over her Stockholm Syndrome.""

It just doesnt make sense. He never ever showed any kind of romantic feelings towards Mikasa. He's always shown resolve towards his goals. He wanted to be free and destroy everything outside Paradis but it now turns out that he was just aiming for 80% to give Paradis a chance? He was confused about it?

Annie and Pieck are all cool with Eren ? Mikasa has a connection with Ymir as an Ackerman?

Cherry on the top is Eren saying ""Only Ymir knows"" instead of actually answering all the plot holes. Really dissapointing considering the AoT always made sense and everything used to be quite well connected and explained. Literally everything happened for the reason.. until it just didnt."
offoy,Consistent_Address_3,"The real reason people hate 139 is because they‚Äôre upset eren got mischaracterised - really? bro was never going to finish the genocide? Is that consistent with the guy we know up til now? And somehow 80% of the world still had to die because hur dur I is idiot? Excuse me whaat???????

Some people have trouble expressing it so they default to meming the 10 years at least scene.

Honestly the other criticisms on Ymir having Stockholm syndrome or  mikasa walking through the ocean are nitpicks imo - nobody reasonable gets hung on for 2 years over that"
ClarityInMadness,Atrenu,"Listen, if they enjoyed the ending, even with it's flaws and questionable dialogue... good. I, for one, am glad they enjoyed something that I could not overlook the flaws in, even when it was still leagues better than the manga's ending.

I'm reminded of a quote from The Wise Man's Fear: ""Anyone can love a thing because. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something despite. That is rare and pure and perfect."""

Hilarial,jackinwol,"Very quickly turning into it. This place will likely have weirdos seething about an anime ending for years to come. It‚Äôs just not that deep. I think it‚Äôs because they invest far too much emotion and energy into something that is ultimately out of their control. So when it doesn‚Äôt go exactly how they prefer, it makes them angry. They lash out at anybody else who *did* enjoy it or found entertainment, and it sort of becomes a cycle of self-fulfilling bitterness at that point."

ClarityInMadness,Haise01,"I thought it was obvious most people would enjoy, most of my friends wanted Eren to be stopped and like the ending. Also there's the fact that Mikasa, Armin and Levi survived and their fanbase is huge, that alone already makes fans happy."
ClarityInMadness,Sweet-Stable4044,check the imdb and then we'll talk
Sweet-Stable4044,Surebutnotreally,It's mostly 10/10
ClarityInMadness,shining-moon,"i asume most anime onliesdont remember most plotponint story due to the fact that they are not too much  invested into the story as well as hoe t S4 was released .

 but still  , i am not able to understand them .why they cant see the flaws plot holes and character regression?"
shining-moon,ExploringSouls,It was the same for manga readers. It took some time until people started to realize the errors.
ClarityInMadness,ElKonyo,The rating is hight because of the first episode
ClarityInMadness,Light_HolyPaladin,They probably forgot what happened even in the last part (since it was realeased a year ago). They don't analyze every page every month like us who actually care about story.  They watch sakuga animation and this is enough for them.
Light_HolyPaladin,BamilleKidanZ,"Rereading manga is faster than rewatching anime so I think some anime-onlies would eventually noticed the flaws after rewatching, just that it would take more time.
 
There's no salvation for sakuga simp though. Don't get me wrong, enjoying sakuga is fine, but deciding an anime is the best solely on it is not."
Light_HolyPaladin,Snigeltakt,‚ÄùPeople liking something I DON‚ÄôT LIKE? No I don‚Äôt want that! I want to continue circlejerking for 10 more years at least!‚Äù
Light_HolyPaladin,Wilczek_7,Damn you sound just sad.
Light_HolyPaladin,shaqkage,"Yo be honest do you actually think you are superior to people who only watch the anime

Manga reader here."
shaqkage,Light_HolyPaladin,"I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù. I just know that I, ‚Äúending hater‚Äù, cared for story more than most of them who will just watch it, rate it 10/10, forget it next hour, and continue to watch some random harem isekai and probably have same level of enjoyment as AOT. They are easy to impress. There are sure a lot of manga readers like that too but anime onlies still feel much more like masses who are just happy that something moving on the screen. I don‚Äôt hate them for it. I do same with more simple and comedy animes and just not thinking much about the story but AOT is special for me and it pains me then I see people who spend no good time with AOT (most of them probably don‚Äôt even rewatch it and watch next part next year. Spend 1 hour a year) and they try to convince me how everything makes sense."
Light_HolyPaladin,1095212dinomike,Yall sound so miserable it's astounding. I think they just liked the story more than you broski.
Light_HolyPaladin,RenaudBlais2,You seem to forget that the anime changed up a lot of scenes and generally improved on the ending
RenaudBlais2,Light_HolyPaladin,It is like 1 on 1 except 2 more minutes of Eren and Armin bitching about how it was all for nothing and they didn‚Äôt solve shit. Not much of improvement.
Light_HolyPaladin,mg10pp,Damn if Titanfolk users carefully analyze every single page so much and still come up with so many shit and absurd takes then maybe they need to work a bit on our comprehension skills...
Light_HolyPaladin,majeboy145,If y‚Äôall ‚Äúcare about the story‚Äù why can‚Äôt you accept it?
majeboy145,Light_HolyPaladin,Because story failed itself. Writer failed it.
ClarityInMadness,Utahraptor505,"It's also gone up on imdb 

Yesterday it was at 6.2, today its at 8.0"
Utahraptor505,mg10pp,"Yeah it's a long story regarding One Piece fans on Imdb or something but basically some thousand of downvoting haters were among the first to rate it, so while for the old episodes with over 50k votes they didn't change much in this case they had much more impact"

ClarityInMadness,RabbitTank0418,"To be honest the anime was way better than the manga in terms of presentation with the additional dialogs instead of just "" I have no idea""."
RabbitTank0418,Consistent_Address_3,Yeah they changed it to I am an idiot teehee
ClarityInMadness,matt_619,"Why are you so butthurt if some people like the ending? not everyone have to share opinion as you. people can enjoy and like whatever they wanted

I hated the ending but i don't condemn people for not sharing my opinion"
ClarityInMadness,br1nsk,"What‚Äôs become abundantly clear to me, and what should have been clear a while ago, is that the way you perceive the ending is completely dependent on how you perceive Eren. 

Most people on this sub don‚Äôt buy the idea that he had no idea what he was doing the whole time, and that the way he acts in the end is a mischaracterisation of him. I think this is a fair critique. 

However, if you simply take the story at face value, the way he‚Äôs characterised is a lot easier to stomach. Whilst the ending has other issues, whether you‚Äôll enjoy it or not is solely based on how you feel about how Eren is handled. Everything else that happens in the ending isn‚Äôt too bad, and imo is pretty decent. If you viewed Eren as someone who never changed before this, then the ending makes sense. The problem is that a lot of people were under the impression he DID change, and that makes the choices with his character confusing and frustrating. 

Additionally, the final episode is a lot better than the final chapter. If you ignore story and just judge it on production value, it‚Äôs a great episode. Great animation, great voice acting, and great music. They even got Linked Horizon back. It‚Äôs a very enjoyable episode for those reasons alone. Plus the minor story and dialogue changes were good. 

Ultimately the reaction isn‚Äôt very surprising. Titanfolk has always been a bit of an echo chamber, as most subreddits are, so it‚Äôs easy to forget that a lot of people do not share the issues we have with the ending. I think in time people will be a bit more harsh on the conclusion, as people spend more time analysing the story as a whole. 

We‚Äôll have to wait and see."
br1nsk,ClarityInMadness,"Nah, there's still plenty of wacky nonsense even without Eren.

1. The entire team having plot armor and not dying to dozens of titans + having infinite gas
2. Necrokiss
3. The ""source of all living matter"" or whatever the fuck, la creatura that was introduced near the end, killed, and then the characters just forgot about it and it was never mentioned again
4. ""Historia's handwriting smells so nice""
5. Connie and Jean getting turned into titans only to be turned back into humans 5 minutes later
6. Mikasa swimming/walking hundreds of miles on foot all the way back to Paradis, with no food or transportation, while carrying Eren's head

Etc."
ClarityInMadness,Deserteagle7,"To be fair, these are all nitpicks beyond the plot armor one, but even that isn't objectively bad, just annoying. The kiss really isn't a big deal, there are tons of scenes of people kissing their lovers as they die in media, the Hallucegenia is annoying to me too but its not like I expect Isayama to go into detail about the origins of it as that's kind of the point of soft magic systems(which it essentially is), Reiner sniffing the letter while weird is not a big deal, the fake out deaths is stupid but again is not bad enough to treat as a dealbreaker for the ending, and the Mikasa travel thing could be explain in some ways like there being some surviving boats or something. There are some legitimate criticisms with the ending and some fairly big ones too, but like the other guy said none are really too big to overlook(though they hamper enjoyment to degrees and make it worse) if you are okay with the core of the ending which is Eren, which will vary for people."
ClarityInMadness,Consistent_Address_3,"my friend all of that is tied back to eren - if he wasn‚Äôt mischaracterised and actually did his damn genocide by blowing up the alliance airship before they could ride it or something,

No plot armor for entire team, no necrokiss because eren survives, no mikado traversing the entire world, hallucigenia could go away if eren did some magic stuff using his founder ability(yeah this is bs but u know what I mean)

Historia sniff was peak fiction and if u disagree I will kill myself"
ClarityInMadness,br1nsk,"Yeah but ultimately these are mostly all nitpicks and not major issue, they are far less divisive. 

1- Plot armour is extremely common in anime and manga these days, and frankly the main cast of AoT has always had some. It does get stretched quite far in the finale which has always personally annoyed me but it also isn‚Äôt outside the bounds of reason for these characters. 

2- Never understood this subs issue with the necrokiss. Not only is it an incredibly common trend in media for characters to kiss their dead loved ones, it‚Äôs also quite common in real life. Certainly isn‚Äôt the disgusting thing people make it out to be. 

3- The source of all living matter is an actual glaring issue that definitely takes away from the ending, but ultimately it wasn‚Äôt essential to the narrative. It being kind of ignored at the end is mainly just dissatisfying. 

4- Again, nitpick. I don‚Äôt love this moment either but it lasts about 5 seconds. It‚Äôs a joke at the expense of Reiner‚Äôs character, but a joke nonetheless and isn‚Äôt meant to be taken that seriously. 

5- I did not like this either, one of my biggest problems with the ending is that besides Hange the alliance took no major casualties, and the final battle against tens of the strongest titans in history actually went absurdly well for them. Transforming everyone to Titans was done for shock value, but it is instantly diminished by them all turning back straight away. Imo either Connie or Jean should have died. Or both. 

6- Minor issue. Obviously not great Isayama didn‚Äôt explain this, but also people have an incredibly bad  faith interpretation of it here. She obviously didn‚Äôt swim across, she waited with the alliance and went back with them. She walks off at the end because she probably wants a moment alone. I also doubt Eren‚Äôs decapitated head is rotting with her the whole time, it was probably turned into a skull or something. 

Anyway my point is that those are all not huge issues that ruin the ending. If you were happy with how Eren‚Äôs character resolved, but all of this still happened, I promise you wouldn‚Äôt still be here 2 years later complaining about the ending."
ClarityInMadness,Good-Cash2177,It‚Äôs easy to enjoy it when they didn‚Äôt spend the last 2 years of existence hating it.
Good-Cash2177,SHAGGYOop,"That's probably why lmao. When I first read the last chapter two years ago, I remember having a list of things in my mind that I hated about it. But, now it's all a blur. After the manga ended, I stopped caring about the series altogether and now I don't remember what I liked and disliked about the show altogether"
ClarityInMadness,KingDennis2,"Told y'all mfs they would love it. I guarantee it doesn't drop below an 8 at the lowest. Go to almost any forum or app and read the anime only comments, they love the ending and most don't seem to find any real issues in it. But to begin with most anime only expected and had the opposite views of this sub"
KingDennis2,jackinwol,"Yeah I loved it. It was fun, cool, and entertaining. Pretty much the main reasons that anybody engages with entertainment to begin with, so. I gain nothing by over-analyzing it, and that‚Äôs not why people watch stuff to begin with anyways. It was a dope original idea anime with crazy twists. 

What show should I watch next though? I‚Äôm thinking Baki or Death Note"
jackinwol,KingDennis2,Depends on what you like but I think those are both really good shows. I've been watching Jujutsu Kaisen rn and it's really good

ClarityInMadness,ItalianIrredentist,"Heh, whatever.
I stopped caring a long time ago

Maybe I‚Äôll leave this sub now that it‚Äôs finally all over. Maybe that was what Isayama truly meant by freedom all along, not freedom in a general sense, freedom for Eren, freedom from the cycle of violence or freedom from oppression for the Eldians, but instead freedom from his shitty series."

If AOT was to get an animated movie, what chapter do you think it will start from?"
Keye_Necktire,No-Seaweed-4456,"Let‚Äôs do some math. If the current season 4 ended at chapter 119, that‚Äôd leave 20 chapters left to adapt. They adapt roughly 2 chapters an episode, meaning there‚Äôd be hypothetically 10 episodes left. 22 minute episodes (excluding the credits) would make this equivalent to 220 minutes of content, or 3 hours 40 minutes. If it ended at 122, that‚Äôd leave 187 minutes (3 hours 7 minutes) left of content. I doubt a company would be willing to fund a 3-4 hour movie like this."

Lol I will literally link this post to everyone in the discussion thread while jumping around the house."
Matt_37,elxdark,"Interesting take on the missing memories (Grisha and Historia) I also think they are tied to the curse, and I‚Äôm 10000000% sure Isayama will show us them in the next chapter, I thought the Grisha‚Äôs one was going to appear last chapter but  now thinking about it, it makes much more sense to connect it with Historia and Eren final flashback.

Can‚Äôt comment too much about the rest because I‚Äôm still digesting the chapter and clearing out my thoughts on it, but well done it was fun to see something different than ‚ÄúEren is in Paradis and will use his baby to kill his friends‚Äù while also destroying his entire character by doing it, yeah no.

I‚Äôve said a lot of times but Ymir‚Äôs wish is the key to solve the ending."

> I‚Äôve said a lot of times but Ymir‚Äôs wish is the key to solve the ending.

Yes, I have that impression as well, even more so after 137. The whole volume 34 teaser has this as a theme too... Fuck! I just noticed I forgot to include it in the theory.

>  ‚ÄúEren is in Paradis and will use his baby to kill his friends‚Äù

I was originally on this theory's camp, but I've since changed my stance after I started fiddling with SNK content and trying to wrap my head around 137, which actually led me to put this post together. I do still think the baby's royal blood will be important - I'm not sure why it had to be Historia's, and that's bothering me."

m_bozwell,Matt_37,"Thanks!

> I do wanna ask when you say eren is sleep the whole time, what exactly do you mean by that?

I mean he's willingly choosing to not take action against the alliance's efforts, and appears to be in a dream-like state, as shown by his POV in chapter 131 and apparent complete lack of a physical form bar a head.

> I‚Äôve heard some theories that he‚Äôs still back on paradis crystallized by use of the war hammer titans powers

I'm not really onboard with that theory for quite a few reasons, but a simple one would be that [Eren's head](https://cdn.readshokugeki.com/file/mangap/5339/10131000/40.jpeg) is shown to be inside a titan-like organism, just like the one a shifter's head usually would be in when in titan form."
Matt_37,Cersei505,"I dont believe your theory simply because it hinges on the fact that:

1 - eren is not interested in doing a full rumbling anymore

2 - eren needed the alliance to kill the origin of the titans.

Why? Eren can literally command the colossal titans to kill the spine creature if he wanted to. Ymir herself could've done that, and yet he had to wait for the alliance to come and kill him, so he could get rid of that spine creature? This seems like an overcomplicated plot to try to fix plot holes in the final fight."
Cersei505,Matt_37,"Those are valid points, for sure. Thanks for bringing them up.

> 1 - eren is not interested in doing a full rumbling anymore

I don't see how that contradicts the theory, though. Theoretically, the more rumbled the world gets, the merrier for Eldia, since it means less military threat. I don't think Eren would have suddenly stopped rumbling had the alliance not come. A full scale rumbling would be a solid backup plan, but I don't think that was ever an option if Eren saw future memories of what would happen.

> 2 - eren needed the alliance to kill the origin of the titans. Why?

That's a very good question. If the theory is true, it'll depend on Isayama's execution to explain it satisfyingly. What I will say, though, again, is that it might be that Eren saw it happen in future memories. Reiner's involvement, see you later, you get the gist of it.

Truthfully though, if the theory does come out to be true, we'll probably just have to handwave that part to Isayama wanting to give a final battle and closure to the alliance characters, unfortunately.

> This seems like an overcomplicated plot to try to fix plot holes in the final fight.

I'll be disagreeing with you here - the biggest element of the final fight my post touches on is how Eren was basically numb all throughout it.

And I highly, highly doubt Isayama forgot Eren was there, or something along those lines. We have a panel of his head with his eyes closed, and his POV has been missing for the entirety of the battle. To my interpretation, at least, it seems that his non-response to their attacks is intentional.

Again, thanks for leaving a comment with counterpoints, it really puts the theory to the test."
Matt_37,Chad111,"On point 2.

The origin may not allow suicide? As in, it may have a way of stopping anyone who hosts the founder from using it‚Äôs powers to kill it specifically, the whole ‚Äúfear for survival‚Äù thing. He may have actually needed the alliance to kill it, and to hate him to get them to do so. 

He did say they were still free, so even though they‚Äôre using it‚Äôs powers, ymir / eren could be holding it back from stopping the shifters, since they have their own will that she / eren are protecting. Maybe eren could not make it destroy itself since it was in part of him, but he could enable his friends to do so?"
Matt_37,Cersei505,"'' I don't think Eren would have suddenly stopped rumbling had the alliance not come. A full scale rumbling would be a solid backup plan, but I don't think that was ever an option if Eren saw future memories of what would happen. ''

&#x200B;

Then why did he go out of his way to say he wouldnt stop moving forward no matter what ,even if the alliance tried to stop him? Why did he say in chapter 123 that he would flatten the entire world, and kill everyone outside of paradis? He was very specific about everything he said and wanted.

The only explanation to fit in your theory...was that eren didnt mean any of that and was manipulating people to hate him, so he could be stopped midway through the rumbling, which imo is character assassination for Eren. 

Even now, in chapter 137, if Eren was given the chance, i'm pretty sure he would restart the rumbling all over again.

&#x200B;

'' What I will say, though, again, is that it might be that Eren saw it happen in future memories. Reiner's involvement, see you later, you get the gist of it. ''

&#x200B;

So just because he saw it, he doesnt try to change it? This coming from the character that embodies the themes of freedom in this story, just submitting entirely to the visions he saw?

&#x200B;

'' we'll probably just have to handwave that part to Isayama wanting to give a final battle and closure to the alliance characters, unfortunately. ''

&#x200B;

That sadly seems more likely by the day, which is imo pretty bad writting. 

&#x200B;

'' I'll be disagreeing with you here - the biggest element of the final fight my post touches on is how Eren was basically numb all throughout it. ''

&#x200B;

I dont think you got my point. I said it would be an overcomplicated attempt to fix the plot holes, meaning that all this ''eren somehow needed the alliance to attack him to kill hallucigenia thingy'' is actually unnecessary asf and shouldnt even be a plot point in the first place, since him or Ymir could take care of that."

Matt_37,buttcheeksontoast,"I'm a little not sold only because the factor of the rumbling... The survivors within can say whatever they want, the outside world after seeing the death and destruction will take zero chances and hunt down every last Eldian to be killed. To the world, who can really prove another rumbling won't finish what Eren started?"
buttcheeksontoast,Matt_37,"Good point. I guess it depends on how many humans are actually left in the world, which we might learn in the last 2 chapters."
Matt_37,nutsackhurts,"or maybe the colossals have now become mindless and will continue to kill everything and everyone.

nutsackhurts,Matt_37,"I don't see it going that way anymore, but that would have been ironic."
Matt_37,Inside-Medicine-1349,Why would the world leave them alone after most of it was rumbled?
Inside-Medicine-1349,Matt_37,"Yeah, it wouldn't, I don't think. But Fort Salta is said to be ""the last bastion of humanity"" in 134, so I guess the number of humans left depends on how figuratively we take that line."
Matt_37,kub3r,"This makes no sense. Eren has now killed millions of people around the world with the rumbling. And now after supposedly freeing eldians from the curse of ymir, how are they going to protect themselves from the nations when they seek revenge against paradis?"
kub3r,Matt_37,"Admittedly, that is the weakest part of my theory. I think it depends on how much of the world has been rumbled, and, depending how that plotline goes, how much influence Secretary M√ºller has over other military leaders."
Matt_37,Khazu_,"Very good theory. The only thing that differs from my viewpoint is Eren dying. In my opinion he is making through it till the end. For me there are two evidence for that.

1st being Reiner not understanding Eren in terms of ""We are the same"". In war of paradis he assumed that Eren just want to die but then the looks he gives in his Titan gvies me vibe this is totally opposite. He wants to make throught it cuz off...

2nd being words of song ""Zero Eclipse"". The 1st part of the song is definitely about 104th Ymir and Historia but the 2nd part is about Eren and Historia.

In this part Historia is asking Eren that everything he has done till this points has any meaning  if he has no desire to comeback. That's why she is asking retorically if being paying for all youve done just by dying is being a Hero? the answer is...

>You're bigger

In her eyes if he doesn't come back from it alive he is zero. What's the point of doing all of it if you won't come back alive? (It would be just another Lelouch and I think it destory purpose of two lines -  ""I just keep moving forward"" ""cuz he was born into this world""). Also the hide line pretty much is perfect for what is happening right now. Literally Eren who do you hide?

>Make a promise that I cannot regret  
>  
>As long as I can see you but in secret

This is the part about their meetings in Paradis that nobody knew about. They made a promise to each other that they both won't regret. There is so much other paralels but here are already so much other posts desrcibing it so there is no reason to call it here now.

To sum it up Jean calling Eren suicidal bastard is in my opinion perfect here cuz it was like that for entire series up until chapter 90. Since then it is a total opposite. This guy will just keep moving forward and come back alive to hold his child in final panel. That's propably what Isayama meant when He said Eren will surpass his Father."
Khazu_,Matt_37,"Damn well put, I hadn't ever seen those lyrics! It makes a good amount of sense. I can't wait anymore!"
Matt_37,InRoyal,"I'm not a 100% sure, but Fort Salta should be [where Eren points his finger at](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/c/c7/Yelena_warns_Eren_about_Fort_Salta.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20200909101312).

If we assume, that Eren went the route from our worlds south Arfica stright to fort Salta, most of Europe/Russia/America should be intact. 

But to be honest, Since we have no real infomation on how the world is actually structured, where the heart of the urbanized countrys are, it doesnt really matter. Acrifa (Africa) is completly different from our world ( more like Europe)  and so is probably every other continent as well. Isayama can therefor chose consequences himself no matter how much of the actual world has been rumbled. But if we go by landmass, I would assume about 40-50%."

Matt_37,Niasmata,"What? Get pregnant to make Ymir reborn? Do you even know that Eren wasn‚Äôt even aware of her until he entered PATHS and had to ask Zeke who that girl in the rags was?

Also, the reason why Historia accepted is rumbling is because Eren reminded her that she‚Äôs a fundamentally selfish person that doesn‚Äôt want to sacrifice herself and her children for the sake of the island. That‚Äôs why she kept being silent about the rumbling. The baby has absolutely no role in this."
Niasmata,Matt_37,"> What? Get pregnant to make Ymir reborn? Do you even know that Eren wasn‚Äôt even aware of her until he entered PATHS and had to ask Zeke who that girl in the rags was?

Yeah, I actually replied to a comment earlier saying this and I think I'll just add it to the OP - I was going to include a part on why the baby being Historia's is important, and that it's very likely to do with her royal blood. You're absolutely right that Eren didn't know about Ymir before he got into Paths. That certainly wasn't part of the original plan. Well brought up.

> Also, the reason why Historia accepted is rumbling is because Eren reminded her that she‚Äôs a fundamentally selfish person that doesn‚Äôt want to sacrifice herself and her children for the sake of the island. That‚Äôs why she kept being silent about the rumbling. The baby has absolutely no role in this.

I respectfully disagree. Historia was very clearly vehemently against the rumbling before the dialogue cut to another scene after Eren said that. There's something hidden there - her very next line is ""What do you think of me having a child""?

1. That isn't a natural response to Eren's remark;
2. At this point, their conversation is juxtaposed with Eren and Zeke's conversation about the Ackerman bond of all things.
3. How is a child part of the solution to a situation such as theirs? We know very little about it. I doubt it was just to stall the government.

You're free to have your interpretation of the story, of course, but in my interpretation the baby is actually key to understanding why Historia changed her stance to support Eren. Something was said before and after Historia offered to bear a child, and it's hidden from the readers.

Thanks for the comment though, made me notice a glaring mistake lol."
Matt_37,Niasmata,"Historia was on board with 50 years plan and wanted to sacrifice herself and her progeny because she was regressing into Krista (a martyr, basically). Eren wanted to remind her that‚Äôs she not like that and she‚Äôs pretty selfish person to the core, hence his ‚Äúthe worst girl‚Äù comment. You can even see Historia‚Äôs eyes spark with hope when Eren told her that he won‚Äôt sacrifice her before saying that she will do everything in her power to stop him, she never really wanted to have her children bred and killed like livestock. 

The narrative point of Zeke and Eren‚Äôs convo about Mikasa is to discuss the romantic feelings she harbours for Eren, not the ackerbond, which as we know isn‚Äôt even real.

The baby wasn‚Äôt needed for any kind of plan. Historia simply wanted to have a child (you know, like women do it irl?). Eren nor Historia would never be okay with brining a child in this world for some ulterior motive, considering that they both were used by their fathers in the past. You simply don‚Äôt understand Historia‚Äôs character arc not the themes about the importance of children and love in the final arc."
Matt_37,arnav1311,"I have been saying something similar all along. I've been saying this in the leaks thread and the discussion thread. You have just articulated it in a much better way. Well done. I think this is the only theory that makes sense because it is line with all the character arcs, and the themes of the story.

Eren has to die. Sorry yaegerbros. He's already so guilty that he's in a dream state to avoid pain of what he's doing. He simply won't be able to live a normal life if he survives this. He isn't a god. He is just a person who's dying from the inside at the thought of the atrocities he is committing. But he will die according to his own volition and plan. 

It's something similar to code Geass, not exactly though. The way it's done is drastically different. Eren has already rumbled most of the world. He's already killed billions. The themes are different. But it is Eren sacrificing himself for the future of his people and friends."
arnav1311,Matt_37,"Thanks! That's the gist of my interpretation of Eren's character as well - many of the most recent traits people see in him stem from the rumbling / the plan to rumble, but I don't think we've seen his whole plan yet.

Man I really need to watch Code Geass lol"
Matt_37,CRAZYPLATlNUM,"I think you have the gist of what happens, as its similar to waht i think will happen. But im not sure eren is dead, and infact we may see his original attack titan form one last time. I think theres one more physical/action scene left, like ""moving the boulder"". also i think ymirs motivations will also be exposed, and i think this includes rebuilding the world. Also im not totally sure the rumblign is done. paradis needs the safety and the world will not unite against common enemy and celebrate eldia, they will turn on them. only the witnesses at fort salta may accept eldians ( i do think they live)."

BrunoSaurio,Matt_37,"Thank you!

Ymir's character was done sooooo dirty in this ending man. So much was left unexplained too, and I'm talking relevant things like what the hell happened to Ymir and Paths, and what was the true reason Historia had a child. I'm of the opinion Isayama could have made the ending so much better if only he expanded the story by three-ish more chapters... but we got what we did."
Matt_37,Accelerator-Deflect,Im cool with this i guess (Fuck you Gabi) but that means that the rest of the world will just magically have a peace treaty right? Very anti climatic if you ask me.
Accelerator-Deflect,Matt_37,"Yeah, pretty much. I also think it's pretty idealistic and out of touch with reality, but I  guess a peace treaty is set up to happen already with Secretary Muller (who just changed his mind because he crapped his pants) and the Eldian families, which to our knowledge might actually be the effective remnants of mankind that will help rebuild the society our cast will spend the rest of their years... 

But there's bound to be conflict again in the future. I'd be surprised if the epilogue doesn't mention rising tensions or anything. It's just part of human nature."

Matt_37,Friend_of_Eevee,It's like you took part of my theories out of my head and fleshed them out. I basically agree with all of this. What did it for me was the panels a few chapters ago showing Ymir really was the one who let the pigs out after all. Why?? Freedom. She knew the punishment but death would be freedom for a slave who knew no happiness. She has been trying to get free ever since. Paths is like a purgatory that she and the other shifters have been trapped in for eons.
Matt_37,Proxy_of_Death,"Overall, this is good stuff, just will like to expand on somethings

>Eldians are forever free from the Curse of Ymir, but they also lose their (by far) biggest military advantage. That is why Eren saw the rumbling as necessary -

I think it is likely that his plan is much more multifaceted, if not intentional then it is very effective.

First is that the rumbling could also unite the outside world and Eldians as seen in 136. This further expands on why Eren pushed his friends away and made them hate him. By not allowing the SC to take part in this Eren is the perfect scapegoat since he doesn't represent Paradis' government. So there is a way to guarantee Paradis' safety. Also, Magath.

As I have said many times this isn't Lelouch, a better reference will Ozymandias' plan for world peace in Watchmen. There are some differences though.

>And this is the part where I lose most of my yeagerbros - the real world Eren is either already dead (Gabi snipe‚Ñ¢), or about to die.

This one I had a problem with. In 120, Zeke said to Eren _I have been waiting for so long Eren, for you to recover and awaken._ It's like I've been sitting here for a year.

So it seems Eren was rebuilt in paths likely by Ymir. Also, I don't think Eren wants to die, I don't think Ymir will let him since he is the only one she has a connection with.

>When Eren and Zeke are going on their Paths adventure, Grisha remarks to Zeke that everything is going to go Eren's way, and asks Zeke to stop Eren.

Grisha saw Zeke because Eren sent him memories of him and he even positioned himself opposite Zeke in 121 to make this possible. I think it was intentional.

All this is just speculation."

Actually, well brought up. I didn't remember that!

Do you mean it was intentional on Eren's part to let Grisha ask Zeke to stop him? That's an interesting take. It could well be possible."

Even in code geass it went to shit... pains plan was to actually give MDW to every village... etc. Here is all different."
ErwinSmith_GOAT,Huhwtfbleh,"Well. Given how the alliance can't stop winning against literal god. It's very obvious that the rumbling will stop.

Right, so I scrapped this last minute. I was going to include that royal blood, despite all our headcanons since 122, *is actually a thing of importance*. So that's why the baby Ymir is going to be reborn into **needs** to be Historia's, and that's why Zeke's death was indeed necessary to stop the rumbling.

He isnt doing it to unite the world nor do i think thats what will happen. hes doing it to achieve both his goals: rumbling, and saving his friends and paradis.

We will probably see why they are necessary for that goal (all 9 shifters are present, eren/ymir probably gave falco the flying titan to bring him and annie there)"

Humble_Let1735,nostrangerstlove,"Nah it fell when the alliance members didn't even fight about allegiances within themselves. We all know for a fact that Connie and Mikasa should have been for Eren even if the ways Eren accomplishes their goal is not something they completely agree with. Connie of all people should have been a Yeagerist (his mom is turned into a titan; his best friend died by a Marleyan child soldier). Also, it'd be more interesting if Reiner, Connie, or even Jean switched sides in the middle of the battle. Like I really want more of Reiner's double personality and guilt making things complicated. The rumbling lacked that political dilemma the other arcs have. The rest of the characters aside from the main trio became one-dimensional."

Bayro1997,Mountain_Anxiety_492,"The ending is emotionally satisfying for the people who wanted their characters to live a long happy life,(simple as that)but as a story that properly delivers its core themes it did a sloppy job .

As a person that focus more on what the themes the story tried to deliver it definitely misses focus on so many points ,the cycle repeats is not a bad concept ending but the process on how it delivered its theme definitely feel stupid when you remember Eren left 20 percent alive just to make his friends looks like heroes."

WonderfulTraining357,Spenrable,"I 100% agree with the ending completely destroying the themes of the story, but this comment is straight up the definition of gatekeeping. 

Some people might not be looking into AOT as indepth as you are, this doesn't mean they are ""AoT despisers"" or a ""fake fan"". Jesus Christ, stop sounding so fucking pretentious."
Spenrable,AgentApollo,"For real. It's completely fine to not like the ending or how Isayama wrote the last several chapters. It is not however to be pretentious about the story and it's ending (or send death threats to Isayama. Criticize the ending all you like, more power to you, just don't treat the man with such vile contempt after putting out one of the best stories ever written)"
WonderfulTraining357,AgentApollo,"Those who like the ending despise AOT? Bro, there's not enough accurate words to describe how pessimistic and negative that statement is."
WonderfulTraining357,Wannabeartist9974,Can't take seriously if the only thing you are gonna do is write lazy buzzwords.
Wannabeartist9974,WonderfulTraining357,"'ll give you an example: Eren should be the thematic opposite of Zeke in resolving the Eldian issue. This is shown especially in the pregnancy subplot in which she opposes the cycle of children devouring their parents, condemning the new ones to live like cattle and transforming Historia into a machine churning out children to be used as sacrifices for the island. The author has Eren do the Lelouch plan as a plan to resolve the Eldian issue, which as correctly said by Armin, has the same principle as that of the Tybur family and Helos. This is a spit in the face of everything Eren should represent: a solution that condemns the new generations of Paradis to pay for the sins committed by him. Now they will have to try to avoid a war with 20% of the outside world. But what does it matter to you? Your maximum understanding of a written text is limited to the Marvel level"

Bayro1997,No-Mushroom8667,"Erens death was useless, you had us follow the main character on a journey to kill all titans, watch his own mother die in front of him, and experience betrayal like no other. Kill billions of people just to go out like this?? What happened to his dreams? His wishes? His visions?"
Bayro1997,darkgamer_nw,excellent description !
Bayro1997,corona_chan_take_me,"The main reason I even care for Annie as a character is from the Lost Girls story, so I like these ideas on improving her (and tying it in with Levi is a nice touch too, I hadn't considered that). Reiner's crazy plot armor would be acceptable if played a larger role later, either with himself or another titan.

My main changes would be to take out Eren killing his mom (total BS and betrayal, not even going to rework it), and to rework founder Ymir's motivations and resolution‚Äîwhich would also entail giving Historia a real role in the story again, changing the nature of the worm, etc. Also (speaking of Historia) I felt killing off Ymir Freckles so soon, and in that manner, was a waste and a disservice to her character; that's really the only major pre-timeskip change I would make, though I haven't thought out all the details on how I would do it (and frankly I don't think I care enough about the story anymore to work that out completely)."
Bayro1997,ABuddhistMelomaniac,"I would've done two different things for the ending, in fact, I always thought this was how it was gonna end:


1 -Eren accidentally kills everyone (except Armin). He also kills Mikasa in, probably, one of the most ironic and shocking ways possible: by accidentally having Mikasa's scarf (the scarf that Eren gave her and symbolizes her love for him) getting stucked on one of Eren's titan's bony arms (or fingers), choking her or breaking her neck as a consequence. THIS (killing everybody and Mikasa) could've been one of the memories he saw when he kissed Historia and the one thing he wanted to prevent, THAT'S WHY he wanted Mikasa to hate him, so that she would abandon the scarf and PREVENT HER BRUTAL DEATH. That would give Eren's confrontation with Armin and Mikasa (the part where he says he hates her) A LOT MORE PURPOSE and meaning, same with Eren's conversation with Louise telling her to get rid of it (which backfires as Louise ideolizes Mikasa and decides to keep it, making it come back to Mikasa). It always got my attention how the scarf would somehow always return to Mikasa, as if everything was a sick play (as in theatrical play) of fate itself.

2 - This event creates dread, pain and a lot of suffering for both Armin and Eren. Eren decides to send his memories (a scene we haven't even been shown but we know that he did) to other titan shifters, especially Karl Fritz, another attack titan user, Grisha, Falco, and his (Eren's) past self, but not with the intend to fulfill his fate, but to STOP him from even being born. He first sends his memories to Karl Fritz, who goes mad and misinterpets Eren's memories as a divine warning, he misinterpets Eren's and Zeke's titans as ""Devils of the Earth"" and Historia as ""Christa""/Ymir, giving rise to the myth of the Devil of the Earth. He sees these ""devils"" fighting for the Founding Titan to destroy the Earth (but he doesn't see how it's gonna be destroyed). He does see the colossal titans and people migraring to an island in Eren's memories but misinterprets them as a way to prevent the devils (Eren and Zeke) from finding the founder: that being by selling half of the Eldians to Marley, exiling himself to Paradis, creating the walls with the colossals (so that the ""devils of the Earth"" would never find it) and creating the ""Cult of the Walls"". The people from Marely, however, noticed his strange change in personality and decide to capture Karl Fritz (before devising his plan of course) and torture him so that he would reveal what he knows (Marely would be destroyed in 1000 years). This also prompts Marely to request Karl Fritz and Tybur's aid during the Titanomachy, contributing to the capture of all the other titans except the Attack Titan (as he was hiding) in exchange for his liberty. I took inspiration from Greek mythology. You see, in Greek mythology we have the Titans and the Olympian Gods. Among them, you have the titan prometheus and the God Zeus. These are enemies, however, Prometheus (Karl Fritz) helps Zeus (Marely) to win their Titanomachy only if Zeus spared his life, making him (Prometheus) betray his titan brothers by putting them against one another. Prometheus (same as Karl Fritz) also can see into the future (his name literally means ""forethought"") and he sees Zeus' own downfall and how one of his children dethrones him. Zeus captures and tortures him until he tells him who is the one child who would dethrone him, making Zeus also go after his own children to murder them, except for one child he didn't even know he had (which, as expected, was the one who would dethrone him).

That's right baby, Eren sends his memories to Karl Fritz to prevent his own birth, but by doing that, Karl created the conditions (the segregation of Eldians, Paradis and the walls) that brought both Zeke and Eren to life (as well as their motivations). Also, having Karl Fritz seeing Eren's memories would explain where the legend of the world leaders fighting a common powerful enemy (the one told by Pixie) came from, as well as Uri and Frieda knowing about judgement day (cause they receive the memories from their ancestor Karl Fritz, which he got FROM THE FUTURE/EREN). This would also explain WHY they (Mareley and his troops) waited for ONE THOUSAND years before attacking Paradis island and retrieve the founder, cause they knew about their imminent doom and had a better understanding of Karl's ""prophetic"" warning.

Eren also sends his memories to his past self (episode 1), explaing the reason why past Eren wakes up crying but doesn't remember what he saw (Mikasa and friends' deaths, which are actually shown in the anime, but it never amounted to anything).

Oh and EreHisu is canon (cause it made more sense)."
Bayro1997,medievalknight12,Nothing was changed. Isayama even made it worse by making Eren say he was an ordinary idiot who had power.
Bayro1997,RaZoX144,"I don't think the ending was that bad - could be incredible, but turned out meh, and some small changes to the anime made it a bit better, most of the aforementioned problems can be forgiven with small rewriting like you mentioned, or just ignored as inconsistencies.  

What I didn't like is how Eren's character turned out in the final parts and some of the themes of the story did not see full conclusion"
Bayro1997,BladerJoe-,Bro you forgot this is a shounen manga. üíÄ
BladerJoe-,Bayro1997,[Reminds me of this meme](https://imgur.com/a/gxBYqlb)
Bayro1997,arnav1311,"Your annoyance with characters is subjective. I feel with the plot points and inconsistencies, you can call them problems. But character arcs are not something as ""problems"". Connie, Annie, Mikasa especially are just weird criticisms. I can understand Historia, because that's just lazy writing.

Lastly, the ancient titans were never meant to harm the alliance. Ymir gave them plot armour. It's not that they were OP. The final battle was a show for the world that's it. Now you can call it being a show absolute shit, but it's not random and inconsistent."
Bayro1997,SAS-Andy,I AIN'T READING ALL THAT
Bayro1997,shrekman68,"Addressing your 15th problem, eren's didn't have to be said for probably the hundredth time in the story. If people expected something else, their expectations ruined their perception of the ending. 

My interpretation of the Ymir and Mikasa situation is that Ymir was a slave. She has never experienced receiving or  conveying true love. She yearned to experience love, but it wasn't really the case with King Fritz. When she saw Mikasa let go of Eren and her love for him, it showed that Ymir could do the same. The scene showing Ymir hugging her daughters instead of sacrificing her life to save King Fritz shows how she truly loved her daughters and descendants, leading to her erasing the titans.

My memory is a little foggy, but Eren said that the past, future, and present existed at the same time for him. I don't think it's a stretch for him to be able to control pure titans from the past.

The ""Ten years at least"" scene may have been jarring, but given the situation, I would say it's appropriate for Eren to be acting like that. He was holding in his emotions for so long, only to finally be able to let it all out in the presence of his best friend moments away from his death.

Everyone being emotional afterward shows how big empathy as a theme is in the story. That's also why everyone accepted reiner. They still considered him a friend and understood him enough to be emotional about his death.

The ending wasn't pointless just because Beren was hinted to have started the titan curse again. That's the point of the story. It hints to even more conflict occurring in the future, that along with the bombing of paradis. I doubt there will be a sequel. This scene just shows how the nature of humanity never changes."

Bayro1997,CeramicDrip,Post this on the anime sub
Statuecorny,ThePreciseClimber,"It IS pretty frustrating how little AoT anime content we've been getting over the years. Single cours, breaks, delays and now this. 

And, yeah, AoT was a monthly manga, sure. But then so was Fullmetal Alchemist. That franchise provided us with a complete, 52-episode series which got us to its ending in just a year. Sure, half of it wasn't in the manga, but still. 

Then when Brotherhood showed up, it got to its ending in 15 months. 

I do wonder if this kind of approach could've worked for Attack on Titan. A 52-episode adaptation in 2013-2014 where half of it is original and then a loyal adaptation that's \~80 episodes long in 2019-2021."
ThePreciseClimber,RaZoX144,Maybe they will do the opposite approach and we get anime original ending after the manga ends? *\*copium intensifies\**
RaZoX144,MatemanAltobelli,There surely will be slight changes.

Paetolus,ThePreciseClimber,">It's also likely it would have looked rather poor

I mean, even as it is now, AoT has had visible production issues since Season 3. Season 1 got fixed on the Blu-ray but S3&4 only got a few tweaks here and there. 

Even though they abridged the Uprising arc to 10 episodes (when a normal adaptation would've had 15), they still couldn't get it to the same production level as Season 2."

LightThatIgnitesAll,berthototototo,"The storyboard is uncensored, not necessarily the episode as it airs on TV.

Remember there's two kinds of censoring, sometimes they'll change what the injury/angle is and sometimes they'll adapt it faithfully but blur it enough to get past censors (Or if you've seen Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, add a huge shadow over it).

I have no idea why they would draw Eren's decapitated head having a worm shoved through it but not show his head falling off (Going by the main Part 2 trailer) but who knows."
LightThatIgnitesAll,Skyclad__Observer,What the animators are working on and what the leakers may see is probably fully uncensored. I wouldn't expect the network release to be the same way. It's NHK that decides what gets shown at the end of the day.
Skyclad__Observer,berthototototo,This is true too. Much can change in between the storyboarding process and actually animating the episode.

I have no idea how they'll make it work for some areas, but for chapters like Ch127 I hope it gets its own episode. Or at least gets to start off an episode.

The first few episodes are a curious case too. If they're just covering Ch117-119 then we could be getting a situation similar to Episode 24 of S1 where there's a lot of filler in the battle without much happening. Though they might take after the corresponding chapters from the manga and fill the action with more character interactions."

berthototototo,uunam,"I think Episode 3 is going to adapt half of 119 and ""that"" cliffhanger is going to be the mid episode card so it ends on 120. As for the slow pacing, you showed a high word count in 118. This makes me think they're going to add filler to the dialogue scenes in 118. As for other places for filler, the recent trailer showed the shards from 120 so maybe the filler will be an extended, trippy montage of all the shards scenes animated? I expect filler in PATHS at the very least."
uunam,berthototototo,"As for your Paths idea, in the trailer for the Mikasa shard at least the camera moved through it but it was the same angle as the manga and didn't seem to be a fully fleshed out scene. Other memories could have filler to them but I feel like if the Mikasa one doesn't then the rest likely don't either."
berthototototo,syntax_girl,"If the filler is the return of the ""Berserk"" Eren, i'm happy with it, lol"
syntax_girl,Jay040707,That was one of the things I wanted for the final battle. Eren's berserk titan just bursting out of his skull after the 137 explosion.
syntax_girl,Potential-Gap-4733,samemee
berthototototo,gotbaned_thisismyalt,"Wow‚Ä¶ just wow. I‚Äôve been working on a very lengthy script for AoT that I‚Äôm very passionate about, and I know how time consuming it is to piece together all my thoughts and back it up with evidence. You‚Äôve gone the extra mile and actually constructed graphs while still fully explaining not only every (Paolo) leak, but every data point. You have my full respect, honestly.

And as for whether I agree with the content in this post or not: I most definitely have had the same concerns you‚Äôve made apparent, so it was nice to be validated with a really well-worded post.

 I would like to ask you one thing though: do you think this ‚Äúfiller‚Äù might not be filler at all? For example, we know that there‚Äôs going to be some extra foreshadowing for Ymir‚Äôs ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with King Fritz according to Paolo. And for a while, I‚Äôve thought about how necessary it would be for the anime to smooth over the ending‚Äôs flaws with not ‚Äúfiller‚Äù but **completely new and original foreshadowing.** Do you think the reason for the slow (1x) pacing, even within action-based episodes, is only because there will be entirely original buildup for the ending?"
gotbaned_thisismyalt,berthototototo,"Paolo has stressed that the Ymir and Fritz thing isn't something that glorifies or increases her love. It's apparently subtle and shows her ""admiration"".

The surprising thing is about this is that apparently that's the only additional shot to Chapter 122, or at least the only thing he noticed. Perhaps it's because it's more than one cut, and it's more of a scene, so he is giving more emphasis to it. I hope so because there's ample opportunity to add stuff to that chapter, not just in a ""fixing the ending"" sense but also because of the nature of the panels moving across time and not showing many different angles. Simple things like that are natural in an anime adaptation. Either way as long as the Ymir moment is subtle I'm not worried about the content. She just can't blush or make an anime girl noise.

To answer your question, no I don't think the purpose of the filler is to intentionally make plot/character/thematic changes. I think the filler's intent is filler and that the production committee ordered 12 episodes from Mappa. Whatever the continuation is, Part 3 or a movie, probably needs Chapter 132+ so they've had to stop at Chapter 130/131 and because of the 12 episodes need to stretch it out. Besides moving the training flashback to Episode 2 and 3 of the series, S1 and S2 having a slower pacing wasn't about fixing anything.

That being said, Isayama could suggest changes. Everyone know S3P1 as an example, and the small ones in S3P2 (The Gross monologue and the depth perception of the standoff between Erwin and Reiner) but in S4 Isayama also emphasized he wanted the audience's closeness to the Marley characters to be as similar to the Paradis characters as possible. I don't think this was really followed to its fullest given how rushed Marley arc was (And since they ended with Ch116 instead of Ch122 like I said in the post, I've since felt that the reason Marley arc was rushed was an issue seen with Marley arc, as the pacing gets much better later on), however the anime added a few additional character interactions in Episode 2. I think we'll for sure get some stuff like this, but the anime team will have to come up with their own filler as well.

I just can't imagine Isayama coming up with enough fixes to drag out the season like this. People have their issues with Chapter 126 and think there could have been more talking between the Alliance before the final battle, and there's the Ymir stuff of course, but other than that I haven't seen people say we need additional scenes in literally every chapter from Ch117 onwards. It's the Shiganshina battle especially that makes me feel like this is more of a reverse engineered decision rather than being for the sake of the story. I would like if this was Isayama working closely with the anime team but even if he was, at the end of the day he doesn't write the scripts. He merely gives suggestions and I don't think they're structuring the entire season around that.

Thank you for the compliments to this post, by the way. It's good to see likeminded people when it comes to this level of detail for the adaptation. Also I hope my response wasn't too long.

EDIT -- Something I just thought of. Aside from what the additional scenes are, the way we'll be able to tell if this is just for filler is if there's really long recaps like there were in S2."
berthototototo,gotbaned_thisismyalt,"Appreciate the response. You make solid points for the filler most likely being nothing too important, and although I am a bit worried about the potentially sluggish pacing, with episode 1 being only a week away, it might be best just to experience it as it comes out (and also look for longer recaps like you pointed out)."
berthototototo,GuardOfTheDawn,Y'all would do anything except just wait lmao
GuardOfTheDawn,berthototototo,This is addressed in the post but thanks for your opinion.
berthototototo,JadeDotWu,"The filler and switches from the manga are intended to fix the issues. I don't think it's going to actually change the ending.


In my head the first episode will cover Mikasa's flashback after the Rumbling. It gets moved to the front to do a couple of things: reinforce the fact that Mikasa is important, remind the audience what's happening, and build to the battle. From there everything is played MOSTLY straight with a more additions- like Falco dream sequences when he becomes a Titan, and Zeke's Titanization Scream getting more of a focus.


The remaining 'filler' will be used to address plot-holes further down the line. There's gonna be more bullshit with the Alliance, like Annie and Levi talking. It's possible the Connie thing gets deleted or reworked altogether. If it stays in then we'll probably get extra short story sequences of other characters... like Historia. I think Connie also won't nab Falco until the Titan threat is MOSTLY finished. He's such an ass in the manga. The Titans are devouring people around him and he fuckin' BOOKS it with Falco. It's super out of character.


But mark my words I THINK there will be an entire Mikasa filler episode. Gods help us. It'll probably have something to do with ""I can sense where Eren is- like he's calling to me"", and some more explanation about the Azumabito, like tying that symbol Mikasa has to something about sacrifice or some bullshit Ymir/Fritz allegory."
JadeDotWu,berthototototo,"I don't think they'll change the ending. I don't think I touched upon the idea of AOE anywhere in the post.

Personally I disagree with the idea that the filler is because they are specifically motivated to fix the issues. What's more likely is 12 episodes were ordered along with whatever format is going to adapt the remainder of the anime. The filler is more of a result of not having much to work with in my opinion. It's just extremely out of the blue to think that some of these chapters went by too fast, except for the cliche of people saying only Chapter 126 was rushed. But that's only one episode compared to the many that will be slowed down.

There's been leaks from other sources about Episode 1 that say it just covers Ch117-118. No Ch115, and no Ch123. They could very well be fake but Paolo has also not included Episode 1 when wondering where ""that moment"" (Which I've taken to mean Ch123) will go. Also the flashback itself is important but so is the transition to Mikasa's POV to the present and I can't see that working if we're still in Ch117."

jazzimus_prime,Holdthefart,"Yeah, I agree with you.

But I must say that it will kill me to finish S4P1 in chapter 116, because chapters 117-122 are my favourite chapters ever.

The waiting it is going to kill me :)"
Holdthefart,jazzimus_prime,"yea, i understand you, but we have to sacrifice our desires for the greater objective good"
jazzimus_prime,Holdthefart,"Of course! I am willing to wait as much as needed, if at the end we get a nice adaptation.

I want AOT to be the BEST anime in history!"
jazzimus_prime,rubbie,"(The Marley Arc is the only one that has been canonically named tbh, all others are fan named)

Agreed with all the rest of your points"
rubbie,jazzimus_prime,"Yea, that point was just to counteract the statements made which said that ending on ch116 will be bad because an ""ARC"" wont be complete."
rubbie,Erigu,">(The Marley Arc is the only one that has been canonically named tbh, all others are fan named)

The official guidebooks came up with arc names, but I guess that depends on whether or not you consider them ""canonical"", of course."
jazzimus_prime,edller,"If they cliff hanger the Eren vs Reiner round 4 shit will be funny, imagine anime onlies getting hype on reiner  just for them to see another beat down. Idk why people underestimating eren i hate it when they dirty my boi!"
edller,TheOriginaIAlphaMale,"At this point I see Eren vs Reiner as another Levi vs Zeke. Its always super hype to see those characters clash, but you clearly know who's gonna win lol."
TheOriginaIAlphaMale,edller,"Levi vs zeke is okay for me but i didn't get the excitement on watching them fight maybe bcuz the SC got wiped out just for levi & levi always **FAILED** to kill zeke. 

Sorry levi fans but i know the truth hurts he always failed & zeke let himself be killed on 137 with open arms."
jazzimus_prime,bronx_the_tronk,"Not very surprised ngl, the chapters leading to the battle in Shiganshina are very dialogue and plot heavy. I just hope they do Zeke's backstory justice"
bronx_the_tronk,jazzimus_prime,"Same, Zeke's backstory is one of the sole reasons I wanted a ch 116 ending, I don't want it to get the Reiner treatment."
jazzimus_prime,arnav1311,"Something else we haven't considered. With the pacing as is rn, we may get many new anime only scenes, with some potentially from Isayama himself. I would love to see some new scenes."
arnav1311,jazzimus_prime,Yes

This arrangement seems to work well, though, ahah, I won't complain"
jazzimus_prime,Arby81,"Not a fan of this personally. I get it needed to be done for logistic reasons. I wouldn‚Äôt care too much if we were going to immediately jump into part 2, but there‚Äôs definitely going to be a wait. 

Paths chapters being the climax of the story it would have been ideal to head into a break after those chapters. I think ending prematurely loses some momentum that this arc was building up to and having paths be in the middle of the 2nd part takes some emphasis off those chapters. 

Also, despite being officially labeled as one arc, WfP and the rumbling have such a huge shift in narrative that Ch. 122 ends up being a natural transition in the story."
Arby81,jazzimus_prime,"Logistic reasons aside, if you wanted to fit path chapters into the remaining 6 episodes, that would completely destroy the pacing."
jazzimus_prime,jojoismyreligion,Imagine if they edited the ending of episode 16 like they did with the last episode of season 3 part 1 show a small and horrifying glimpse of what's to come.
jojoismyreligion,jazzimus_prime,"Yes, that was one of my points, they could show flashes from ch122 and the coordinate (since its featured prominently in the ED anyways)"
jojoismyreligion,DanTan3machi,That would be a huge spoiler and not a teaser.
jazzimus_prime,TurbTheCurb,Let‚Äôs not pretend that chapter 116 is a good season finale. It‚Äôs understandable due to production issues though and means they wont have to animate another fight
TurbTheCurb,jazzimus_prime,"""season finale"" don't always have to be a big brawl though, it's perfectly fine ending at 116 imo"
jazzimus_prime,hisham2003,I really want another glitch ending
jazzimus_prime,yukinowins,"> Also, they might do what WIT did in season 3 part 1 in the end credits of the final episode and show us some scene or a glitch like effect but that is just speculation.

I wonder if they did a teaser like that what exactly they could show. The serumbowl teaser worked because even if you paid close attention, you couldn‚Äôt tell who was burned (at least for me cause I was anime only at that point). If they showed Zeke or Eren in paths it‚Äôd imply they died or something, if they showed the Titan in the walls it‚Äôd be kinda obvious the Rumbling gets started. I‚Äôm thinking maybe Ymir running through the forest before she gets in contact with the thing that starts it all but cutting before she actually touches it (forgot how to spell it)"
yukinowins,jazzimus_prime,Tbf I could figure out the body was Armin because - He wasnt present from the trio and Eren and Mikasa were bawling their eyes out (I  was anime only at that point too)
yukinowins,Dpoolio,If they do have a post credits tease it could definitely be eren in chains looking up at paths
jazzimus_prime,TheActualRealNopeInc,"I am 100% okay with them ending part 1 here. As much as I love what Mappa's been doing it's no secret that they've been in production hell and as much as I hate to say it, it shows. Them having that little more time to work on the best part of the story is going to be good for everyone."
TheActualRealNopeInc,jazzimus_prime,"Agreed 100%
It's actually surprising that some scenes are looking as good as they do, if you are aware about how the show is produced"
jazzimus_prime,cookiboos,Isn't it worse production wise if they get the same schedule for 117-139 ?
cookiboos,jazzimus_prime,they won't get the same schedule because they wont be rushed by kodansha now (since the manga would already be over)
jazzimus_prime,Pranal30,I just hope it doesn't get TPN S2 treatment.
jazzimus_prime,MrKrebZoid,A movie of 117-122/123 would be perfect the peak of the show in the absolute best quality. This is also incredibly biased I have no idea how people would react to that but I‚Äôd be pogged out of my mind.
HollowLoch,shipmaster1995,Thank god I love in Asia where it was released months ago. I really don't understand how they are going to release season 2 this year while the majority of fans outside of Japan and a select few other countries have not seen a crucial arc
HollowLoch,MrKrebZoid,That has more to do with COVID and by 2022 I‚Äôm sure things will be better enough to release movies.

jazzimus_prime,asura1958,"Hold up this doesn‚Äôt make sense. The AOT Final Season included Ymirs backstory, I thought it would go up to 122. So why did they include Ymir falling into a giant tree in the trailer?"

Puccifromheaven,Cakukil,"i really dont think its the end, eren didnt know the future until season 3 part 2 so younger eren learning about the rumbling would be a huge retcon"

The months of waiting after 123 for Rumbling content, and instead we got Connie and his thing, Annie and her bullshit, Armin being a numb cunt, Mikasa barking, and the Yaegerists having an actual point while being portrayed as the bad guys.

And all the while we were wondering why the main character had...disappeared. Then he came back briefly, and disappeared all the way to the final chapter."
ChadKingFloch,rafaxd_xd,"Naming this shit ""the final season"" since 2020 is so fucking wrong..."

irl-shinji,ChadKingFloch,"A reliable leaker has confirmed that it will end at 130, also the episode titles already released and the  last one called Dawn of humanity and will most likely adapt the 123 flashback+130."
ChadKingFloch,Redditpaslan,can you share the leak üëâüëà
ChadKingFloch,willy_glove,"My theory is that it will be 131 flashback + 123 flashback, showing from both Eren + Mikasa‚Äôs perspectives. Then it will end with 130‚Äôs rumbling scene. The movie will open with Ramzi + hange‚Äôs deaths."
ChadKingFloch,Raghav_Singhania,"considering there is no aoe,they did the right thing(not that i like it) cause 131 will be good opening for the movie

still who knows maybe we get an announement like demon slayer that duration of last episode will be increased"

I had a couple moments this season, but the last two episodes I haven‚Äôt even watched. And the same will be for the movie, if there is one. I am not watching that, I‚Äôll have to pirate it or some shit"
Raghav_Singhania,wylertyler,"131 is the climax of erens character, and the entire series for me personally, it feels weird to start the movie with a climax when it just goes downhill from there. 131 would‚Äôve been a perfect final episode imo"
ChadKingFloch,ILoveLaughin,"ngl when I found out, it kind of made me want to stop watching. Like that's all I really wanted tbh, it was even referenced in the opening..."
ChadKingFloch,CuteReaperUwU,"Idk man, I like that it will end on 130 since that might make a lot of anime-onlies feel what we have felt for months, thinking that the Historia's baby sub-plot would be important than BAMMM! The movie comes out and it was Mikasa all along!"
ChadKingFloch,ProfessorDipshit_3,Can someone explain to me how the pacing it gonna work? We have 3 episodes left and chapter 128-130+123 left to adapt. There is not chapter 128+129 would take more than a episode since its mostly action sequences. But then how're they gonna stretch out 123+130 across 2 episodes? I can imagine 123 taking up the duration of an entire episode but 130 is pretty short. I cant imagine chapter 131 not getting animated with this pacing. If I were to guess they would animate the latter part of 131. It starts with the scene when Armin goes into paths and proceeds to animate the AruAnnie convo and ends on Erens sleeping head. Then part 3/the movie has a perfect beggining with the start of chapter 131.

For the most part i dont mind it but I actually dont want this to be explicitly explained or show up in 139 (well maybe a little easter egg/tease again should be enough). I kinda just want it to be like a directors cut of sorts, like a special version if you look hard enough into this, including using the fake previews and this drama cd.

theeshyguy,TheOfficialGilgamesh,">spouts the nihilistic ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù that humans just suck and there‚Äôs nothing your idiotic futile little slave self can do about it, and not even the universal concepts of karma or causality will stop the evil from flourishing.

Great post and this is what I agree with the most. This defeatist message of ""bro humanity is bad so never bother to change broooo"" is such a wannabe deep message. 

I also want to add how creatively bankrupt the ending in general is. In Breaking Bad for example, Walter was never excused by people around him at the end or was treated as an ""uwu tragic misunderstood little lamb"" like Eren was in the ending. He was hated by his family, had to come clear what his true motivations were and then died alone and broken in the only place he had ever found any true joy in. 

If you want to show that your main character does something irredeemable, then don't fucking shy away from calling him out. Better Call Saul for example in the recent episode, makes no attempt at trying to portray Jimmy as tragic and misunderstood for what he did in the episode. Is he sympathetic? Yes, absolutely. But he's still to blame for what he does. 

This also should've applied to Eren, but no, I guess because of muh determinism and Ymir knows, he wasn't at fault, he was just BoRn ThIs WaY."
TheOfficialGilgamesh,theeshyguy,"I barely touched on it in this post, but it‚Äôs so fucking weird how all of these feel like some personal exonerations from the responsibilities of one‚Äôs actions. Shit like ‚Äúhumanity is just always bad, we‚Äôll always fight‚Äù or ‚ÄúI was born this way‚Äù or ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs a slave to something‚Äù all feel like the copes of some terrible egotistical psychopath that never put in any effort into just *being a decent person*. They‚Äôre fuckin toxic excuses arguing against self-betterment in the names of futility and nihilism. No one can ever be held responsible for their actions for some reason or another, because that‚Äôs a heavy topic and too much of a burden to put onto the *teenage target audience* üòí"
theeshyguy,TheOfficialGilgamesh,"Yeah it's the most defeatist postmodern bullshit philosophy that exists. Don't ever attempt to change because you can't help it, you're just baaaaaad."
theeshyguy,cpu9,"Eren was never a villain. The rumbling was the morally correct choice. The story could not possibly make it more clear, because the validity of this choice was probably the main reason that Isayama even began writing the manga to begin with. But then he felt bad about it right at the end, and tried to clumsily pretend he had written something fundamentally different than what he had, despite obviously not even knowing how."
cpu9,theeshyguy,"Honestly I partially agree, which is kinda a problem in its own right. Isayama set up this conflict and stacked up all these reasons why the outside world *should* be rumbled, and then tried to turn and sell us this ‚ÄúEren did it because he wanted to‚Äù bullshit, and *so many people* just *disagreed* with that canon reasoning.

It falls back on Yams‚Äô nihilistic misanthropy; we can‚Äôt root for ‚Äúthe moralistic saviors of the world‚Äù because the world they‚Äôre idiotically defending is irredeemably awful. All the countries are like fuckin Warhammer factions, starting genocidal wars on whims, treating wars like they‚Äôre personal, and holding on to grudges for centuries. In Devilman, we feel bad for humanity because it‚Äôs a clear triumph of their hatred over their compassion, both of which were shown in great detail, but in AoT, humanity just never even has a ‚Äúgood side‚Äù that we would want to see preserved through the crisis.

Mfer justified global extinction and then tried to turn and criminalize the characters for seeing it *the way he made it*. Committing global mass murder *should* make a character unambiguously a villain, but he designed a trolley situation that makes people think ‚Äúmaybe not,‚Äù which seems to have muddied *his own* intentions with the framing of his story. It‚Äôs so stupid and weird.

Like, it he wanted Eren to do it *for himself* then we didn‚Äôt need all the reasons he listed. An Eren that disregards all reason for the rumbling beyond ‚ÄúI want to do it‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt become Hobo Eren or wait for the declaration of war, and the world wouldn‚Äôt need to unify in a genocidal war against Paradise, but for some reason, Isayama made all of those things happen anyway."
theeshyguy,cpu9,">but for some reason, Isayama made all of those things happen anyway.

It's because he clearly intended the story in part to be a condemnation of the defeatism and pacifism which characterizes the culture of modern Japan, but then he started to feel bad about the Naughty Opinions he had held a decade earlier and the allegorical implications of a more straightforward ending where Eren simply destroys the world for reasons stated. In retrospect, chapter 121 may have been intended partially as a metafictional cry for help. A middle aged man, who once held righteous hatred that could destroy the world, breaks down and can't kill one family, even while they call for the death of his own. Then the spectre of a 19 year old, almost exactly the age Isayama was when he started writing the manga, leans down, and demands he finish the job. Saying, literally, ""you started this story, didn't you?"". A shame that he ultimately succumbed to cowardly compassion. He was denied his legacy, and we were denied art."
cpu9,JP93XZ,"This. This explains the ending. Isayama probably would've stuck to this ending if AOT had not blown-up in popularity and it was just some obscure manga. Vindicating genocide would've ruined his now international reputation and career, way worse than what we got in the end, in my opinion. Not condoning nor condemning the author's artistic expressions (want to stay out of that discussion), but I believe this is what he originally had in mind."
JP93XZ,cpu9,"I don't think it was a reputational thing, I think he genuinely had a crisis of concious. Chapter 121 in particular makes me think so, it might as well be a conversation between his present self and who he was when he started the manga."
theeshyguy,CROWEDOME,"This is honestly a great comparison really because EDs think of ‚Äúedgy Eren‚Äù as cringey and dark. And they believe that the ‚Äúreal Eren‚Äù is really good because he did some Lelouch bullshit. Eren winning and killing his friends and the world would be considered edgy, but in a way, it wouldn‚Äôt an actual victory.

Eren would pretty much be in grief after committing those atrocities, his desire for freedom led to the deaths of those cared about. While Paradis would be free from the hatred (if they don‚Äôt destroy themselves tho), Eren would seriously hate himself for what he‚Äôs done. If we put in the EreHisu ship in this theoretical ending, while his child would be the first child to be free from hatred, Eren would never enjoy that sort of freedom for the rest of his life. His guilt would be forever with him."
CROWEDOME,WrathAndRancor,"""edgy eren"" as opposed to real erentm who killed billions simply because their existence was disappointing to him and he didn't see them in his fucking book

eds (not all just enough) cannot be reasoned with"
WrathAndRancor,TheOfficialGilgamesh,"That's what I don't get. 

How is the canon Eren aka the maniac who killed 80 percent of humanity because of a fucking book he read as a child better than the chad Eren who wants to save his people? 

Seriously, 131-139 Eren makes no fucking sense. Imagine if in the future some guy becomes president and then kickstarts WW3 because he saw an apocalypse movie as a child and wanted to recreate it. 

Even COD villains have better motives than that."
CROWEDOME,TheLeechKing466,We can also throw in that due to the rumbling destroying the ecosystem he would have managed to free his people but at the cost of the world he wanted the freedom to see in the first place.
CROWEDOME,Gacel_,"Eren winning and Paradis just killing between themselves though internal conflict anyway (with Eren begin alive to see it through it all) would have been a great ending.

Bonus points if Eren could stop it but after seeing that he killed his friends and the outside world for nothing he just stops caring and let it happens."

It's fascinating to me though, how Crybaby managed to get me emotionally attached to it's characters in just 10 episodes, yet in AoT I couldn't connect with most of the characters on the alliance that have been a part of the story for over a decade.

I agree with you on how should have AoT ended, a horrific AnR ending in which no one shows any kind of sympathy for Eren. I want to see one of the cringevengers perhaps Jean survive the rumbling and then shove Mikasa's bloody scarf into Eren's face and ask him about the cost of freedom. I want to see Historia treat Eren like a complete stranger when he gets back to Paradis. I want to see someone calling him a murderer from a middle of a crowd. I want to see the scared look on little Ymir's face when she sees Eren after she learns about what happened. To post it simply, I want to see his suffering and this is the main reason that I seriously didn't like AoTNR's part 2 because it seems that Hisu is willing to spread his legs for him from the moment he gets back and she will happily start a family with a man who committed the worst crime in human history. I don't care if this happens in AoE or a fanfic, I want it to exist."

Why would a paradisian do that? Isnt he their saviour? Saving them from the outside world ? Most people arent educated either?

Why would she do that? She is with him.

>Jean survive the rumbling and then shove Mikasa's bloody scarf into Eren's face and ask him about the cost of freedom. 

What cost of freedom?"
Capital-Worker898,-thechosen-1,">Why would a paradisian do that? Isnt he their saviour? Saving them from the outside world ? Most people arent educated either?

In chapter 125, we learned that some people died when Eren unleashed the titans of the walls, you may call those losses collateral damage but whatever you name it his action leads to the death of some Paradisian. On top of that, it's fair to assume that a good portion of island pacifists aren't on board with full rumbling.

&#x200B;

>Why would she do that? She is with him.

As she said ""I won't be able to live with myself if I don't do anything to stop you"" and Eren replied, ""Then I can alter your memories"". That's just a bluff, the Eren we know would never take the freedom of others who didn't try to take his. So I think it's reasonable if she doesn't want to live with the devil who committed the worst crime in history. Besides, Historia is now a mother and has to care for her child. I strongly believe that accepting Eren as Ymir's father will destroy her life sooner or later because a day will come and Ymir will find the truth about what happened.

&#x200B;

>What cost of freedom?

I think none of the Cringevenges were against partial rumbling, from their perspective Paradis would be safe after that for decades but they didn't approve of genocide. So for Eren, the cost of freedom is taking the life of everyone outside Paradis plus the loss of the woman who always put him before anything."
theeshyguy,Anonymus_Thoughts,"Damn, good read, but I just spoiled myself. Either way, I'll give it a look. Thanks for the post."
uchihacoltro,three_firstnames,"Phew, this is a relief. I‚Äôm much more optimistic about the pacing of the remaining episodes now! And while it‚Äôll be a bummer to have to wait longer to see 120-122 get adapted, I‚Äôm happy waiting if it means they will be given the justice they deserve. Also, this pacing means that there‚Äôll likely be more time for Zeke‚Äôs backstory, which is great!

Also, assuming there will be a 12-13 episode Final Season Part 2, then ending at 116 would nicely parallel the end of the first part of Season 3: the SC riding to Shiganshina to do battle with Reiner/Bertolt vs Reiner and co. flying into Shiganshina to take on Eren."
three_firstnames,GioMike,">116 would nicely parallel the end of the first part of Season 3: the SC riding to Shiganshina to do battle with Reiner/Bertolt vs Reiner and co. flying into Shiganshina to take on Eren.

I like this"
uchihacoltro,Khazu_,Yeah 122/3 is totally out of question now. The two possibilites now are 116 or 119. I still think its more likely 119 but we are being surprised (and for to be honest positively). It means they will cut almost nothing now and it feels so good. Now they question is... If they are ending on 116 will they do a movie for 117-123 and than 2nd part (Still would prefer just TV series)?  If on 119 than just 2nd part?
Khazu_,Abysswatcherbel,"They probably are going to do a part 2 and not movies, doing movies would take too long

Unless they enter into a joint venture with Production Ig, not even that, since they are in the committee 

Production Ig did something similar with the Fgo Camelot movies, they animated one and their subsidiary Signal Md animated the other to deliver them close to each other"
Khazu_,alisonburgersm8,"Although I don't mind a movie, I don't see any chance of them doing it now that we are definitely ending at 116 or 119. Way too much content left to be adapted into 2 movies let alone 1."
uchihacoltro,PrasantGrg,Would love 116 end. But this would make me question why did they cram Reiner backstory so hard considering they could've made the action move quicker later.
PrasantGrg,Kag5n,The only reason for me would be to go more rapidly at the part when we see Eren and the crew again.
uchihacoltro,Medeses,"Most definitely ending on 116.
Which is very strange. 
Why didnt they just make 17 episodes then to get to 119? A 17th episode would theoretically just come out a few days before the end of the manga.

I could potentially see them doing a movie for 117-123 and then maybe a regular season afterwards which could actually be really sick.

Or just another 12-16 episode season for the rest.

117-139 is probably too much content for two movies, so I think it‚Äòs relatively likely that we will get another season"
Medeses,Abysswatcherbel,"17 episodes would enter the spring season, that's not how Japanese TV works

And kingdom will take the aot time slot"
Abysswatcherbel,Medeses,"Yeah, I know that‚Äòs how it usually works but this season started really late in the fall season and I think S3P2 also started like 3-4 weeks into the spring season back then.

I know it pointless to discuss that because we know we are getting 16 episodes. 

I just think 116 is a really weird ending spot.

Episodes 9-16 are pretty much all slow build-up episodes (aside from a few moments like Levi Vs monke or Zeke‚Äòs backstory) and then the season ends right before the payoff"
Medeses,alisonburgersm8,"Imo 116 is a much better place to end this part than 119, for both story and production reasons. 

Story reasons because 119's cliffhanger as amazing as it is would really be a troll for anime-onlies. And it wouldn't really have much suspense because everyone knows Eren would survive, similar to that Jon Snow situation in GoT. 

Production reasons because they would have more time in part 2 to polish the fights between 116-119. We all know how much they are already struggling with their schedule even when CG was used in most fights in the Marley Arc."
alisonburgersm8,Medeses,"Production wise I agree but story wise I kinda dislike 116 as an ending. Episodes 9-16 are all going to be build up episodes and then the seasons going to end right before the climax.

Funny that you mentioned GoT because thats similar to how A dance with dragons ends right before we get the climax to any of the three main arcs (North, Mereen and kings landing).

In the end it doesnt really matter because we will definitely get S4P2 within two years max where as we have been waiting for The winds of winter for almost ten years, I just think ending in the middle of an arc is pretty weird. (119 is also not a really good ending point but atleast then there would be a battle at the end of the season)"
uchihacoltro,Matt_37,"This is mega weird tbh, I wasn't expecting this..."
uchihacoltro,k2k0k1k3," honestly i'm ok with 116 end
I don't think 119 will be a good cliffhanger tbh"
k2k0k1k3,TrueHeirOfChingis,I think the opposite
uchihacoltro,ReadyForKenny,"Part 2 or (dear god no) movies will be announced soon i guess. Although 16 eps for 116-139 still doesn‚Äôt feel enough, I‚Äôll trust Mappa on this"
uchihacoltro,ZrishaAdams,"Imo 119 is only possible now if we get a double-length final episode. Also, it may be an unpopular opinion, but I think 119 is better season cliffhanger than 116 (plz don't kill me)"
ZrishaAdams,NameIsAlreadyInUse,"119 works as a episode cliffhanger,but would be awful as a season cliffhanger. The only way it could work was if they atleast showed Eren entering paths and meeting Zeke during a post-credits scene or something."
NameIsAlreadyInUse,ZrishaAdams,"I agree, but I would still stand by the fact that it is a better season cliffhanger than 116. 116 cliffhanger is just to create hype for next episode; wouldn't work well enough for a whole season imo.

Plus, people shit on 119 cliffhanger due to how undermined it gets after immediate chapters. Yes, it might feel cheap later, but it is a great cliffhanger nonetheless. Many people have compared it to GoT S5 cliffhanger, which worked really well Afair."
NameIsAlreadyInUse,emailo1,I'd say a mid ending scene (like s3 p1) whit eren and zeke on paths
uchihacoltro,DialedWrongNumber,Production committee man.. why even cut into this arc if we don't reach the payoff chapters. This is like getting into Uprising and ending the season before they attempt to rescue Eren. Really weird place to end at 116.
uchihacoltro,neverknowsless,"i‚Äôm not mad at it ngl. i would‚Äôve loved a longer season but i‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre taking their time w/ it.

i‚Äôm really interested to see if they‚Äôre going to go a movie route then part 2 or just straight to part 2. i guess it‚Äôs possible they could do another 16 episodes for 117-139 since there‚Äôs a lot of action in the chapters, but that still feels like they would have to rush through a lot. having a movie for 117-123 then adapting 124-139 sounds more feasible in 16 episodes imo but we‚Äôll see!!!"
uchihacoltro,Mysterious-Tutor-942,"At the very least, this means they won‚Äôt rush through WfP"
uchihacoltro,alisonburgersm8,I've said it weeks ago that we'll end part 1 at 116 and I got downvoted for that. Imo a much better place to end this part than at 119 because as much as I love that cliffhanger it would be too cheap.
alisonburgersm8,Unavailable_Seaweed,"Yeah, the 119 is a bit of a cheap cliffhanger for a season finale, but it could work with a post-credit scene, for example Eren waking up in Paths with very little to no dialogue, couldn't it ?"
Unavailable_Seaweed,alisonburgersm8,"That‚Äôs what I hoped for too if we were really ending at 119. They could tease Ymir in paths too, and maybe that could trick people into thinking Eren‚Äôs dead and ended up in heaven or something. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna work because obviously Eren can‚Äôt be dead (yet), which still takes away the suspense."
uchihacoltro,wilzix12,"Pls not a movie, we will have to wait like a whole year to watch it, and i love the discussions after the episodes"
uchihacoltro,kobriks,This will make the pacing for the remaining episodes a slog. Why exactly did they rush Marley arc then?
uchihacoltro,Vecus,"I think the whole gabi arc could easily be condensed into one episode or less, that should save some time"
TrueHeirOfChingis,emailo1,Yeah whit a post credit scene showing eren and zeke (and maybe ymir) on paths it would work well
uchihacoltro,MaulVader2,"I remember seeing a post a while back (can't seem to find it) saying that the season would probably end at 115 and giving their reasons why (Zeke's mini-arc completed, Yeagerist rebellion set up, etc) and, even though I didn't think much of it at the time, with these new titles revealed I think it might be very plausible. And honestly, I think that's a good thing. Yes, I want to see the paths chapters animated as much as everyone does, but WfP is a very dialogue-heavy arc, and a slower pace is perfect for it."
uchihacoltro,Cersei505,"its 100% ending on 116. With this pacing, its impossible for them to adapt 6 chapters in 2 episodes( 15 and 16) to reach 119.

At best, expect then to cut when eren and reiner transform midway through 117."
uchihacoltro,Cephardrome,"Well fuck xD, that means if theres another season we're starting off with a Banger"
uchihacoltro,Cephardrome,"This is gonna be the weirdest Ending Ever if its 116, not only does it amount to nothing it also ruins the Build up we've gotten."
uchihacoltro,alphonse_Lric,It's weird though because in the trailer were also shown the Paths scenes like Eren in front of the coordinate and glimpses of Ymir's flashbacks
alphonse_Lric,uchihacoltro,Maybe a teaser/corrupted ending like s3?
uchihacoltro,alphonse_Lric,"At this point probably, difficult to get to 122 at this pace"
alphonse_Lric,Abysswatcherbel,"Man why people are still talking about that trailer, it has nothing to do with the production and this season 

It was all a Alpha presentation that would be completely scrapped later"
Abysswatcherbel,alphonse_Lric,"Chill man, I was just pointing that out not saying that they should have absolutely done it"
alphonse_Lric,Khazu_,I mean this is trailer for final season. The whole thing. Part 1 can end much before that. Trailer was only preanimated.
Khazu_,usayd2009,They either changed plans or they didn't include last arc in the trailer because that's a big fucking spoiler people would easily get it.
alphonse_Lric,TrueHeirOfChingis,Ignore the trailer its worthless when it comes to speculation
uchihacoltro,Sasuke082594,It will end on 119.
uchihacoltro,TurbTheCurb,"Ah that‚Äôs disappointing. I would have understood the cgi if this final season included the Marley counterattack, but that means Mappa only had to animate 2 battles with titans and it still looked like that. And, even disregarding the animation, means this war for paradis arc which is already not that interesting until near the end soaks up all the screen time. So I guess reiners backstory died for nothing then cause paradis = cool but Marley = wack üòé"
uchihacoltro,JuicyDragonCat,"I could see them ending even sooner than 116, maybe even with the ymir reveal at 115 honestly"
uchihacoltro,GioMike,Final Season Part 2. Let's fucking go!
uchihacoltro,DimashiroYuuki,"Strange. I was so sure they would call episode 13 ""Ignorance"". Oh well."
uchihacoltro,deathkillerx3004,"That probably means ending the season on 116, and continuing with anime part 2, since there's way too much content for a movie."
uchihacoltro,greenice31,I think the squeeze is possible to end on Eren getting quickscoped because a huge chunk of that is just action.
uchihacoltro,cookiboos,"Hold up, is there a chance this is season 1 all over again ?. There was 1 week break after trost arc and then the female arc started. If they don't cut anything maybe it's indeed ending at 116 so they can squeeze 10 more ep untill 122-123. 

I fear that a part 2 with all these chapters left will be even worse for them if they don't get at least 1 year for it. 

A movie from 117 untill the end will have cuts since there's no way it's gonna go past 2 hours.

Best case scenario would have been to end on 122-123 and give them a year for the rumbling arc, but oh well."
cookiboos,ericg012,and rush all the way to get 123? How is that the best case scenario?
ericg012,cookiboos,"I meant to say that they should have had more episodes, like the usual 24 so they could adapt untill 122 or 123. I'm just hoping they get more time for part 2 cause besides the whole rumbling they will also need to animate the wfp fight, and overall the whole part 2 is like 80% titans on screen. If the production comitee gives them the same schedule, then they're gonna struggle."

GidgetSpinner,FazzahR,"Sheesh, great work! This connects a lot of stuff I've been making note of, your image for the time travel was very helpful as well.

Has there been any mention of how it looks as if baby/young Eren can see himself? In ch120 Eren sees his family together and has some sort of look. From here it sort of made it seem that baby Eren is reacting to seeing an older version of himself, or maybe Zeke --[https://imgur.com/a/giRiBja](https://imgur.com/a/giRiBja)"
FazzahR,GidgetSpinner,Not sure how that would work since Eren can only see future memories and he didn't even have the Attack Titan at that point.
GidgetSpinner,FazzahR,"Eren can see much more than just future memories, he can see past ones as well from previous Attack titans. That's how he learned about the Owl and everything in Grisha's life. Once we learned of powers that exist outside of time, we could consider that ever since Ymir came into contact with the spine that a part of her, the Attack Titan part (whatever it is), already knew of Eren and everything to come. 

I had a  similar thought -- that he didn't have the Attack/Founding titan yet so why would he have any power like that at all? But ever since the first chapter/episode something has been different about Eren. He had a 'dream' of things that would eventually happen. Eventually he exists outside of time, so it wouldn't really matter *when* he received the powers. In one sense he's always had them. This is what I thought of when he says, ""Ever since I was born, I've been me"" in ch121."
GidgetSpinner,len_slibinas,"Hello, I really  liked your analysis. While I  wasn't initially onboard with Eren basically killing his own mother, it does make sense of some things.

I have read up through Chapter 138 and am up to date on the anime, so there might be  spoilers though my focus will be on an earlier section.  

With little time left I'm not sure if this will be resolved but it is still interesting to think about. First, despite my trying not to get too attached to anyone, Bertholdt became  my favorite  character, second  my favorite part is basically just before Utgard Castle up to Ymir, Bertholdt and Reiner recovering on the wall.   

Anyway, I always thought it strange how Bertholdt answers Eren's question when he asked him what Bertholdt was thinking when he told him how his mother died. Bertholdt gives him a long look and then replies,  ""At the time, I felt sorry for you."" (some translations  have  him say ""Back then""  or  ""In the moment"").  The specific way he phrases it  seems to imply that he  actually did feel bad for him at the time, but something changed since then and that is no longer the case.  Tied with the memory shard theory  it  could mean that Bertholdt has seen something, possibly that even Eren hasn't at that time and that is basically Eren took part in his mother's death.

While I'm not sure how Bertholdt would know this, it seems different titans have different abilities on the paths. I think possibly  the bearer of the Colossal is at times aware of  the guilt or sins in the past, present, and even future.  However the bearer is also burdened with the inability to do anything about them, and that the combination of the two weighs down on them. I thought maybe Bertholdt became aware of  what Eren did just before his transformation on the wall. In the anime version at least, he and Eren seem to have a moment where they are just staring into each other's eyes before it cuts to Reiner.  In the manga, it's a little different since it goes Bertholdt, Reiner, and then Eren.

I  don't think Eren really knew what Bertholdt was saying until he touched Dina's titan and then became aware of his own guilt in the matter and as he mourns Hannes he is also crying at what he has done.

I  also wonder if  maybe Armin had seen this in Bertholdt's memories.  He  seems to  be lying to  Eren when Eren asks him if he saw something in those memories and he says nothing significant.  Initially it just seemed that his crush on Annie has him basically spying on her in those moments,  but if he had seen either  Dina aka the smiling titan walking away from Bertholdt at the gate or he had seen what Bertholdt had  seen in Eren back then he might be  hesitant to share  this  information. 

Reiner also says that  of all the people to have the coordinate, that Eren is by far the worst. I don't know if that is a personal judgement  of character by him or if this is something the armored titan can figure out along the paths.  Fun note, the name Reiner means judgement warrior or deciding warrior,

Anyway, usually when Bertholdt says something odd it tends to make some sense later and the way he said, ""At the time, I  felt sorry for you,"" is a bit strange and I thought maybe there would be more of a resolution to it."

GidgetSpinner,Proxy_of_Death,">I think we can all agree that the scenery is related to the rumbling, my personal bets are on this picture from 131 and all the blood and gore surrounding. Hence Grisha's description of ghastly

The panel after that was a disappointed Eren so I assumed that won't be scenery.

>Eren used the power of the Founding and Attack Titan to manipulate the smiling titan in the past to go on the course of events that would lead her to eat Carla, to motivate Eren to kill all that titans, and eat Hannes, to allow for Eren to figure out about the coordinate.

Isn't during the Rumbling that he asks what his mother will think of all this? Will someone with such a connection to his mother instigate her death at the same time?"
Proxy_of_Death,GidgetSpinner,"1. I meant the ""freedom"" panel

2. Would someone who cares about human life go along with the rumbling and kill 100s of millions of innocents? As well as attack his friends? If it means the freedom of him and his country then yes."
GidgetSpinner,Proxy_of_Death,">1. I meant the ""freedom"" panel

Exactly tge panel that follows after in the same chapter showed Eren as disappointed so I doubt it is the scenery that he was happy about.



>2. Would someone who cares about human life go along with the rumbling and kill 100s of millions of innocents? As well as attack his friends? If it means the freedom of him and his country then yes.

Eren cares more about his family, friends and country more than others in that order. Didn't he sacrifice himself to save Armin? Even willing to fight Levi and SC for Armin. He also stated he would gladly give his life if it meant changing this cycle of hatred and saving Historia. Eren is not only motivated by his desire for freedom. 

Wasn't Eren who suggested that other ways are found to save Paradis before Rumbling is ever considered?

I don't think Eren has attacked his friends, even Armin confirms this in 135. With the founder's power he can end all of them if he wanted to considering they are all Eldians. Maybe he is guilty of not protecting them."

Conqueringrule,Conqueringrule,"I just realized I completely forgot to fill in the 4th citation, apologies, I'll try to do that soon (edited to say WIP like the other few currently being worked on). That's easily one of the biggest ones I'd have to do, so it may take a bit of time.

Also, would it make more sense to call them footnotes? They're kind of an inbetween, given sometimes they genuinely are just citations to other posts/videos, but other times they're explanations given from myself. Might edit the post to change it to that if that fits better.

**Edit: While filling in the Historia footnote, I accidently put together two words that I assume the automod did not like (think the word ""yourself"" following the word for intentionally sacrificing yourself that ends in death). I'm gonna see if getting the post undeleted is possible, but if not, I'll reupload the post but with that part reworded.**

Conqueringrule,C4923,Great post. I'd say pre-timeskip has a lot of mistakes. All of that influenced how badly the story ended.

NorthernSkagosi,noobjaish,It's so peak ü•≤
Conqueringrule,llckme,it all came down to theatrics. with the cringevengers formed isayama couldn‚Äôt care bout story but rather show off cool and sick moments.
llckme,Conqueringrule,"Definitely, theatrics is a great way to put it.

Really, when you break down everything that happened with the Alliance, it does feel as if they're simply acting or pretending to be heroes, like they're putting on a show of being good-guys more so than actually caring about stopping The Rumbling. They don't think long or hard about anything that matters (see their absolutely nonsensical plan to try to stop the Rumbling for example), they (primarily Armin) don't learn from their repeated mistakes, and they don't actually make any hard choices.

Take Hange's death for example. We're supposed to believe they genuinely care about stopping The Rumbling, being ""good-guy heroes"" just a product of that. Yet nobody cares at all when Hange, someone drastically more important than Connie or Jean for stopping The Rumbling, chooses to be the one to sacrifice themselves. They all just respect it, because it's not actually about The Rumbling, it's about looking good and being ""nice"".

Annie choosing not to go with them was even worse, unbelievably detrimental to their cause. All I need to do is let ""smart"" Armin speak for me: ""I'm glad... Annie... should just keep on being Annie."" They sacrifice nothing, make no hard choices, act only through emotion rather than logic, all to play pretend hero as Isayama bends and forces the world into allowing them to win. In other words, all theatrics."
Conqueringrule,tonormicrophone1,hey for some reason the mods removed your post.
Conqueringrule,noobjaish,üêê post OP. Keep up the good work mate.
Conqueringrule,NationalSea9072,"Ending defender here. I disagree with most of these and I would like to explain why. Hear me out at least, because I don't want my time spent writing this to be wasted.
First, Mikasa returning with Eren's head is, I agree, somewhat of an issue. It's not necessarily impossible, as Fort Salta is relatively close to the African coast. Any boats there should be available, and Mikasa would have the ability to commandeer one. I do think Isayama didn't fully consider how it would be possible though.
Second, Saying that the final battle has absurd plot armor is completely missing the point of it. Eren only went through with the rumbling because he thought it would be what's best to protect his friends. He does care for the island of Paradis, but they are an afterthought compared to his core friend group. As he states on the train scene, he cares for them more than anyone in the world. He even refuses to allow any of them to inherit his titan, even if it would be best for someone familiar with Eren to inherit it. 
Of course, he does make sacrifices to get further. Hange dies, which he expresses guilt for, but he is never as close to her as the rest.
If he killed any of his close friends in the rumbling, what would be the point of it? He would be alone in the trampled world. If you wanted a mist-type ending, that's a matter of personal opinion. It was not Isayama's intention and wouldn't have worked in the story as it was written.
Onto the main points:
1. We don't know if it is Jean. That's on purpose, it's supposed to be up to interpretation.
2. Falco is unique. As far as we know, no other pure made by Zeke's spinal fluid has eaten a shifter. Annie has consumed some part of each shifter (perhaps their spinal fluid), but that's different than an initial transformation entirely from the beast. It is convenient for the plot, but I see no reason to think it's completely impossible. Marley was still actively researching titan shifting because of how much they didn't know. Applying arbitrary rules based on what little the reader has seen is not a reason to assume a plot hole. 
Falco probably flies about 2300 miles based on the location of the Azumabito base and Fort Salta. While that's a large distance for a normal titan, birds can travel much further than any other animal. Some can travel 7,000 miles without stopping. Considering that he was flying along the trade winds, it's completely possible.
He's not particularly powerful in any way, either. He would be terrible at attacking other Titans because they could grab and pin him to the ground. His wings would be atrocious in physical combat. He is used as, and is good as, a moving base. He does not outpace Zeke in combat in any way.
At the very least, Falco's titan wasn't a last-minute addition. It is probably the most foreshadowed titan in the series. 
3. Assigning limits to time travel is stupid because time travel destroys a timeline no matter what. Everything in the AOT universe is a bootstrap paradox, and the Dina twist doesn't change that. Also, her promise never made sense. For being so focused on how everything in the ending should logically happen, it doesn't make sense to care about Dina's promise. Even if she does have a special connection to Grisha to seek him out, Eren isn't Grisha. We see no evidence that Eldians genetically share space in paths - which would have to be the case for Dina to find Eren when seeking Grisha. Dina finding Eren consistently is a ""convenience"" for the plot, but it creates an extraordinarily poignant situation during Scream and Carla's death, which helps create the most important moments of the story. It's not like coincidences don't happen in real-life either.
4. Ymir's connection with Mikasa is completely logical. Her impossible romance to Eren mirrors Ymir's impossible romance with Fritz. Whether or not you like Ymir's secret love, her connection with Mikasa is objectively real. Eren's death at the hands of Mikasa is what defines the ending, and that's also what defines Ymir's reason for moving on. It's not like it makes Eren unimportant, because he's still half of the romantic situation. His entire life was leading to that moment, too, even if he wasn't the one to take the final action. This has also been a theme of the story, hammered upon in Bystander.
5. Ackermann memory manipulation is (as far as we know) due to a deal between the royal family and the Ackermann house. While the Royal family is prohibited from manipulating their memories, we don't have evidence to suggest the same limit applies to Ymir - it seems more likely that she is all powerful over her subjects.
The Azumabito/Mikasa plotline is not pointless. It provides the Azumabito with another motivation to come to Paradis. It isn't capitalized on because of the rumbling, but it does matter.
6. We have no reason to think that Frieda would be good in combat. She was young, and she probably never trained. She did use harmless memory manipulation, but that's completely different than fighting. Did you forget about the vow renouncing war?
I don't think there really is major plot armor in the port battle. The main cast are by far the best and most experienced warriors on the planet fighting mostly recruits. On top of that, nearly half of them are shifters.
7. This one is definitely a problem. While it's possible Isayama had reasoning, I think it's just as likely that it was an oversight. That said, it doesn't really matter. The rumbling stopping doesn't have much impact on the rest of the fight.
8. Saying without doubt that Kruger would support the rumbling is illogical. We know barely anything about Kruger or his background. What we do know is scattered. He is a hardcore patriot, but he's also human. There's little reason to think he would want to commit genocide against all nations (because Marely is a small piece of the global rumbling).
10. This whole post about Armin is terrible for numerous reasons. Armin retains his intelligence. He is largely responsible for the enormously successful raid on Liberio. His plan to nuke the founding titan is also decent considering how much they didn't know. What else could he have come up with given their situation?
11. There is no reason to think that Wall titans are just giant pure titans. That's completely illogical. If they were, it would've started moving immediately to attack Mikasa when it saw her. Obviously, they're completely subservient titans who will only move when commanded. Coving them from sunlight would make sense from Nick's perspective too. Nick doesn't know everything about the titans, but he would likely know that they need sunlight. It is logical for him to be worried about the sun waking them up, even if it realistically wouldn't. Covering them also stops the titans from being seen, which Nick wants anyway.
13. There was no Historia character assassination - she just settled down. That's normal human behavior.
14. Assuming that the wall titan reveal invalidates the entire alliance plan makes no sense. The plan was fine and there was literally no other option for them.
15. The founding titan has absolute power. That effectively invalidates all specific other abilities, but it doesn't make the Warhammer useless. The Warhammer's ability is the only reason Eren can break out of prison without being crushed. It is needed for the ending to happen.
16. Eren and Mikasa's relationship (or lack thereof) is one of Isayama's admitted regrets. He regrets them not kissing at Scream and having a more obvious relationship. I agree as well that it should've been shown better. That's not to say it was a retcon though, as we know it was planned since then. It is definitely foreshadowed in Marley, when he asks her ""what am I to you"", and it is foreshadowed when he asks Zeke about it, and they have a conversation about their relationship.
Comparing it to Casca and Griffith is also pointless because they are different series. Isayama compares Mikasa's direct attributes to Casca, not her relationships.
That's all I have time to write about for now. I could come back and finish the rest later, but I don't think it would be very well received"
NationalSea9072,Conqueringrule,"Thanks for taking the time to write this all out, especially in good-faith. All of these things I considered either when making this iceburg, or when making a few of the posts up above. I'll edit the footnotes to address a few of these. Edit: have to cut down on this a bit, I think, not letting my post the reply. I'll try sending it in two replies and see if that works.

Mikasa traveled across an entire barren, destroyed continent, starting off in what appears to be a badlands desert, to then swim across an ocean, with nothing except a decapitated head. There is no amount of suspension of disbelief any rational person can have for this. The Ancient Titans were, supposedly, from Ymir, not Eren, so that argument is null. But even if it were Eren who did that, it still wouldn't be true! We see them clearly harm the Alliance extremely badly, Levi gets his legs destroyed and Connie nearly falls into the abyss below, so they're clearly trying to kill them. The battle was just like the Port scene, but exponentially worse in every way; we're supposed to take it seriously, as if it's an actual conflict, but the writing just isn't good at all. And in addition to that, as late as Ch. 130 Eren was still intended to kill (much of) the Alliance, or at the very least whenever Chapter 130 was written that was the case. That topic requires it's own post to show, but it's pretty conclusive. That really doesn't matter, though, considering the titans weren't even from him.

1. Well we don't know it's Mikasa. If it's not directly confirmed, how do we know who anyone visiting his graves are? Well I'll tell you; just through thinking rationally. We see a woman who looks just like Mikasa, wearing a scarf just like Mikasa's, with a child that looks like it belongs to her, with a man who looks identical to Jean, identical stature, identical hair color and hairstyle, and would obviously make sense considering Jean had the crush on her the entire series. In other words, there's only evidence to suggest it is Jean, nothing to suggest it isn't. If you're going to assume it isn't him, why assume that woman is Mikasa? Otherwise you're just cherrypicking when and when not to be rational about things.
2. I believe the cited post addressed that all, but a quick TLDR if not would be that it destroys the entire concept behind the just revealed (or more accurately, just confirmed) Female Titan power, and as explained later on, destroys the established worldbuilding. Flying is easier than walking/running, sure, but as the map showed, in that image, Falco flew about a third of the png, while the distance the average shifter can run before running out of steam is... a single pixel. I also want to go back to the point about plot convenience; this isn't just some minor bit of convenience, like happens occasionally in AOT, this is absurdity unlike really anything else in the series. Also, the rules weren't barely explained or arbitrary; there was a very clear separation of powers between the shifters, and a ton of worldbuilding specifically about how they'd done all the testing possible with the Beast Titan, nothing that suggested anything like this would be possible.
3. You should check out the post, it goes in-detail on this. A bootstrap paradox is one thing, characters being forced to perform completely arbitrary actions for no reason is something else. The post covers basically all of that.
4. I'll address that when I either find sources for the footnote or write it all out myself. Big one to tackle.
5. Ackermann memory manipulation was a ""product of titan science"", but that difference doesn't matter. Ymir can alter memories, sure, but it's pretty heavily implied Eren was the one who set up the Cabin dream. And on that note, it's kind of a ridiculous concept for there to be a specific character who's double immune to a power (Ackermann, created literally for immunity to the power, and Azumabito, not even Eldian), never use that deliberate trait, and then... have them have the power used on them anyways.

And for the Azumabito plotline, yeah, you're correct that it was used for that. What Isayama used it for was an easy reason for the Azumabito to both trust Paradis and for Paradis to trust them. But that's all he used it for; it was revealed and then went nowhere, when this should've been something important to Mikasa's character in really any way possible; but instead it didn't matter for Mikasa at all. Isayama even gave up having Kiyomi have any kind of relationship with Mikasa, given she ended up having more personal and real of a conversation with Annie than she ever did with her."
Conqueringrule,Conqueringrule,"  
6. Should've mentioned in the footnotes to see replies to comments on my video discussing that. I'll copy-paste what I replied to people making that point here:   
  
""We already saw what Founders bound by King Fritz's vow were capable of doing, 9:58 touched upon one of the things - that she was clearly shown being able to erase the memories of Eldians with ease, meaning she knew how to order Ymir to do stuff, and could have easily erased Grisha's memory. In addition to that, we know that generations of kings, up until Uri, hunted Ackermanns down to extinction due to them not being able to have their memory wiped, so they are absolutely able to use violence and their powers to take out enemies. The existence of the crystal cave, as well as the iceburst stone, means the Founder, even after the vow, was completely capable of using hardening to make crazy things.""  
  
In other words, since it was revealed in the 120's that using the Founder is just ordering Ymir to do stuff, ""lack of experience"" doesn't make any sense there since she could do all that.  


8. See pinned comment on that video, 3/4ths of it are just about Kruger, but at the very end of it is an ultra summarized TLDR.  


9. Here's the quick comeback I use for this. After Liberio, as well as before Liberio but after timeskip (flashback era), Armin doesn't do or think of anything that Connie couldn't have. That might sound like an exaggeration, but there's genuinely nothing. There's actually plenty of smart things he could've thought of, or even very obvious things he could've thought of, especially with the final battle (see Alliance Plan post for that), but since he lost his intelligence, Isayama had to essentially just hand him every one of ""his"" victories; the video cited there and my comment on it, you might have to scroll down a bit to see it, cover that.

10 (you mean 11). See section of video, or even better, the cited post. Wall Titans were established as being conscious, that was the point of covering them up, so they don't wake up and break out. This goes a lot deeper than you might first realize, there was a lot establishing and proving this, and a lot destroyed by it being retconned.

11 (you mean 13). Planning to find, and if that's not possible, make a detailed post about this. Basically every choice Historia made in S4 contradicted what she learned in S3. Her being forced to bear a child to sacrifice? Really, how different is that from her being forced to eat Eren and continue the cycle of sacrifice there? Are they not functionally the same scene?

12. Ok I'm not sure which one this is referring to, but by the context of what you're saying, I assume you didn't read the entirety of the Alliance Plan post, if that's what you're referring to. There's a *lot* wrong with the Alliance's plan, there's a reason why it's probably the single-worst scene in AOT, much more past that one issue.

13. Eren could've just, you know, been let out by the Jeagerists, who had either just taken over or were in the process of doing so. Him using the Warhammer there was really just for dramatic effect. Even if it were a justified use of the Warhammer, that would still be an incredible letdown considering how much significance was placed on him getting the ability.

14. Read the cited post there, I believe Part 2 directly addresses that. I'm pretty sure it wasn't him who said that, instead being a staff member/editor, but that was actually a lie, and that's not just a presumption based on that not making any sense; Isayama had said so. See post for what I'm talking about."
NationalSea9072,KingDennis2,"How does that make sense? We are supposed to think the battle is believable, no battle prior to this on such a large scale was so successful. You say Eren does this for his friends but this isn't the case, this goes against what he says in 139 and what he says to Ramzi. If he cared as much as you say sacrifices like hange are completely uneeded as he could have slowed the ct's to buy time. Eren even admits he's not sure they would survive. 

It's poor writing to have the final and biggest battle with the world on the line to actually have no stakes. The alliance looks like they are on the edge but actually never are because they clearly won't be killed or seriously injured."
NationalSea9072,KingDennis2,"You don't find that poor writing? Arguably one of the biggest, most developed, and important characters in season 3 just settles down and is put to the side lines. Not a single character does that and the excuse of it being ""just human"" doesn't really work when no one else has done it. 

Historia fits more in season 4 than really any other season as well, she's Queen. Her being sidelined hurts the story and doesn't make much sense"
KingDennis2,NationalSea9072,"Honestly, there isn't much she could do. She has been a figurehead since she was put into government, and she does spend her time raising kids who were in a similar situation to her, which I think works well as a character conclusion. I can see why you'd want her more involved, but her uninvolvement is a big part of the overarching story, considering that Eren partially goes through with the rumbling to end the royal family being sacrificial sheep for the power of the titans.  
Whether or not there are many scenes with her in them, she is undoubtedly still a very large part of the story."
NationalSea9072,seohbackwards,"the assassination with historia is that we're led to believe she got pregnant with a dude in order to save herself. her child was born because historia didnt want to die/turn into a titan. this literally runs right along with kenny telling historia ""you were born out of someone else's misery"". it is an assassination to make her literally follow what kenny says and not have a child out of actual love like her character SHOULD do"
Conqueringrule,KingDennis2,"I don't really get the Warhammer complaint. It's not really ever rendered useless as it was built up because it is incredibly powerful, and it would be very advantageous for Eren to take it from Marley. And the WH helped Eren multiple times within the final battle before he becomes the founder. And like yeah you can say the Yeagerists could have freed him but I don't see how this is a negative, it adds more to the story the way it happened.

Edit: I don't know if you're using the anime but it's alot more polished then the manga and I feel like thag would be a better thing to go off of"
KingDennis2,Conqueringrule,"The Warhammer complaint is definitely one of the more minor ones, I agree with that. Sure, we do see it used briefly in the battle in Shiganshina, but it kind of just... didn't really matter there? He used the one aspect of the power that wasn't very interesting, spikes, very briefly, and they didn't even really work. Going over the whole scene, he spawns spikes, Porco slices them immediately, he spawns spikes again and actually impales Reiner and Porco (this is the only time he uses them successfully), both shifters get themselves off pretty quick, he tries to get Porco with spikes again and fails, then Reiner impales Eren with his own spike and Zeke shows up.

I'll try to reword my point about the jail scene. I'm glad he used the Warhammer there, I defnitely agree that it's cooler than him just being let out by Jeagerists. The point I was trying to make is that it isn't a genuine reason for him getting the power, it was really just for hairbun Eren aura."

Second one, not nearly as much as the others, but I do think it's emblematic of the ending overall. It's such an obvious oversight and so ridiculous in concept, something that's never happened at any other point in the series, that it really goes to show that clearly *something* was going wrong behind the scenes with the ending for that to happen.

Third one, you should check the footnote for what I meant by that. Don't think we're thinking of the same thing.

Don't think I ever mentioned Reiner.

Well, guess we agree on one thing, haha.

Some things are left open-ended, Zeke and Armin escaping paths for example, and those things are either not included in the iceburg or identified with the purple outline as being more debatable."
Conqueringrule,MichaelAftonXFireWal,"Some of these ""Issues"" don't matter and are a waste of time complaining about."
MichaelAftonXFireWal,Conqueringrule,"They definitely do range in significance, but I don't think any outright ""don't matter"" - I'd argue they all do matter, albeit some not very much. My goal was to make this be comprehensive anyways."
Conqueringrule,MichaelAftonXFireWal,I really don't think we should worry about how Mikasa got back to the island.

We found out in her OVA, that she can create and remember alternate timelines without anybody's help... It was the same thing happening in 138. she was remembering a past timeline she had created..."
Nearby_Ad_6701,Successful_Priority,Speaking of their relationship I think people exaggerate how long they were siblings I think it was around a year or so until the beginning attack. Point being the criticism of ‚Äúeww their siblings‚Äù doesn‚Äôt hold much water
Nearby_Ad_6701,No-Necessary-7585,"Okay, I‚Äôm not trying to make a twisted reason here, but you do have somewhat of a point. okay let's talk about the scarf wrapping. Well he may have done it for freedom, but he did it for her freedom, he didnt have to introduce himself if he did it for just her freedom, he could have killed them and ran, but he introduced himself to her, which showed he cared about how she felt, wrapping the scarf around her was showing somewhat of affection? Am I wrong, maybe? okay the whole punching Dina mess, I think your pretty much right on that, however, it was through Eren‚Äôs POV, and you can see how Mikasa looked so much different, isayama confirmed that eren saw mikasa beautiful in his eyes, (lmk if you want the proof) does that mean love? No. but it had some meaning. Another thing is Mikasa had every right to see things through the lense of her child hood, she couldn‚Äôt see the future, she just wanted to listen to Carla as she felt obligated to protect eren, I feel like she was so more then such a low life that she is depicted as, I feel as if she were an average human placed in an unaverge life self. If that makes sense? Okay now when he told hee that he hated her, why would eren say he didn‚Äôt want Mikasa to be with anyone else if he didn‚Äôt have feelings for her?! if he hated he since they were kids, wouldn‚Äôt he not care?! What was the point if he just wanted her to be free?! Why would he want mikasa to love him after he died if he wanted her freedom?! Wouldn‚Äôt he want her to forget about him for freedom? Please tell me if my thinking is wrong, but I hope this make sense, somewhat."
No-Necessary-7585,Nearby_Ad_6701,"I never said that Eren and Mikasa dont share a significant relationship (At least within the first 3 seasons). They obviously do. I never said they do not care about each other. They obviously do.

My post is highlighting that in no way do they share a romantic relationship, therefore his actions in 139 make 0 sense.

Of course Eren has affection for her. But its not romantic affection. Its familial affection. He cares for her as a sister, as a role model, as someone hes known for years. Him treating her kindly and caring of her does not represent romantic affection, especially considering how scarce it is the manga. i.e. It literallly only occurs when theyre in a life or death situation. A life or death situation should not be required for Eren do demonstrate the level of affection that signifies a romantic relationship, let alone that scnene in 139.

&#x200B;

\*""\****Another thing is Mikasa had every right to see things through the lense of her child hood""***

Shes immature. She cannot reconcile the way in which Eren has changed, because she herself has not changed. Therefore, compounded with the fact that Eren does not demonstrate romantic affection, a relationship betweent he two wouldnt even be healthy. It has nothing to do with knowing the future and instead to do with acknowledging her present.

How can someone who spends more time thinking about her own desires than the death of everyone shes ever known possibly maintain that kind of relationship?

&#x200B;

\*""\****why would eren say he didn‚Äôt want Mikasa to be with anyone else if he didn‚Äôt have feelings for her?!""***

It was established that he was lying here and this was an attempt to drive her away. This however was later retconned in 139 where we learn he knew that theyd try to stop him and succeed in doing so,

consequently, Eren told Mikasa that he hated her for 0 reason whatsoever.

&#x200B;

***""Why would he want mikasa to love him after he died if he wanted her freedom?!""***

A man, has said that he dosnt want this woman to be happy, live safely, or love anyone at all for the next 10 years at least **AFTER** he has died, because **HE** dosnt want her to move on,

and you think, this man ""loves"" this woman?"
Conqueringrule,Ok_Celebration9304,"My eyes hurt from focusing too hard so I only read up to the point of Reiner and Eren's parallels. You bring up lots of good points,¬† though. I personally was sort of put off by the Reiner and Eren rivalry and how s4 turned to be Eren doing what Reiner did to him for revenge. It's not a bad idea but I feel like there are better contenders to act as the ""villains"" and enemies of Eren after the reveal about the outside world. The people who are in higher positions and more in control, who controlled and sent Reiner there in the first place. Like the Tyburs who could've been expanded on more. But I understand the logic of why it was written this way to flip the narrative on Reiner and stuff. It's just feels weird and wrong that the enemy was Reiner all along or something and Eren wants to take his revenge starting with him. Something's missing but I can't put my finger on it.


Also, I really agree about the church in s2. They hyped me up to the reveals about the walls and secrets of the titans, then faded into irrelevancy. They could've played a big role in s4 with their knowledge about the rumbling and the wall titans, maybe even helped the alliance or something and gave them clues on how to stop or prevent it all together or something. Wasted potential. And when Zeke was killed the titans just stood there instead of acting up due to sunlight like the pastors said they would. So much world building and foreshadowing thrown out the window.¬†"
Conqueringrule,Illustrious-Fan5927,what plan? they never had any plan all they came up with was to jump on Eren's skeleton body and find Zeke. And these guys don't even think they don't come up with doubts like: hmmm? isn't odd how Eren is making this all a bit too easy? or it's bizarre how Eren completely leaves himself wide open for any attack.
Illustrious-Fan5927,Jumbernaut,"Yeah, Eren could have just rolled over, The End. the FT's body was helping the alliance more than anything. If Eren had just become a head + spinal cord inside a crystal and made one of the Colossals carry him, the alliance would probably have had a harder time, and that's just one idea.


The whole final battle felt fake, with no stakes. It should have been impossible for the scouts to win, but they do so without a single death.


In Batman, the Dark Knight (2008), they do this properly.¬† Instead of a ""superhero save the world"" scenario, it's about two ships, one choosing to blow the other and the Joker. The stakes are smaller, the scale is smaller, but the tension feels real.


More important than the fact the scouts had no real plan is the problem the author created for himself when he made Eren's FT so godly powerful. If the author really intend for Armin and the scouts to find a way to defeat Eren, she should have made him defeatable.


I can accept the scouts going after Eren with no plan, willing to do anything they can to try to stop him, ready to die, since they were partially responsible for Eren getting the FT's power.


Killing wasn't a great plan, but since the Rymbling was already happening and they didn't have many other choices, there as a chance that doing so would stop the Rumbling. If it didn't work, it would just be a wreck on a wreck.


What really bothers me is when they kill the yeagerists in their way when they don't have any concrete plan at all."
Jumbernaut,Illustrious-Fan5927,well said
Illustrious-Fan5927,Conqueringrule,"Don't worry, I call that out too. But here's the thing; even that miniscule outline of plan Armin came up with is awful, completely illogical and can be definitively proven as such. There's so much wrong here that it layers and layers itself into plotholes on plotholes on plotholes by the finale, it's very strange and unlike anything I've seen before. Even as early as 133 we can see the whole plot starting to fall apart, people were just too starstruck by what Isayama had accomplished earlier to realize that was what was happening until the very end."
Conqueringrule,Fast-Awareness-4570,"LMAO what plan? They didn‚Äôt have a fucking plan (didn‚Äôt read this, but it looks fire, I‚Äôll read it later and comment again)"
Conqueringrule,im_nob0dy,"Off-topic: But it always annoyed me how MAPPA bungled that iconic shot of Eren as Reiner is about to eat him. In the manga, we see a cold, steely look of unwavering defiance from Eren as he refuses to surrender. In the anime, it's just some bland side angle, with half of Eren's face obscured."
Conqueringrule,Ididntwannacreateit,"I'll add you another reason why this plan is bullshit. Beginning of volume 13 (cut from the anime) Armin notes that even after Dina died, Eren could still controll the mindless titan: thus the royal blood worked for a few more minutes (or hours since the other titans didn't follow them). The bright Armin should have remembered this detail and be cautious about Zeke's death because it would either lead to Colossals going rouge or nothing since Eren should still have the power.

Obviously we know from 122 that Eren obtained full power and Zeke is no longer necessary. I guess he dragged him along to kill him later and that the original plan was to kill all the other shifters as well and reunite the powers into one. Which would explain his distance towards Armin and their friends in the latest years and why Falco (a JAW titan) could be able to fly. He wanted them to come so he could kill them all, but then retcon happened and he lost all his will."
Conqueringrule,StorageCorrect3005,After all why don‚Äôt Eren just take their ability.  The whole plot is stupid so just don‚Äôt put too much time and effort into it
Conqueringrule,MichaelAftonXFireWal,"Plan was simple


Kill Zeke, stop Rumbling cause Eren NEEDS a Titan of Royal Blood to do the Rumbling


Did every ending hater forget that part that was painfully obvious it was practically spoon fed to us


You are making a question that's very easy to solve more complicated then it needs to be"
MichaelAftonXFireWal,Ok_Celebration9304,"Zeke literally lost control over Ymir, she gave her powers to Eren and Zeke became useless. Eren only engulfed him to prevent him from joining the alliance or something. Killing Zeke in fact shouldn't stop the rumbling when Eren literally broke the royal blood vow and rendered Zeke useless. Yet, it stopped when Zeke was killed because Isayama forgor."
MichaelAftonXFireWal,Conqueringrule,"You definitely didn't read the post lmao. I touch on a lot more than that. But the thing is, even *that* doesn't make sense - or at least it didn't until Isayama retconned the beginning of Season 2 out of the story."
Conqueringrule,MichaelAftonXFireWal,What are you talking about retcon the beginning of Season 2?
Reasonable_Carob2534,digbick_42069,Nah I wholeheartedly agree with you. I also wished there was much more of Eren's perspective throughout the final season.
digbick_42069,Fallofmen10,Yah it was kind of a whiplash. First 3 seasons he was your typical shonen type beat with a bit more bloodlust. Cool character but not the best. Post time skip Eren is so engaging and interesting on so many levels. I get why his perspective was basically cut off.... but man did I miss it. He was the best part of all of s4
Fallofmen10,Krawlin91,"Part of the intrigue is the mystery, he is almost a completely different character and it is apparent from the get go, if we knew what he knew not only would it spoil the rest of the story (he literally knew everything that was going to happen) it would just make his character depressing AF"
digbick_42069,Reasonable_Carob2534,"Thank you for responding :) I think limiting the amount of his mindset we see creates a lot of intrigue and really makes us feel as lost as the other characters do when it comes to Eren, but still I would get on my knees for some Eren POV crumbs."
digbick_42069,Rasnall,But Eren died when Gabby removed his head. That's why there was nothing else from his POV until the very end. Also to have his POV during the invasion ark would have just given the story away
Rasnall,digbick_42069,You do realize Season 4 didn't start with Eren getting decapitated right?? I'm talking about all the way back to the 1st episode of season 4.
digbick_42069,brogrammer1992,"As much as I hate the ‚Äútwist‚Äù, I agree with you.

Some simple character development with his power ups showcasing how power just takes away more of us freedom post Return would have been great.

It was a clear theme up to then:
1.Threatened by the garrison.
2. Imprisoned 
3. Subordinate to Levi.
4. Babysat until he is kidnapped.
5. Literally at Historias mercy.

Hell it starts before he gets his titan powers.

Instead, he gets nearly unlimited forsight, immense power, and apparently bootstrap paradox‚Äôs his way into genocide.

We get his constipated face after kissing historia, and he actively fucks with the timeline.

They don‚Äôt earn his mental breakdown.

His time as founder we could‚Äôve seen him seeing every other future where is loved ones die.

Something."
brogrammer1992,ErenMert21,Wait what twist? Also there was not really time to explore  his psyche and no reason too. We alr had 131 for that

Icaro04,Reasonable_Carob2534,"i meant more in a show, don‚Äôt tell way."
Reasonable_Carob2534,wagshockey,"I think the convo with Armin was for in case anyone missed that Eren‚Äôs (villainous) mindset while self loathing is also extremely selfish, we saw there was a timeline where he runs away with Mikasa, but he chose the rumbling. Yes war continued as is in that timeline, but it also in the rumbling timeline. Eren throughout S4 and the final seasons exhibits is convincing himself the rumbling is for the greater good, it‚Äôs not Eren wanted a sandbox of a world to play in and took it personally when that wasn‚Äôt the case and blamed the world because it made him so it deserves him. Hilariously kinda close to Batman‚Äôs quote ‚ÄúI am the hero Gotham deserves‚Äù it‚Äôs just Eren is no hero."
Icaro04,someloserontheground,Literally just writing dialogue explaining everything is awful writing and not satisfying for the viewer in any way
someloserontheground,Icaro04,"Totally true, but some people need the exact transcription in words of what the character want"
someloserontheground,Lesterberne,Can you give an example of that in the final chapter? Cauz i felt a lot of it was more show don‚Äôt tell
Reasonable_Carob2534,YoManWTFIsThisShit,"I think his character post-time-skip is subtly sprinkled throughout the first three seasons. Take for example his motivation to save Mikasa and Armin was revealed when Eren Kruger asked Grisha that if he wanted to save Mikasa and Armin, which Grisha didn‚Äôt know who they were, and Eren asking himself who‚Äôs memories he‚Äôs seeing."
Reasonable_Carob2534,One_Somewhere_4112,This was one of the main complaints while the series ongoing monthly updates until the end of
One_Somewhere_4112,brogrammer1992,"Yep, it‚Äôs why so much coping occurred until the end, we couldn‚Äôt see inside his gead"
One_Somewhere_4112,Reasonable_Carob2534,That‚Äôs interesting! I‚Äôve only recently gotten into this fandom so I‚Äôm not too familiar.
Reasonable_Carob2534,YardOk5005,"I always saw Eren‚Äôs change as him trying ‚Äòsomething new‚Äô since it follows a theory I love that Eren‚Äôs future self is constantly manipulating his past self via how the Attack Titan inheritors can receive memories from the future as well as the past. 

This is linked to the first chapter in the manga and the anime (I think it‚Äôs been a long while) where Eren talks to Mikasa about the future, like her hair being short. 

So theory goes that Eren is trying to find a ‚Äòperfect‚Äô timeline where everything goes according to plan and the people he loves gets a happy ending. Ofc, it‚Äôs not perfect perfect, since Sasha dies and he was expecting it but I‚Äôd say 8/10 is better than 0/10.

I saw the part where Mikasa and Eren run away as a previous timeline where Eren did what he wanted and I see the current timeline where he starts the rumbling as him sacrificing himself for his friends even though he wants to live with them.

So he does things like guiding the smiling titan to eat his mother in order to keep Berthold alive, and in the same way he forced his own father to kill the royal family in order to steal the Progenitor Titan; he‚Äôs been manipulating the past to get a ‚Äògood ending‚Äô for his friends. 

One where War ends. 

This can also be seen when Eren‚Äôs dad meets the Owl and the Owl says,

‚ÄúIf you want to save them all‚Ä¶ Mikasa, Armin and the others‚Ä¶ Carry out your mission until the end.‚Äù

I always saw this as Eren‚Äôs desires leaking even the past users because he wishes to keep all of them safe. 

I‚Äôd even go as far as to say, Eren was the reason Grisha lead his sister to go outside therefore ensuring he met Diana, Zeke was born and Eren afterwards.

He‚Äôs definitely capable of it since he got the smiling titan to eat his own mother, therefore ensuring Armin became the future Colossal Titan and that his younger self would hate titans: creating the plot we read/watched in order to take revenge. 

As well as forcing his dad to massacre a family. 

So yeah, at least in my head canon, the moment after ‚ÄòThe End‚Äô Eren wakes up underneath that tree on a hill, confused about his dream and ready to repeat the story; albeit with a few changes in order to get that happy ending he‚Äôs been looking for.

Saying that, I‚Äôm definitely a little biased since I really like time stuff like regression (when done right)

Anyways, I saw the post and got reminded of all this so thanks for the blast from the past.

Also it does suck Fr that we barely see Eren in the latter half, granted it makes sense from a narrative standpoint since there‚Äôs supposed to be that whole ‚Äòhe becomes a villain‚Äô thing while his friends try to stop him but as you said it would‚Äôve been nicer to see what Eren was thinking before he straight up told us. 

Felt like his main character status got switched to antagonist for plot reasons.

Edit: should‚Äôve reread through my comment, and sorry for posting an essay I just really like the theory"
YardOk5005,Gabryblynd,"so, if i undertand you. You're saying that, at least in your headcanon, Eren sends messages to his past self so that he may one day achieve an 'happy ending' for him and friends?"
Gabryblynd,YardOk5005,"I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äòsends messages‚Äô more manipulates situations, including those involving his younger self in order to get what he wants out of a situation.

Eg: he ensures Armin becomes the Colossal Titan by keeping Bert alive until X in the story.

It might be cope that he continuously tries again and again but I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs enough evidence, like the beginning where young Eren wakes up from a dream about the future, to say that it‚Äôs possible. 

It would explain a lot of things, like how Eren as a nine- year old child was able to murder 2 full grown adults. 

His future self filled him with hatred for the kidnappers, made him give his speech about ‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt fight, we can‚Äôt win‚Äô to Mikasa which led to them becoming close and her awakening her Ackerman blood. 

Just to say, what I mean by him manipulating is the way he uses both the Founding Titan and the Attack Titan. 

For example, he selectively feeds his father information about the future and practically coheres him into stealing the FT which he later gives to himself. 

He used the speech Kruger gave Grisha in order to reignite his anger.

‚ÄòStand‚Äô ‚ÄòEven if we die‚Äô and ‚ÄòThis is the story you started‚Äô 

This made Grisha remember his lost loved ones, fallen comrades and the oppression the Eldians faced: leading him to following Eren‚Äôs version of the future. 

He uses the FT to guide the Smiling Titan away from Bert so what‚Äôs to say he hasn‚Äôt used it in other instances. 

The tries again and again part is his future self changing his actions. In other words, using the future to change the past. 

As a result the future changes and since X didn‚Äôt happen, Y didn‚Äôt either.

Let‚Äôs say, Eren used his Founding Titan powers to save his mother, instead of the smiling titan eating her, she ate Berthold.

- The Colossal Titan wouldn‚Äôt be available to the Eldians, changing what they can do strategically when fighting against the world 

- Eren‚Äôs mother survives, meaning that Eren wouldn‚Äôt swear endless revenge against the Titans, destroying the plot of AoT

Because he kept Bertholdt alive: his mother died and his younger self swore revenge on the titans, the Eldians eventually got the Colossal Titan as theirs and it was given to Armin then used to fight the world. 

In the next ‚Äòbeginning‚Äô once Eren opens his eyes and awakes from his ‚Äòdream, his future self may change certain actions.

For example, maybe he doesn‚Äôt see memories of his future leading him down the path of nihilism and destruction (The Rumbling).

Of course, this is all a theory but I like it at least. 

Maybe Eren was just born a little crazy, which allowed him to kill.

Maybe his older self didn‚Äôt use his powers beyond what we were shown, where he manipulated Grisha.

Maybe, the beginning about future events was just a ‚Äòfun reference‚Äô Isayama put in. 

Again it might be I‚Äôm huffing copeium but it‚Äôs what I choose to believe because I find it more interesting.

Edit: sorry for making another essay xD

Time travel is really cool to me, a fun video to watch is a short movie called ‚ÄòStalled‚Äô. The time travel in their is done really well"
Reasonable_Carob2534,ItalianStallion9069,I agree
Reasonable_Carob2534,__Raxy__,fr we got 3 seasons with him and his perspective to get nothing for the 4th until the last ep
Reasonable_Carob2534,stronged_cheese,The best way I view how Eren viewed the rumbling is if you watch the first few episodes of AoT right before watching the final chapters
Reasonable_Carob2534,Retrac752,"All I want is one shot of him looking down, and he's walking on the beach and feeling the sand between his toes

Then it cuts to him looking down while stepping on cities and buildings and women and children during the rumbling

He's experiencing all of time at once, so from his perspective this would all be blending together"
Retrac752,Madmandusa,You‚Äôre a genius. You should absolutely write stories
Reasonable_Carob2534,Living-Try-9908,"I feel like the anime covered his perspective in a great creative way with the openings and endings. The Rumbling song is basically giving you his internal thoughts in metal form. It was enough for me. Besides, the audience can conclude what he is thinking from what we already know about the character. Not every part of the story should be spoon fed to us."
Reasonable_Carob2534,monisharif33,"This one singular thing would perfect AOT. I truly believe this is the one reason behind why the fandom is so split when it comes to the ending. Never seeing Eren's POV made people think he had some Light Yagami/Lelouch level plan that would blow all of our minds when revealed. It caused the expectations to be high. We always saw Light Yagami's mental descent into madness but with Eren, we had nothing."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Optimal_Bit_5600,"I'm a bit split on it. On one hand, the fact that we *were* so distant from Eren was what made him so fascinating to watch for most of the final season. He went from a hotheaded but still fairly typical anime protagonist, to this cold hearted and focused terrorist who was making enemies out of everyone around him. He felt like a force of nature and his motivation was probably the biggest mystery of S4. Then when it was revealed that he was out to destroy the entire world for the sake of his loved ones, it made so much so sense and felt like a gut punch.

It was after this point though where I do wish we got more from him. I do get Isayama's desire to focus on the supporting characters and the innocent civilians. The rumbling is a harrowing scenario and getting the POV of everyone impacted by it is crucial. But Eren's time during the final stretch of the story is so goddamn tragic. He basically becomes god with access to knowledge from all of history, having no concept of time or place anymore. There is still that childish part of him that is over the moon because he's finally achieving his dream of exploring a barren landscape, but that fantasy doesn't last forever. He is a depressed and burdened person, knowing he is responsible for so much misery and there is no happy future awaiting him with his friends."
Reasonable_Carob2534,bluedancepants,"Well I mean they do show bits and pieces here and there. Like when he met the boy he was going to crush and when Mikasa told Eren he was family. 

And then the final conversation he had with Armin and Mikasa. 

I think what they showed was enough. And there's enough mystery still left open to a possible sequel. Some have speculated that Eren isn't really dead. Who knows maybe it's all part of his plan."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Jerry98x,"I mean... it is not that we don't have info on his mental state, both before and after obtaining the full powers of the Founding Titan. Tha manga subtly tells you about it the whole time.

Reasonable_Carob2534,Erenjaeger666_,"I agree, it would‚Äôve been amazing to see his pov and feelings during the time skip, I think eren felt that hopelessness and turned himself away from everyone but was also desperate to find a solution to fix everything and also live to be with his friends and when he finally realizes that the outcome will always be the same no matter the thousands of solutions and end with his inevitable death so he‚Äôs like ‚Äúfuck it I‚Äôll just kill everyone at this point‚Äù"
Reasonable_Carob2534,A_LiftedLowRider,"If this type of concept fascinates you as much as it does me, you should read Dune.  Paul has a tremendous amount of similarity to timeskip Eren, especially after the first book.  And unlike AoT, that point of view and the psychology behind knowing such a thing at such a young age, is highly elaborated on.  For me, it really helped me see Eren‚Äôs point of view a lot better."
A_LiftedLowRider,Reasonable_Carob2534,I started it a year ago but dropped it. This comment makes me want to pick it up again though! I‚Äôm really interested in this type of psyche so I‚Äôm gonna go find my copy right now.
Reasonable_Carob2534,A_LiftedLowRider,"You definitely should.  I think you‚Äôll find you have a new appreciation for it and its themes.  The whole of the first book is essentially everything Eren would have felt and thought during the time-skip.  I‚Äôve been describing Eren‚Äôs situation as a ‚ÄúPaul dilemma‚Äù ever since the finale lol.  If you can get to God Emperor of Dune, it‚Äôs essentially Eren as The Founder from his point of view."
A_LiftedLowRider,cursed_melon,"While similar in a lot of cases, it's also very different. 

Personally I am not a fan of the ""I saw the future and couldn't change it"" troupe because it feels like a cop out, but in Eren's case it actually makes sense. He says he couldn't change the future, but that's only because he himself won't change or deviate from his own personal desires. In Paul's case, it is quite different but not in a good way in my opinion."
Reasonable_Carob2534,TruthSeekerHuey,Could have had a separate flashback showing his character before he reveals the truth of his plans to Armin in the last chapter
Reasonable_Carob2534,ErenMert21,Yup but the mystery was so good man. Thats why i also dont get why people wanted places outside of marley and paradies to be explored
Reasonable_Carob2534,KhadaJhIn12,I agree with everything you said exactly how you said it.
Reasonable_Carob2534,endar88,i would have at least been ok with a whole episode before the final episode (if it wasn't split as a movie) being a wrap up almost of the whole show through his eyes with the founding titan. seeing him first person trying to change things/calculate the decisions he made. or whether time was focused to always end this way or not. then the final episode he gets killed and all the post rumbling stuff.
Reasonable_Carob2534,Greek-Ra,Yeah the reason you never saw it is because Isayama obviously didn‚Äôt know how to write it lol.
Greek-Ra,Reasonable_Carob2534,I will always have AO3 at least.
Reasonable_Carob2534,joesica7,"I can appreciate ur opinion, but I have to disagree. I think that one of the most interesting aspects of (for me) watching the final moments of aot was trying to put myself in Eren‚Äôs shoes.

Coming to my own conclusions about his mental state rather than it being explained to me encouraged me to observe the series through a different lens.

Sometimes not showing/explaining something is better than doing so, think the ending of Rosemary‚Äôs Baby (if you‚Äôve seen it)

Just my opinion tho, I can see why someone would want to know the inner working of Eren‚Äôs thoughts now that he was (essentially) omnipotent"
joesica7,Reasonable_Carob2534,"That‚Äôs fair. Thank you for responding! I‚Äôm split because I like that his mental state is hidden because it allows for more discussion and interpretations, but also I‚Äôm so curious, I wanna know!"
Reasonable_Carob2534,joesica7,"Tooooootally feel u in terms of being curious about what‚Äôs going on in his head. Just goes to show how insanely well put together this show is: there is no ‚Äúright‚Äù answer concerning Eren‚Äôs mental state, which is both cool and infuriating lol"
Reasonable_Carob2534,ComfortableReason796,Just search NHK Eren interview
Reasonable_Carob2534,Reasonable_Carob2534,I feel like it could‚Äôve contrasted the Alliance‚Äôs POV really well too. A group of humans POV and then an eldritch abomination with a human‚Äôs mind POV.
Reasonable_Carob2534,ForeverGray,Move forward. Kill them all. More death bring more freedom.
Reasonable_Carob2534,K-J-C,Dunno what do you think of Eren's goals and desires pre-founder if you think he died only because he chose to commit horrible atrocities in time skip?
K-J-C,Reasonable_Carob2534,idk i can only dedicate my head to one aspect of him at a time but what are your thoughts on it? i‚Äôll probably have an answer in a week when i hyperfixate on a different aspect of him.
Reasonable_Carob2534,K-J-C,"I thought his goal, or at least one of it (as Eren has other wants like wanting to end the cycle in time skip), is just similar, Eren wants to experience the outside world he saw on the book. In the time skip, he's disappointed and wants to turn the world like what he saw on the book.

The action is the different one, pre-time skip he slaughters all Titans (his main obstacle to the outside world), in post-time skip he slaughters all living beings outside Paradis. Difference is that he now knows how's the outside world after time skip, thought he just wants to slaughter anything he deems an enemy, just that the target in pre-time skip is a deserving one of pure monsters."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Clean-Eagle-9002,He was the founder at 10 years old
Clean-Eagle-9002,Reasonable_Carob2534,"I meant when he gains the full powers of it during the Paths arc. I could‚Äôve made it more clear, sorry."
Reasonable_Carob2534,bluedancepants,"Well I mean they do show bits and pieces here and there. Like when he met the boy he was going to crush and when Mikasa told Eren he was family. 

And then the final conversation he had with Armin and Mikasa. 

I think what they showed was enough. And there's enough mystery still left open to a possible sequel. Some have speculated that Eren isn't really dead. Who knows maybe it's all part of his plan."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Jurgrady,"I understand the perspective but the thing with this sort of stuff is that it usually isn't as interesting as it sounds. That kind of insight is how you end up with whiney characters that are annoying because we got two seasons of exposition on their feelings.


Way more impactful the way it was. It would change all kinds of stuff as well because a good amount of the plot for what we did get was giving us insight into those things.¬†


It's much better to question wtf he was doing, and then understand at the end, then to know the whole time and just be waiting for the other characters to get it.¬†"
Reasonable_Carob2534,Jengasa,"When you have a very compelling character with an ominous vibe that gives you shivers down your spine every time they're on screen, it's always best to use them in moderation. 
Too much screen time can ruin the magic."
Reasonable_Carob2534,whatsreal45,That would‚Äôve been helpful
Reasonable_Carob2534,someloserontheground,Yeah it was a weird decision to timeskip and then take focus away from Eren to just watch the scouts keep doing the same thing they've been doing all show. They missed a big chance to *actually* shift direction in the show and do something new and interesting
Reasonable_Carob2534,Dry-Introduction-491,"Yah and this is exactly what I expected Final Chapters Pt 2 to address, which they did a little bit, but spent way more time on the romance of two characters whose interactions are closer to siblings than romantic partners 99% of the time."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Annihilator4413,"Idk I found him to be extremely boring after he turned into a maniac. I know part of it was to get his friends to hate him, knowing what he was going to do and being unable to change it for some weird fucking reason, but he just became completely uninteresting to me and I hate his entire character arc now."
Annihilator4413,Reasonable_Carob2534,"and that‚Äôs ok too! did you find him more interesting pre-s4? 
ironically I personally fell in love with the character in s4 for more reasons than I can list."
Reasonable_Carob2534,Annihilator4413,"I did find him more interesting pre-S4. Overall still love the show, just find how Erens story ended quite bitter."

The end credits strangely enough. I remember feeling so satisfied and complete as they started to roll. The music was beautiful and it had such an air of finality to it. Then it shifted like a thousand years into the future and we see the cycle repeat in the most brutal way possible. That was truly the last thing I was expecting lol.

sgtp1,hopeitwillgetbetter,"They're ""seeking validation"".

> Validation is the desire to have someone else's approval or agreement with what you say, believe, or do. Humans are naturally social creatures. We thrive in a community and, therefore, have a strong desire to belong in that community and seek validation from it.

Generally, the more secure one is, the less the need to seek validation.  On the other hand, the higher the insecurity, the higher the need for reassurance and validation from others.

This also explains why some research says that narcissism is fueled by insecurity."
hopeitwillgetbetter,Proper-Original-6092,"Thank you so much for your comment. I have also became like them, an insecure idiot. I am addicted to this validation thingy after I joined social media. I was exhausted by the hate aot was getting after the ending I myself became a bit toxic fan. Everyone hyped season 4 way more when season 3 completed airing and everyone was exited how manga was gonna end and everyone was enjoying it. But now that manga has ended; the ending, season 4, aot everything became trash. I was annoyed because I couldn't express my excitement without getting a lot of hate by ending haters, sienen fandom and op fandom. That is why I started hating on other shows without even watching some of them. Now I feel so dumb because I was seeking validation from some random dude on internet. I can't even enjoy anime like I used to because of these dumb things. Time to leave some social media platforms because it really fucked me up for some silly reason and also time to stop interacting with toxic people. The only war I will have on social media now is waifu war and NTR vs vanilla war because most toxic one of these are funnier than war in fandom.

But overall I can't complain too much. The ending itself is good and the issues are more related to its exposition. Basically I'm saying that with a few more chapters, all the issues could have been solved.

May I ask you one thing? If you haven't read nor watched AoT, why do you keep commenting here? Just curious, nothing against it ahahah"

Sebox_,AlphaCockGigaNuts,"No, that's just untrue. As fucked up as the ending is, I have gotten over it. I have no reason to feel the same, absolute hatred I felt when I first read that atrocity of a chapter. Well played, Yams. 

But, I will say this. Erwin's entire motivation was to find out the truth behind the walls. He strived to prove his father right, that there were humans out there. With him realising that there is no love for them outside the walls, His purpose is basically over. And as a far more effective and ruthless Commander than Hange, He would take extreme measures to make sure that his island survives. Sure, be mah try to avoid the Rumbling, but if it remains the only option, he wouldn't hesitate and make sure that the entire world to trampled, so that Paradis doesent face any future threat (unlike that moron Eren, who saved like 20% of the world and Paradis still ended up getting nuked.) 

Tldr; Floch said it himself: Erwin is the devil himself. He was the Devil before Eren was. He would do unimaginable things to make sure his people live. The Rumbling is fucked up, bit it's the only way they all survive."
AlphaCockGigaNuts,Endless_Warlock,Erwin literally tries to [avoid](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Shingeki-No-Kyojin/0055-013.png) [pointless casualities](https://official-complete-2.eorzea.us/manga/Shingeki-No-Kyojin/0067-038.png) and he certainly won't kill millions of innocents for a result that [he doesn't even agree with.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/dda0ed7e729e36d12a6e05c2cb30e98f/tumblr_inline_nni3pat8Nb1touzt0_1280.jpg)
AlphaCockGigaNuts,JohnTequilaWoo,Couldn't disagree more. Erwin has never been one to sacrifice lives for no reason. The rumbling is a pointless act when there's better options available. There's no way he'd learn there are other people and cultures outside the island and then be okay with them all being destroyed.
AlphaCockGigaNuts,BurningBlazeBoy,He was always utilitarian. Doing risky strategies for him was worth it because winning a battle even with many deaths could lead to ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù ‚Äòs victory over the titans. So like the others he would prioritise the couple hundred million still alive outside the walls over the barely 1 million alive in paradis who aren‚Äôt going to be attacked for decades anyway
AlphaCockGigaNuts,RapescoStapler,Erwin would have had eren imprisoned for wanting to drag the scouts into causing a terrorist attack probably

JohnTequilaWoo,mitsukiii_29,it's from studio gek
mitsukiii_29,JohnTequilaWoo,Thanks. I quite like them. Just wish they had better audio.
mitsukiii_29,anniewinter_,"I'm a hopechad, but what others need to realise is that anime onlies are not familiar with the manga ending or ANY AOE theories and react based on what they know at that point. I think it's pretty easy to side with the alliance when you are in the midst on watching the show because you still assume there are many things to learn and this can go in many directions. Many (including me) only reform their opinion on the alliance after they see the manga ending and it doesn't satisfy them. Often that's when you find flaws, not on initial watch. So this commenter needs to touch some grass lmao"

Puzzleheaded-Row187,Duplicit_Duplicate,"Just realized, Eren must have given no fucks about the Yeagerists considering it was said he lied at the table talk in order to push his friends away so they don‚Äôt get involved with his atrocities. But then the Yeagerists are basically his personal army. 

Also the fact Eren started the Rumbling with Floch still on the walls, and how he didn‚Äôt do anything about the Alliance‚Äôs Titan powers or memories and just let them slaughter Floch and co."
Duplicit_Duplicate,Puzzleheaded-Row187,Tbf I don‚Äôt think he knew Floch was on the wall. Mikasa and Armin were there too. Not that he would care about Floch‚Äôs safety at all

Pulina_T,Puzzleheaded-Row187,"He probably would‚Äôve if he could‚Äôve. Then again, his conversation with the alliance in chapter 133 implies that he could take away Titan powers if he wanted to so I‚Äôm not sure.

Puzzleheaded-Row187,Pulina_T,"Yeah thats what im thinking. He clearly could do that man, like otherwise it doesnt make any sense with the founding powers. He just didnt care or totally forgotüòÇ. But what i hate about is him taking half measure for his friends. That makes him pathetic. Like if ur friends are the most important u have them at the top of ur mind. U dont just say it feels wrong to take away ur freedom so u can do what u wont. I wont do that in his position. He shoukdve show way more determination to make sure mikasa and armin wont walk into a fking kill zone which they realistically shouldve died by the end. It shoukdve been mikasa killin eren, but mikasa forcing her way through, not because eren let her walk into death. Like thats a factor i dont like in eren final charavter phase."

The old shitposts with the low quality ass Zook memes and everyone memeing on the scans and leaks as the new chapters came out and crazy theories like how AOT was all a precursor to the Madagascar franchise was legit peak comedy. One person accidentally posted a post that was going to be a theory with the only text ‚Äúwhen‚Äù in the title and ‚Äúwhen the‚Äù in the text body and got thousands of upvotes and was one of the top posts for that week referenced in posts for like a month. That sub legitimately felt like a home to me to just have fun and enjoy memes about content I love and it was just never the same after chapter 137-139.

NIssanZaxima,dale-is-trash,I love how much Charlie has loved the series. If you see his previous AOT reviews he has rated many of the seasons 9/10 or greater. Just really enjoy hearing someone else rave about how much the show has impacted them.
NIssanZaxima,Mango424,Historia was right. We now live in a world without titan(folk)s.
NIssanZaxima,Yoav088,"I like Charlie a lot, but personally his opinion on media has no value to me at all. I just really hate how he reviews some things, so im having a hard time understanding why anyone would care this much about his opinion, like in general about other people's opinion as if it validates your hate or somethinf..

If you really truly believe the ending was bad, why would his opinion matter to you? Does it make you question yourself? I don't understand titanfolk."
Yoav088,drinkorange11,Valid point but let's just point at titanfolk and laugh for now.
drinkorange11,NIssanZaxima,Exactly. What's ironic is since there have been a good amount of positive reviews of the new episode they have turned into man bun Eren crying into a puddle... the guy they hate with ever hair on their body.
drinkorange11,yangwenligaming,"This. I don‚Äôt even like the ending unironically but seeing the amount of yeagerbums, titanfrauds, or whatever melt down because Charlie is not shitting on it is fucking hilarious to me."
Yoav088,NIssanZaxima,Oh I am just pointing out how hilarious it is that they were so certain he would hate it and that they could use that to add fuel to the fire. His review doesn't mean much to me either.
NIssanZaxima,Yoav088,"No no, what I meant is that *THEY* cared this much about his opinion that the relied on it for so long to hopefully validate their own opinion, like as in ""Charlie thinks the ending is bad then we were right all along!""  idk I just find it kinda funny"
Yoav088,VolkiharVanHelsing,"Yeah his assessment of the story is dead wrong lol


But whatever"
Yoav088,NuuuDaBeast,Yeah even though he thoroughly enjoyed the ending I think his explanation of things were only 50% there. I‚Äôm just happy that people are getting upset at him loving it üòÇ.
NIssanZaxima,Lobsters4Dinner,This is exactly what I was hoping for with the finale. Most of the criticism is way over-exaggerated by crybabies with no impulse control or moderation and Anime Onlies are finally figuring that out. The fandom is going to go through a re-alignment and it's the best thing that could have happened. AoE/AnR is toast and Titanfolk is a laughing stock to anyone outside Titanfolk.
NIssanZaxima,Tekki777,"I don't get it. 

Like, I like Charlie, but his opinion on things doesn't impact how I view things. Doesn't mean I won't agree with him, but I'm pretty confident in my own opinions about media. Why the fuck is there a whole ass subreddit that puts their hopes and negativity on someone being overcritical and grand slamming something they don't like? 

How insecure do you have to be as a person to get to that point? I know this is reddit, but it boggles my damn mind!"
NIssanZaxima,AdConfident9579,"Now we wait for Gigguk and we can pack this sub up. Im curious what will Filmbuff say but he was very on ""ED side"" throughout first special"
AdConfident9579,Net_Flux,">Im curious what will Filmbuff say

He's already predicted about 95% of the ending, including Ymir being in love with Fritz, her connection with Mikasa and Eren ending the reign of titans. The only thing he didn't predict is the paths conversation between Eren and Armin."
Net_Flux,Memelee__,I'm pretty sure he read manga
AdConfident9579,dale-is-trash,"sorry what's ""ED side"" mean?"
dale-is-trash,AdConfident9579,"Just seem like he would be more pro ending than against given how he actually understood what was going on. Erens motivation, tribalism, cycles of hatred.

ED aka ending defenders"
NIssanZaxima,OKUIGokuBlack,His video really resonated with me cuz I picked up the anime right around when Charlie did. The anime ending fixed a lot of the weird pacing and random lines.
NIssanZaxima,Beneficial-Park-1208,"That scene where Armin and Eren are surrounded by nothing but death and a sea of blood and Eren dips his hand in to grab brain matter, teeth and hair while Armin grabs a sea shell was wicked! I always like the ending but man mappa cooked with this finale üî•üî•"
NIssanZaxima,lilscorpx,"I'm not familiar with his reactions, can someone tell me why they believed he was gonna hate it?"
lilscorpx,NIssanZaxima,Because he can be pretty critical about particular shows.
lilscorpx,Memelee__,Look man I'm a titanfolk member and I'm ngl idek why they thought that. He basically always goes with whatever opinion the majority has
Memelee__,arkthearkitect,I've never gotten that from him.
NIssanZaxima,tbu987,The guy understood and explained the ending perfectly. I'd hope his titanfolk fans listen and actually understand the ending from his mouth if they didn't like us telling them.
AdrianStars2,Ill_Gold33,Wow....i would have believed the hype would have died almost after a year with anime ending but it still being released shows that this story will still take some decades to be forgotten

pinecone4506,RusselAxel,If people saw the two of them as siblings despite Eren saying I'm not your kid or your little brother only to get offended later then that's 100% on them.
RusselAxel,pinecone4506,Exactly. I only didn‚Äôt include that line because I was referring to people who say ‚Äúin the beginning it was like that!!!!!!‚Äù‚Ä¶ when even from the beginning it was never like that. Then they go on to get mad at people who never saw them like that lol
pinecone4506,Puzzleheaded_Deal439,Mikasa also calls Carla ''Aunt Carla'' and Eren's dad ''Dr. Jaeger''
Puzzleheaded_Deal439,pinecone4506,"Yupp, like after hearing ‚Äúyour dad‚Äù and ‚Äúmy dad‚Äù in the first 2 minutes how could your first impression of them be anything other than friends? Unless you legit weren‚Äôt paying attention."
pinecone4506,pinecone4506,"I‚Äôm someone that pays attention to *every single line* and will easily rewind if I don‚Äôt catch something. (My experience with the RB reveal was very hectic). So when I heard this 5 minutes into the first episode it was clear to me. Not to mention the blatant ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not your kid or your little brother‚Äù and Ian‚Äôs ‚Äúprotect your boyfriend‚Äù made it even more clear. And in the second episode we learn her last name is ‚ÄúAckerman‚Äù and *not* Yeager. 

I honestly thought I was crazy when I saw some people say ‚ÄúI thought they were siblings from the start!!‚Äù I thought to myself, why didnt I think that? And it‚Äôs because I consume every little thing to asses what‚Äôs going on in the media I watch. And I was already used to similar scenarios like Edward and Winry from FMAB and even Barry and Iris from the Flash"
pinecone4506,meowishere,"I'll admit I did think of them as siblings in the beginning but I guess thats because my boyfriend basically made me watch it with him after a lot of persuasion so I was just casually watching and impatiently waiting for the interesting stuff to begin so that I can understand why he hypes it up so much. I did find it suspicious though that Mikasa didnt call Carla ""Mom"" during her death like Eren did and Eren's breakdown got the main focus instead of both siblings getting equal focus about the loss of their mom but I waved it off as a protagonist thing.

I also see people call EM toxic because Eren headbutted her but my very honest first opinion on Mikasa was that she is a very rude bossy big sister who hurls him on the wall or floor whenever Eren does something she doesnt like and she doesnt keep the secrets he trusts her with so I actually disliked her. So I never understood the ""slave"" argument because my perception of her was quite the opposite.

Then her backstory was revealed and I understood exactly why she behaves this way, why she said ""that again"" when Carla died and the true nature of her relationship with Eren. After she blushed when Ian called Eren her boyfriend and Eren told her he is not her he is not her brother or kid, there was no reason for me to think of them as siblings.

Now after rewatching and rereading the manga, I notice these little details in ch1 and realize it was my fault for overlooking the details in the first place which I guess happens a lot in the first episode because you're not completely hooked into the show or characters at that time."
meowishere,Puzzleheaded_Deal439,">because my boyfriend basically made me watch it with him 

respect"
Puzzleheaded_Deal439,meowishere,lol
meowishere,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"Yeah. I think you're very much intended to watch twice, only a rare few viewers will dedicate so much attention and energy into understanding on the first pass"
UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,meowishere,I mean yeah first five minutes into the show my primary concern wouldnt be whether two characters I'm seeing for the first time are siblings or friends.
meowishere,pinecone4506,"Yeah I get it, I‚Äôm not one to passively watch things especially anime where I have to actively read subtitles. So it immediately clicked for me when she said ‚Äúyour dad‚Äù plus I don‚Äôt just assume that two people are siblings without being told. So when she woke him up under the tree I didn‚Äôt assume anything. I just made this post because I saw some people saying ‚ÄúI thought they were siblings from the start‚Äù when Isayama didn‚Äôt make it that way. If you‚Äôre not paying too much attention then you‚Äôll slip past it I guess. Plus in earlier drafts Isayama thought of showing Mikasa losing her parents in the first chapter, but we get the drift anyway

All in all I‚Äôm saying that a lot of people knew from the jump that it wasn‚Äôt like so it‚Äôs just weird to me when people still try to insult people for saying that they never considered them siblings"
pinecone4506,meowishere,Well yeah I also saw in the initial draft Isayama planned to make Eren think about the memory of asking Mikasa to fight in the cabin when he got eaten by Santa Titan and to make Eren tell Mikasa and Armin that he ate his father in the Trost Arc.
meowishere,AnalystInformal5713,"Ian  was there on the wall when eren told her second time that i am not your little brother or a kid  and i think he heard their conversation and that's why he said "" protect your boyfriend"" and it is obvious how mikasa sees eren, i mean all of the other cadets know mikasa has romantic feelings for eren, some people make it a big deal like she was adopted and blah,,blah,,blah,, but she wasn't legally adopted and they were not even raised by eren parents till adulthood, there is some messy bs on guidebook but if we go by manga it is clear they never saw each other as siblings, but people are still deadset on making them siblings, some even making more ruckcus about than got and dark, i mean sure grisha and Carla would have seen her as daughter figure but that doesn't mean eren and mikasa have to see each other as siblings"
AnalystInformal5713,Koalabudderfly,They're inside the walls so I'm not sure if legal adoption is a thing yet also her position in the family would be adopted sister or just random girl living with them I guess...? Their relationship is definitely strange and problematic not because of this but how different they both are with their ideals/priorities in the relationship
pinecone4506,AnalystInformal5713,"I haven't watched fulmetal,so they have same situation like eren and mikasa?"
pinecone4506,AnalystInformal5713,"Well i won't blame people who saw them as siblings, i personally don't see them as siblings but yam and kodansha made some error and its not readers fault
First of all it is stated mikasa lost her ""foster parent"" carla in original guidebook but english guidebook turned it into ""foster mother"" we all know mikasa didn't saw them as her mother and father 
In eren's character guidebook it is stated mikasa is ""foster daughter"", i am guessing it's foster daughter  because in mikasa's character guidebook it's stated carla was her foster parent, but in english version it is stated adopted sister, i mean how can English translation be so wrong... Then there is taken in and family into adopted and brother, i don't what to think of guidebook, should i take it seriously, because guidebook  contradict itself
I don't think mikasa and eren ever saw each other as siblings"

AoR: ‚ÄúPeople will always fight!!!!!‚Äù  
Everyone with an IQ above 5: Cool. We already know that. Genocide is still better than laying down on your belly like a dog, and waiting for the outside world that hates you, to lolbomb your ass to oblivion.   
  
So why don't you come up with an actual solution. Oh, wait. You can't. Because just like you're Messiah. You'd rather sit on your hands and do nothing, until everything you knew and loved burns away. Just because you wanna feel good about yourselves.  
  
The rumbling won't wipe out all the enemies. But it will wipe out those who were furiously masturbating at the idea of murdering your eldian babies or whatever Gross-level shit the REAL racists from the outside have planned for you. The world hates Eldians. Everyone does. Maybe not women and children. But they're not the ones who'll be sending out the planes to bomb your ass. And you can't rumble around them or whatever retarded shit you can pull out of your ass.  
  
It's either 100% rumbling, or nothing.  
The ending made it clear. No matter how many clowns cope with

Nearby_Ad_6701,khaild7,"and who said that armin‚Äôs and hange‚Äôs plan was to sit and die? 

they had a plan the 50 year plan but eren ran away when they were in marley so they been looking for him because they know without the founder Paradise don‚Äôt stand a chance at surviving

with the founder no one will be able to touch the Island it can control the rumbling and summon titans of the past so even aerial attacks will still be dealt with (flying titans ,war hammer titans)

and they have iceburst stone so with their partnership with hizuru they can upgrade their military power and let me remind you that they were the first to develop an airplane which other countries couldn‚Äôt 

so they had a plan they just wanted to look for alternative Solutions first but your Messiah was too busy playing pretending in a active war zone so he can have his dramatic reveal that easily could‚Äôve been avoided if he stayed in paradise and shipped zeke on a hizuru ship to paradise that‚Äôs it, if he can meet with kiyomi in secret like he did in 107 he can do that too 

so this is the superior option if you ignore that this is a story and a stories needs conflict 

i know TF YB whole thing is ‚Äúwe understand the plot‚Äù but you really ignore everything that goes against your preferred ideas"
khaild7,tgainzz,The 50 year plan required paradise to gratuitously accept evil oppression in order to keep the oppressors comfortable when they never experienced any aggression from eldians.
khaild7,Nearby_Ad_6701,"""they had a plan the 50 year plan ""

The 50 year plan involved continuing the 145th eldian kings ideology and sacrificing Historia so that the founding titan could continue to be passed down

It involved hoping that Hizuru would continue to support them throughout that entire time

it involved hoping that Marley would not attack them within that time

It involved leaving paradis' fate up to chance, and relying on the kindness of those who just had the biggest political gathering in history celebrating how they were going to slaughter you

""flying titans""

  
Falco is the first flying titan, due to beast titan spinal fluid somehow changing the Jaw titan. If there had been other flying titans throughout history, eren would have used them

""iceburst stone so with their partnership with hizuru they can upgrade their military""

Again, you assume that Hizuru would continue to support paradis for the entirety of those 50 years. Half the people who made said deal are going to die within 10.

""shipped zeke on a hizuru ship to paradise that‚Äôs it""  


They would be found and caufght immediately. the attack on Marley served as convenient distraction so that zeke could escape. Hes literally monitered at all times?

""you really ignore everything that goes against your preferred ideas""  


No, you just hate the idea that Isayama failed miserably and AOT isnt what it once was"
Mango424,tgainzz,The rumbling is all Marley and the worlds fault. Eren and the Yeagerist were never the aggressor. So this statement doesn‚Äôt apply to them because they never stop receiving malicious aggression in the story.
Mango424,SatanLordofLies,When your point is so generic and meaningless that you have to whack the audience over the head with it to make it seem significant.

Mango424,Nobodyherem8,This is very true. However all enemies aren‚Äôt on the same scale. Political enemies vs a coalition of armies itching to bomb you out of existence are two very different enemies

Mango424,Dear-Proposal3544,Whether u like them or not I think 2 important military figures from both sides having a normal conversation and dying together was symbolic to the fact that none of this shit  would have happened if both sides communicated ( which was Marley‚Äôs fault ) and this scene was a great conclusion for both of them
Dear-Proposal3544,richrelease27,"Such a good point, I'd not looked at it like that before."
Mango424,SnooCrickets3204,I'm still amazed at the power that sub had over the perception of so many people...

Mango424,GrayCatbird7,"Heck yeah, ex-titanfolkers rise up!"
Mango424,PeterOliva,"If Titanfolk or Yeagerbomb hate a certain character and/or scene, there's a 100% chance said character and/or scene is one of the best in the whole series.

It's a quality certification."
PeterOliva,NUJosh,"100% chance, eh?

Do you like Mikasa after seeing her unnecessarily explode her own people and then shower in their blood? Then afterwards, instead of feeling bad about having to murder so many Paradisians, she instead feels bad for Annie who is apparently her best friend now I guess."
NUJosh,PeterOliva,"""Her own people"", you mean some fascist terrorists who were actively trying to kill her because she wanted to stop a global genocide? Ohhh, poor souls, she was SO BAD for THAT, she had to ask permission before killing them or maybe even let them kill her out of respect, isn't it? She was SO cruel, why didn't she feel bad for killing someone who was trying to kill her? Damn."
NUJosh,BelizariuszS,"Mikasa: gathers her resolve to save rest of the team and stop Eren and realizing she cant hesitate and proceed to scare Yeagerists away with a show of strenght to not have to kill more than neccesary

You: sHe bAthS iN tHe bLOod oF tHoSe PooR inNoceNts fOr pLeaSuRe

Idk why you ppl shit your pants so much about this scene. Obviously Mappa added it to flex some more ""badass Mikasa"" and do some second opening parrallels but after rewatching it its clear she did it to scare away the last of Yeagerists"
PeterOliva,AliMans05,"TF/YB‚Äôs hatred for Mikasa is *extremely overblown*, but she‚Äôs certainly not ‚Äúone of the best characters in the whole series‚Äù lmao"
AliMans05,PeterOliva,"Surely not ""one of the best"", because the amount of great characters is out of reach in AOT, but she can be surely put in a Top 10 without any second thought, and she's nowhere near a bad character nor one that should be hated for disgusting, hypocritical and braindead reasons like her, Annie or Gabi for that matter."
Mango424,AdrianStars2,"i actually cried in this scene, and my family was concerned lol"
Mango424,sgtp1,"I ABSOLUTELY loved this scene when I read it in the manga. I cared a little less in the adaptation because I guess I was too overwhelmed by how crazy the episode was, the animation and anime additions. Still loved tho."
Mango424,salad349,Interestingly I actually liked it more in the manga but I've always despised Magath lmao
Mango424,Windstorm72,"Liked this scene in the anime a lot more. Official translation removed anything relating to Magath being a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù, and instead just focused on individuals being proud of him. Made it feel like less of a full redemption, and rather the acknowledgment of a step in the right direction."
Mango424,lullaby-37,"No joke, I nearly shed a tear when I watched the anime. When reading the Manga, I felt sad but not to this point. Mappa really elevated this scene."
Mango424,NUJosh,hmm idk i have seen a lot of titan folkers fine with this scene. The majority of titan folk shits on the rest of the alliance.

AbsolutePCGamer,MagorTuga,"No fucking way the average anime watcher didn't have any expectations for the finale and therefore isn't as mentally derranged as the monthly manga readers who had years to theorize a million different insane ways the series could've ended.

I'm so happy that the anime got such a positive reception compared to the manga. Truly night and day."
MagorTuga,hopeitwillgetbetter,"> monthly manga readers

I just want to inform that some SNK manga readers got banned by TitanFolk (for going against the tribe)."
hopeitwillgetbetter,MagorTuga,Yeah I got banned from Titanfolk because I was the one who made the first post there announcing that Yeagerbomb had been banned lmao
MagorTuga,sgtp1,"Hey Magor, what was your opinion on the episode and did it enhance or changed anything about your views and feelings about the ending?"
sgtp1,Almadis,"Magor doesn't want that, he will hate on the episode for 10 years at least"
AbsolutePCGamer,Educational-Wafer112,"Some are going to argue that 139 is with other chapters here but that doesn‚Äôt really change much

The other chapters were criticized too,and the last part always has the most effect 


Titanfolk really was just a vocal minority"
AbsolutePCGamer,Zartron81,"Tbf, that's basically how I felt both times.

Heavily disliked it in manga, but loved it animated."
Zartron81,kiirraa97,Cause time passed since you read the manga and surely have changed your view on the ending.
AbsolutePCGamer,WhatYouSayin1,"Anime was always going to be better. It‚Äôs a better medium for AoT. 

That and the ending haters from the manga were so loud it probably dipped the expectation of anime onlies.

Also the few changes they made actually did make a difference. I didn‚Äôt like the manga ending, and I‚Äôm still not totally happy with the anime ending but it‚Äôs clearly better. Went from a 4/10 to a 6/10 for me"
AbsolutePCGamer,ParticularOccupied34,The war is over. We can rest now.
ParticularOccupied34,TheCartTitan,"I was expecting a fight and I‚Äôve seen almost universal praise, I can‚Äôt believe it man üò≠"
AbsolutePCGamer,Net_Flux,I'm pretty sure 90% of that 9.4% is titanfolktards (and other series fans) review bombing it.
AbsolutePCGamer,Depressedlizardon,I wonder if the mal userbase changed or something because I feel like seasonal popular shows couldn't as easily touch the 9.0 average before
Depressedlizardon,Braveheart132,I mean AoT isn‚Äôt just some ‚Äúseasonal popular show‚Äù it‚Äôs one of the biggest anime of the modern era.
Braveheart132,Depressedlizardon,It's also more beloved as an anime because anime is less niche than manga but I was more talking about mal in general
Depressedlizardon,PsychoSaladSong,"when a new hyped up show debuts they usually hit in the top 10 ratings of all time (think Oshi no Ko, TYBW, etc.) for a few days before they usually start dropping down in the ratings as more people start rating them as the seasons go on (or FMAB fans review bomb them to get their show back on top)"
AbsolutePCGamer,GrayCatbird7,"To be fair, both aren't exactly the same. Even if the outline and the story beats are the same, there are small but significant tweaks throughout that improve the flow and impact of the whole thing. 

Heck, even something as small as the epilogue showing Paradis developing way way farther into the future than the manga. It may not look like much, but it shoots down the recurring narrative that all Eren did was ensure an 80 year ceasefire before the world destroyed the island. Now in the anime at least, it's much clearer that the future conflict is unconnected to the events of the story. Just things like that all around that make it a smoother ride."
AbsolutePCGamer,kiirraa97,"My personal view on why this is the case is because manga readers and reddit users are way to much into the series. If there ""most logical"" ending isnt the end result they have been fantasizing for years then they go riot. 

Another reason could be the way to early judgment based on a single read trough without thinking and giving  it time to sink in and thinking about it"
AbsolutePCGamer,mg10pp,"Well done, I wanted to post a similar image too when I saw the results

In the end partly because the anime version is better than the manga one, and partly because the target audience is also quite different the reception was much better, as a series like Aot deserves"
Samix_ZLS,Puzzleheaded-Row187,"I don‚Äôt really get the hate for chapters 124-125. I mean 126 I get (the Connie stuff sucked at least) and it‚Äôs not as good as the Eren, Zeke, and Reiner centered chapters, but they‚Äôre still pretty strong. I like seeing how the characters react when everything in existence is about to be eradicated, aside from a small country that‚Äôs in shambles. It‚Äôs before the alliance or any hope of stopping the rumbling was found. I like seeing from Armin and Mikasa‚Äôs conversations that even without worrying about the outside world, the small million or less people in Paradis are still fucked for various reasons. Or Jean‚Äôs want to just drown everything out. Or Reiner and Gabi‚Äôs hopelessness in the whole situation at first."
Puzzleheaded-Row187,Samix_ZLS,It's because Eren is not the main focus probably and ngl i love all the rumbling arc even 126
Samix_ZLS,Mango424,"The ""they don't get the story"" comments are incoming, I can feel them"
Mango424,Samix_ZLS,"Yeah the comment about ""Anime onlies like it because they don't care and they don't understand"" already arrived"
Samix_ZLS,kinnell,This prediction is becoming more and more real: https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/nh5wvk/anime\_onlies\_are\_going\_to\_by\_confused\_af\_when/
Samix_ZLS,hisnameis_ERENYEAGER,"Dont understand why they would hate it lol. It was a good episode and it was exciting, the chapter was good as well. The Alliance characters are propular and Gabi's development is great. I dont think the anime onlies will hate any episode this season tbh."
hisnameis_ERENYEAGER,Samix_ZLS,"I hope so, things gonna go crazy"
Samix_ZLS,Wannabeartist9974,"I just feel good that i marathoned eps 3-6 with an anime only friend, and he reached the same conclusion that i did when watching Eren unleash the rumbling, "" he's going way too far"" he thought.

Sometimes i forget that outside of reddit and titanfolk, people are sane."
Wannabeartist9974,Samix_ZLS,"Unfortunately my friends are all manga readers, but my parents, that watch aot too and ask me questions all the time because they don't understand anything, said the same thing"
Samix_ZLS,SleepingwithYelena,The anime onlies will obviously love it but the 4 random people with 800 views is not exactly the best proof.
SleepingwithYelena,Samix_ZLS,"I know but i made it when the episode had not been released for that long, i didn't have the patience to wait üòÇ"

Samix_ZLS,FredoSantan0,what is this fandoms obsession with wanting acceptance from others jesus christ this is pathetic
FredoSantan0,BelizariuszS,"well with the whole ending civil conflict two fighting manga readers camps really want anime onlies to decide who was ""wrong"" you know"
BelizariuszS,Samix_ZLS,"Well as Erwin said ""Men won't stop fighting 'till there are one or less"". He obviously meant the Fandom"
BelizariuszS,FredoSantan0,"but who cares, the average anime only watches this shit for 20 minutes and goes on to continue with their life, they probably don't even have opinions on anything nor do they think about it more than once a week."
FredoSantan0,JohnTequilaWoo,What's pathetic is TF still bitching about the ending a year on.
FredoSantan0,Acceptable_Oven_9881,"Yes, there is an obssesion.

But both sides want to be proven right. And it's the anime only that would determine who were the ""speed readers"" and ""wrong"" about the manga."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,Samix_ZLS,Then again this is just an exagerration for the meme inspired by the fact that i saw many people say that next episodes will be a shitshowüòÇ

Stoner420Eren,RZH2Apologist,I always related to Eren until the final chapter. He fucking sucks. Even after murdering millions of people he still isn't satisfied once he achieved his life long goal. He's a lost angsty soul always looking for an enemy. And looking to be a martyr just for the sake of being one. He didn't think logically at all about what he could actually do to benefit everyone/humanity/even paradis. He's a complete fucking moron.
RZH2Apologist,ItsaMeAWaluigiSikeNo,"What's next, you relate to Hitler? Maybe Osama Bin Laden?"

If it is Jean then it's one of the very few issues I have with the story. Jean goes to visit Eren stone but not Armin? 

Also, can't wait to see Eren vs Armin when Eren is a Colossal."
Strawhat-Shawty,Stoner420Eren,"It's Jean, Armin isn't taller than Mikasa. It's not that deep, she eventually found inner peace and, like Eren wished for her, she found somebody else and lived a long peaceful life"

Credar,GrayCatbird7,"No one in Attack on Titan is arguing for open borders and the story isn't a metaphor about how it's a bad thing either. Maybe it would be if there was a faction in Attack on Titan that wanted to open the walls and welcome the titans in (even if that would kind of make no sense and have problematic implications).  If anything the issue the story deals with is the complete opposite: people are suffering for staying within their walls and they are trying to get to the other side... which is closer to what illigeal immigrants are doing than what border patrol does.

I mean seriously, the messaging through the series that walls are a problem is very obvious...

Nxwxs18,sharethebear1,"Not one specific chapter, but I'm excited for the final battle in its entirety. I was kind of let down by it as a whole when I first read it, but looking back, while it definitely has its weaknesses, it's *metal as hell*. Like the Alliance's entrance and Reiner immediately taking Monke down, Mikasa's last stand, Jean decapitating Boneren with freaking TNT, Colossal fist fight, then Armin, Mikasa and Levi teaming up to finish Eren off, it's all heavy and rich stuff. It definitely lacks the strategic nuance and depth of some of the series' better fights, but it has a very blockbuster type of feel to it that I think will translate extremely well into the anime.

That aside, I'm excited to see everything about how the extra 139 pages are covered, from music choice to animation. I think these pages form one of the most thematically profound messages in AoT, so I've always liked them a lot."
sharethebear1,Nxwxs18,"Agree with you on the extra pages. I always thought they served as a more thematic wrap of the series that‚Äôs somewhat removed from the main plot we followed, so I‚Äôm interested to see how they approach the vibe and tone of it."
Nxwxs18,Cridesio32,"The perfect adaptation for them would be them being the visuals of the final credits, like what happened in season 3 in the final episode."
sharethebear1,Cridesio32,">how the extra 139 pages are covered

My guess is that they will be either a post credits scene or the final credits' visuals."
sharethebear1,A-B-101,I also have some issues with the final battle but I think the animation and soundtrack will do a good job of elevating it and making it more enjoyable in the anime
mwmwmwmwmmdw,Elektoplasm37,"It's definitely gonna be jarring if it's done in one episode LOL, so I wonder if they're gonna extend/fiddle around with some scenes to make it so the titanization and reversion happen in separate episodes. That would at least allow for some suspense during the week in between drops and make the anime fandom shit their pants lol"
Nxwxs18,TheCartTitan,"131 for adaptation. It will surely be different from the manga because of censorship laws but I think it‚Äôs a given that Hayashi will direct it like he did part 2 episode 1 and make a very creative storyboard

134 for the visuals/spectacle

138 for peak television entertainment, this will be like two brothers all over again"
TheCartTitan,Cridesio32,">138 for peak television entertainment, this will be like two brothers all over again

Exactly, probably even better. I wouldn't be surprised if ch 138 broke the internet"
Nxwxs18,Cridesio32,138. Aot's absolute peak in my opinion.
Nxwxs18,wall-e200,138 is my most anticipated chapter
Nxwxs18,deuteronomio_,"I was skimming through what was yet to be adapted just yesterday, and I have to say, every single chapter is a banger. Like, there's always something"
Nxwxs18,stavborch,Honestly I don't feel like the very known manga panels get adapted well in the last seasons so I'm more scepticle they would do it well then excited to see what they will do.
Nxwxs18,Minisabel,"131 of course, will be an insane intro. 

Then 134, especially the first half with the amazing panels, but the entire chapter is pretty epic.

137's first half is also insane in my opinion, the dialogue is so good.

138 is pretty good but Eren retransforming makes no sense to me.

139 because seeing the reactions to it will be insane. The dialogue with Armin (which I hope they will improve), the first ending, and of course the final ending."
Nxwxs18,Kyojin05,Chapter 131 if adapted right gon be my all time favorite
Nxwxs18,Denam007,"There's no masterpiece here, we all like the real  masterpiece panel..."
Nxwxs18,I-already-redd-it-,"As excited as I am for 134, I don‚Äôt know if it can do the manga justice. These panels are so good and the double spread across the pages just isn‚Äôt something you can replicate, it was the same thing with 130. I‚Äôm most excited for 131, but I am also scared for the censoring"
Nxwxs18,FredoSantan0,"139, the shitposts are gonna go hard"
Nxwxs18,Nova_TF,"Pretty much 131 to 134, just seeing the Rumbling in action where normally such a series-shaking event would be off-screen with characters merely off-handedly commenting about it. Here, its displayed in all its horrific glory and we get to see the apocalyptic devastation Eren has caused ."
Nxwxs18,criosovereign,"137, my favorite chapter in the manga"
Samix_ZLS,invaderzz,"This doesn't necessarily mean 129 won't be adapted in the same episode. I agree with you it probably won't happen, but this only confirms that 128 will be in the episode- not that 129 will be excluded"
invaderzz,LeviFan1,Agreed especially since both are action heavy chapters and the end of 129 would make for a great conclusion for the episode with Magath/Shadis blowing themselves up for the Alliance to escape
invaderzz,Samix_ZLS,"We will see, i try to be negative so i won't be disappointed"
invaderzz,MiNi_MiLiTi,130 is like the best cliffhanger mappa can do. 131 will be a good beginning for the new season or movie.
Samix_ZLS,Enriok,"If this season doesnt adapt chapter 131 and 123, there will be a part 3 and not a movie. This would be way too much content for the movie unless they heavily cut material"
Enriok,lullaby-37,"I agree, that's wayyy too much content for a movie. I really don't want them to rush anything..."
Enriok,Samix_ZLS,Yeah with that content they could manage to have enough episodes for a part 3 if they flesh things out
Samix_ZLS,Terra_Zina,The whole final battle lasted like 5 chapters. They'll definetly extend that and add anime original scenes. I'm hype
Enriok,clbc_boy,"I disagree. If we count that each episode has 20 minutes of manga content and the movie has 2 hours (120 minutes), 1 movie can be 6 episodes worth. At least 5, because movies usually have a slower pacing.

There are 9 chapters to be adapted, so 4.5 episodes if we count 2 per 1. I think its perfect for a movie."
clbc_boy,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,9 chapters = 3 hours of movie? I'm game but idk about the box office
Enriok,proslave_96,I really hope you're right
Enriok,AyeAye_Kane,"they're already going to have to heavily cut material if the movie is going to be 1 hour long and comes after the next episode. Every episode's been about 1 chapter long and on for around 24 minutes, they've still got like 8 or 9 more chapters to cover in 1 hour"
Samix_ZLS,AbsolutePCGamer,"130 and 131 can be adapted in a single episode as they aren't that dialogue heavy.

The second half of 130 are dedicated to colossal titans approach Marley coast. That part can be adapted in less than 5 minutes.

The whole Ramzi thing can be adapted in 10 minutes. The whole freedom scene can be done over the ed sequence and the episode can end at kid Eren looking at adult Armin in paths.

That's my prediction."
AbsolutePCGamer,SlashTrike,"You're forgetting chapter 123. The common theory is that it'll be adapted with 130, since it's mostly colossal titans yeah. This would free up an entire episode just for 131, but man rn i'm a little worried."
AbsolutePCGamer,Samix_ZLS,"Hope you are right, if we don't see 131 Reiner's desire of dying won't be comparable to mine"
AbsolutePCGamer,Lermak16,I think doing the freedom scene over the ed is ridiculous.
Samix_ZLS,Ensianto,"Not necessarily. Even if they are adapting chapters 128-129, the name ""TRAITOR"" is the better one of these two, that's why it was chosen for the episode."
Ensianto,SlashTrike,"I really, really, really hope you're right."
Ensianto,Samix_ZLS,"We will see, i hope you are right"
Samix_ZLS,alPassion,"The reason it makes sense for them not covering chapter 131 this season is because ch139 takes place in ch131 so it makes sense that both of those chapters are in the same viewing. Also this is my opinion but I would actually prefer to have ch131 in the movie not only because I want it to be made with a movie budget and no censorship, but also imagine the movie beggining on Eren‚Äôs monologue on why he‚Äôs doing the Rumbling. Perfect way to start off the movie as it establishes Eren as the ‚Äúantagonist ‚Äù of the movie and gives his perpective.

If ch131 isn‚Äôt in the movie it‚Äôs a bit weird not seeing Eren the MC appearing in the movie besides briefly at the beggining (ch133) and and at the very end (ch138 & 139). I know it‚Äôs gonna annoy manga readers that we won‚Äôt see ch131 in this season but remember a delayed show is eventually good but a rushed show is forever bad"
alPassion,Samix_ZLS,Yes I'm conflicted about this because i think that it would be a great start if thete is a movie but also a great cliffhanger for the last episode of part 2 ü§î
Samix_ZLS,alPassion,Well cliffhangers are great for the first time but when u rewatch the impact is gone. Plus ending in ch130 is imo good as well as u have so many emotions when u see the flashback of Eren and the rumbling happening at the same time and it‚Äôs just ends midway through (similar to the ending of Hobbit 2 where Smaug flying to Lake town or hell even pt. 1 of s4) giving u this feeling of hopelessness of the situation but also desperation to find what‚Äôs gonna happen. Plus I think they can make that scene where Eren sees his mom killed and having those anger eyes in the flashback of ch130 somehow foreshadowment of Eren‚Äôs involvement in killing his mother cause that‚Äôs supposed to be the big twist at the end.
alPassion,Rurouni720,This is where I'm at. I wouldn't mind at all 123+130 being the season finale for part 2 and save 131 for a potential (GOAT) movie opening.
alPassion,littlewillie610,"Eren‚Äôs internal breakdown makes much more sense to me as a culmination than an opening. Even if they leave the present day Ramzi and Halil scenes for the sequel, I at least want them to adapt up to the ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù panel."
Samix_ZLS,AdGroundbreaking1873,Is 123 going to be adapted this season?
AdGroundbreaking1873,Samix_ZLS,Unfortunately we know nothing about 123 so far
Samix_ZLS,Mango424,"Of course they skip my favourite chapter, damn it lol"
Samix_ZLS,meatmaster1123,this sucks
meatmaster1123,Samix_ZLS,Agreed

kennytm,GurennoYumiyaa,Weird how Levi is in the VA cast when he says nothing in the two chapters and Falco only speaks in 129.
GurennoYumiyaa,kennytm,"Levi is making the sleeping noise I think.

It is also possible that Ep.9 only adapts 90% of Ch.127, and the ""wake up"" part (Pages 40-45) is moved to / recapped in Ep.10."
kennytm,Fali34,"Ouch :( I still think 128 doesnt have enough content for one full episode, but we will see."
kennytm,SlashTrike,Fuck :(
Samix_ZLS,Fali34,"For now just means the title is the same as 128. But I also think we wont be seeing 131 unfortunately, but who knows maybe they manage to fit 128 and 129 into one episode."
Samix_ZLS,Diego-Aguilar35,"That's the name I expected episode 10 to have, the worrying thing is the pacing of the last 3 episodes and that 127 can easily be an entire episode without stretching.             
The best scenario would be that ep 10 does 128 and a third of 129 and ep 11 does the rest of 129 and 130. So that episode 12 is ch 131."
Samix_ZLS,TheCartTitan,"Still sticking with my current prediction.

84: ch127

85: ch128, part of ch129

86: rest of ch129, ch130

JohnTequilaWoo,Samix_ZLS,No the fact that chapter 128 and 129 were going to be in one episode was just a prediction that some people made but no leaker has confirmed it from what i know
Samix_ZLS,JohnTequilaWoo,"Yeah but this doesn't disprove that rumour either, we are still on schedule for:

9- 127
10- 128 and 129
11- 123 and 130

Fandom would be even worse than now, esp with Mappas terrible way of handling Erens facial expresions in key moments"

Bro, even Titanfolk couldn't deny the dialogue changes improved over the manga. It took them a day to get upset at the 'idiot' comment."
Sonik_Phan,syamborghini,I‚Äôm not even a manga reader and can attest to this as the blowup happened instantly and was so overblown that everyone came into the finale thinking it‚Äôll suck (like myself) when it didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre truly the vocal minority
Sonik_Phan,TheLastTitan77,"This is just their newest cope. ""Ppl will soon start hating on it."" No, best thing they can hope for is for ppl that liked it actually move on and then they will brigade main subs and circlejerk about ending and AoT overall being bad and they will think this somehow changes reality that already happened. Like already every post on SnK with any criticism is just full of those ppl.

Edit Oh god, now I realized what this guy meant. That titanfolk after ending actually had diverse opinions. But it wasnt the case that those ppl got convinced ending was shit. They just left the insane asylum that titanfolk became and they could circlejerk in peace"
Sonik_Phan,CarbonBasedLifeForm6,"Bruh I'll never forget the absolute fucking OUTRAGE when 139 was live, especially since I didn't hate the ending that much"
Sonik_Phan,CHOMAMAHOT,Titanfolk actually did deny the changes were good lmao
CHOMAMAHOT,Sonik_Phan,Maybe it was just the thread I initially saw where they were saying it improved. Guess we have no choice but for EreHisu. :/
Sonik_Phan,Paclone,"Depends on the person.

For example, I already quite disliked the rumbling arc because of the constant ass pulls, lack of stakes, off-putting humor and overall not matching the tone of the series, even before 139. It had great moments(131, 134), but a lot of the Alliance moments were really badly executed.

When i read 139, i felt nothing really. I even thought I liked it at first, but honestly, I just was ready to accept any ending at the time. I just wanted the series to stick the landing. I wanted the series to be over and was ready to accept whatever ending we ended up with.

However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that despite the Rumbling arc being messy, 139 was another level. It retconned every single important event of the series and it lead to nothing. If Eren had the power to control Dina, he had the power to control all Pure Titans. Hence, he was responsable for all the deaths in the series. If this lead to something, like the end of the cycle of hatred *against Eldians*, i would understand, but it was all for nothing. 

Besides, every single character turned into a shell of themselves. It was all about love, when it never was. Honestly, if you think about it, almost every character was ruined in the ending. Historia chose a farmer who threw rocks, Eren decided he didnt have any motivation, Armin decided to care more about Mikasa feelings than the rumbling and the lives that were lost. Ymir decided to love an abuser, and Reiner last moment was to be a sniffe. Jean decided to marry a girl who never cared about him, and honestly thats quite a shame."
Paclone,Sonik_Phan,">If Eren had the power to control Dina, he had the power to control all Pure Titans.

I could imagine Dina's Royal Blood having some effect on why Eren could control her. We don't ever know the full extent of Eren's power. I wasn't a fan of that reveal since it adds unnecessary complications to the titan mechanics and implications about Eren that are hard to follow.

I take it you're majorly disappointed about ANR?"
Paclone,R7-Snake,"""retconned"" opinion rejected"
Paclone,Turbulent_Creme_1489,"If Eren were to control the pure titans to, as you put it, ""prevent all deaths in the series"" (lol), then things would've obviously played out in such a drastic manner that Eren would never gain access to the founder, or maybe even the attack titan, therefore be unable to ever control any titan. So obviously he could not do this, it violates the absolute basics of timetravel. In order for Eren to be able to control Dina that day, his mother had to die. I thought that was made pretty clear personally."
Sonik_Phan,Jerry98x,"""It's called denial stage""

Yeah... it's what they've been experiencing in the last 3 years"
Sonik_Phan,throwawayhelp32414,If they bothered putting even half the brainpower they're using to analyze Gigguk into having an original thought about the ending maybe they'd actually succeed in convincing people anything
throwawayhelp32414,Sonik_Phan,"I'm sure just by being one of the biggest meme communities of this fandom they will convince a bunch, but they'll mostly convince pretentious contrarian types like Joey ""TheAnimeMan"" whose tastes are too refined to even care about watching the final episode for the most popular anime podcast.

The people who run in these communities are entirely uninterested in having good-faith discussions of the series or trying to understand Isayama's intent behind it. If you asked any of them to even try and [Steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) what the ending was going for they couldn't do it."
Sonik_Phan,TequilaToothpick,"Why do they so stubbornly refuse to understand the story? 

Don't they want to enjoy Attack on Titan? (well obviously they don't buy nvm) Why don't they put in the tiniest amount of effort to try and understand the themes and the story?"

Sonik_Phan,Just_Collar_1743,"It‚Äôs funny how they point out a ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù stage before realizing the ending sucks, but the exact opposite happened to me.

Sonik_Phan,Turbulent_Creme_1489,Do these people genuinely not understand that art is subjective and their opinions aren't somehow the scientifically correct ones? Because it sure seems like they don't.
Sonik_Phan,RemoveINC,"Honestly I don't get it, why do people hate the ending that much? I didn't encounter a single coherent thought.

AloisEa,lilscorpx,There's supposed to be changes like when the blu ray stuff came out with the previous seasons and a new scene at the end of it.
AloisEa,Ensianto,"Yes, this is not the first compilation movie for AoT, but this time there's a new post credits scene like in the manga."
AloisEa,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"It's the director's cut of the final episodes, shown in a cinema. ""Nothing new"" is not precisely correct but you've got the right general shape"
AloisEa,FreljordsWrath,"School Castes extra scene at the end.

Also, assuming everyone at the cinema has already watched the finale, this is an easy way to experience the finale of a long running series with a relatively large group of people.

Imagine everyone screaming out of their minds while Attack Til We Are Ashes plays at the start with the Alliance fighting the Past Shifters. Then everyone laughing their asses off at the ""No, I don't want that"" scene. And then standing and saluting when TheDogs plays. And lastly the whole room going dead silent with only the occasional sniff as the credits roll.

  
I might actually go watch it."
FreljordsWrath,MellTro,Just a question. Is the Intro in the movie? watching it in cinema next week
MellTro,FreljordsWrath,"As in, The Last Titan opening? No."
AloisEa,EaseAppropriate694,I'd like to ask if I should watch the Final Chapters 1-2 before watching The Last Attack? I've watched the Final Season but not the Final Chapters.
EaseAppropriate694,Far_Philosopher_4596,if you are going to the cinema for it and you havent read the manga/don't know what happens at the end/if you have but never seen animated I would say it's more worth to wait until you see the last attack on the cinema since it's your first experience and It would make your experience a lot better and more immersive. :)
EaseAppropriate694,Nate-Pierce,"Yeah you might as well wait it out. I‚Äôm new to the series since September but stopped at Season 4 Ep 20 in October because I decided to wait for a North American announcement for this movie (at that time, it was just Japan getting it$. And finally it‚Äôs happening. My friends are calling me crazy for stopping at that exact episode lol. I‚Äôm gonna continue from there until Episode 4x28 closer to release date, then watch it in theaters the following day."
Nate-Pierce,EaseAppropriate694,Watched it in the cinema with my friend who watched Final Chapters. I can see the regret on his face buying an expensive ticket just to watch a replay of episodes 1 and 2 with added scenes lol. I'm thankful I got lazy watching those last 2 episodes.
EaseAppropriate694,Lalalandou,"Je pense que c'est mieux de ne pas les voir si tu comptes aller au cin√©ma.

AloisEa,SpaciumBlue,Attack on Titan: The Attackening
AloisEa,Chimkimnuggets,This is normal for anime. They did this for Mugen train arc with demon slayer
Chimkimnuggets,Yeezus_Fuckin_Christ,I thought Mugen Train did the opposite. They released the movie in theatres first and then they divided it up into episodes and released the tv arc.
Yeezus_Fuckin_Christ,BiddyKing,You are correct
AloisEa,Gustavo_Cruz_291,"They might be just milking it, but I'm not too against it since it may be used to fund new AoT content in the future if they exist!"
Gustavo_Cruz_291,Nate-Pierce,"Exactly! A lot of my friends are bitter at the idea of this and they pirate the crap out of anime so honestly, who are they to complain or judge? And why not milk it? It‚Äôs good business and they sure as heck deserve it. Considering this is material already seen by the majority, its first weekend box office performance alone in Japan was impressive, especially when it was only screened at 150 theaters (people need to google the total number of theaters in Japan to get the gist). It eventually expanded from limited screening to a nationwide extension, now with a 4DX experience. I say good for them. Even better now other parts world wide are getting this.

 I‚Äôm still in the middle of season 4. My Japanese friends are jealous that my first experience with the finale will be at the theaters and they are couldn‚Äôt be more right about that and I‚Äôm so pumped for this."
AloisEa,DraconicZombie,"It literally says it right there, so why are you asking?"
AloisEa,AdviceNo4960,I watched The Last Attack in cinema and I‚Äôd like to watch the whole series on the big screen with high quality sound. It was great.
AdviceNo4960,Nate-Pierce,"Parts of the series did technically receive a new surround mix through the old recap films (the ones that recaps events from seasons 1-3 in summary form). But this Last Attack movie is the best recap because nothing is condensed. This is, as someone said, the director‚Äôs cut. How I wish though the whole series had 5.1. On Blu-Ray, it‚Äôs generally just 2.0 because majority of Japanese citizens do not own a home theater. Meanwhile the English tracks get 5.1 by default, which is kind of a punch in the gut lol."
AloisEa,todorokikunn,Hello a little late but quick question. I put off watching the episodes because I knew eventually a movie would be made lol. Will there be parts from the episodes that don‚Äôt make it into the movie? Like will I have to watch the episodes after so I can see everything? Or will the movie include all scenes and extras?
AloisEa,Possible-Humor-2125,i think it would be cool when animes finish to crunch up all the main plot points and everything into one entire film to show in the movies as the final showcase with everything but not sure if its possible
Possible-Humor-2125,Ambassador-Cool,they'd have to skip/water down a lot to fit it in a watchable chunk. I'd say they should condense the show/seasons into 3 movies.
Ambassador-Cool,Possible-Humor-2125,yes imagine watching the start of AOT on a big screen.. so cool
Ambassador-Cool,Dunglebungus,"I don't think you could cut it that short. I think 6 is the minimum it could be. One for the original attack and whatever district Eren was defending when he transformed. One for the Female titan arc, one for Female titan arc + maybe some S2 stuff. One for S2 easily. One for the king/historia arc? One for retaking the wall and the basement. One for S4 stuff 1 for rumbling. Thats 7. Any less and you would have to cut entire characters. Probably the entire King/historia arc and a lot of S2 would be cut. You could maybe get it down to 5 cutting a lot of Marley background. 

For reference the series is 30 hours, which would be 12 2.5 hour movies."
AloisEa,Defiant-Ad2876,Regardless of if there‚Äôs anything new I‚Äôm glad they added more showtimes lol. It sold out so fast where I‚Äôm at
AloisEa,Evangelion217,I‚Äôm still watching it.
AloisEa,sgtbigpapi69,Just a cash grab. Which I mean it's still dope to see on the big screen! Ima go watch it üòé
AloisEa,Few_Bookkeeper_9201,"Please go see it in the theater, as someone who grew up with anime (i remember buying vhs dragonball from Suncoast video) this is a great way to support. It was also beautiful to watch it on the big screen."
AloisEa,Adam9130,i mean as a fan this is a dream come true. i wish it came out in cinemas on release but better late than never!
AloisEa,kalil_judi,what ep do i need to stop watching so i can experience AOT: The last attack for the first time?

GurennoYumiyaa,Rodranime,"Demon Slayer was like 10 minutes longer lol. 

But yeah, a longer episode as a final will be cool"
GurennoYumiyaa,AdrianStars2,still feels like 5 minutes
AdrianStars2,GurennoYumiyaa,LMAO hour long episode but you blink and it's already over.
GurennoYumiyaa,meatmaster1123,"My copium is that not adapting 131 gives them too much content to cram in a movie and too little for a part 3, so they will flesh out the ending and make it 10 eps or something."
TheCartTitan,Diego-Aguilar35,"It can still have 131, chapter 130 is to short for a single episode <‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-This guy is coping"
Diego-Aguilar35,TheCartTitan,I ran out of copium and I have accepted the chad Mappa 130 cliffhanger.
Diego-Aguilar35,alucidexit,123/130?
alucidexit,curtistaro,This seems to be most likely tbh
alucidexit,Diego-Aguilar35,"Yeah, or‚Ä¶ Ep 86 is 129/130 and they chose ‚ÄúRetrospective‚Äú because Eren is also doing a retrospection‚Ä¶  and ‚ÄúDawn of Humanity‚Äú is a weird name‚Ä¶ and has a confusing meaning‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ Kino‚Ä¶"

Enriok,JohnTequilaWoo,That works great too.
TheCartTitan,xedde25,"I hope we get the rest of 123 then...
Still sad we won't get 131 now :("
xedde25,TheCartTitan,We definitely will.
TheCartTitan,xedde25,"Ok, if we see Ramzi this season I will be happy."
TheCartTitan,RKODDP,"i dont give a fuck if the season ends in 130 or 131

 I'm worried about whether I'll see Mikasa drunk and eating ice cream."
TheCartTitan,GurennoYumiyaa,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IHATE THIS... it's alright though, this is fine."
TheCartTitan,sharethebear1,"Out of genuine curiosity, could someone inform as to why they think that 130 is a good stopping point? Yeah, the imagery itself is very climactic, but narratively it's not that big of a chapter. The only lasting impression it leaves is ""oh, the Rumbling's touched the mainland,"" and I don't know if that's really a cool cliffhanger, since we've known that the Rumbling would reach it eventually and Hange outright confirms this before the port fight.

But I'm all ears. Aside from imagery, why do some of y'all like this as an ending point?"
sharethebear1,NewCountry13,Why did they choose reiner and eren staring at each other for a part 1 ending? Only ymir knows.
NewCountry13,JohnTequilaWoo,It was an incredibly effective end point. Really got your excited for Part 2.
sharethebear1,JohnTequilaWoo,Maybe they don't? Maybe the TV station gave them 12 weeks and this is all they could adapt.
JohnTequilaWoo,sharethebear1,"No, like I've seen some genuine enthusiasm from some other AoT fans about this and I was just curious about where it came from. And while I want 131 to be adapted ASAP, I'm not like *seriously* complaining or anything. I can wait.

And for what it's worth, I don't think that's how it works. I'm pretty sure the production committee decides how many episodes they want each production to be, and then make arrangements for the appropriate number of weekly slots. It's not like NHK waltzed up to the production committee and was like ""you only get twelve weeks, make it work, bucko!"""
TheCartTitan,BelizariuszS,"Its ogre, I cant take waiting so long for 131. Also fuck hanging on 130 bs for 10 months at least"
TheCartTitan,meatmaster1123,whyy 131 would have literally been perfect to end on
TheCartTitan,Sajidchez,Why can't they just end the anime in part 2 ffs
TheCartTitan,favoredfire,"Well I'm personally bummed. I think separating 130 and 131 is a bad call. The two chapters play off each other so well and breaking Eren's flashbacks up feels not just jarring but gives a different feel to the audience, like 130 is far better understood in the context of 131 or idk if I'm explaining it well. 

Probably just my own bias to group those two together, because I can see MAPPA thinking ending part 2 with a hint of Eren's POV (130) and starting a movie/next part with it as well (131) is almost bookends, especially with the end (139 ) giving his POV again. It also ensures we get some Eren POV in both parts (or part 2 and the movie) rather than just to close off part 2 and then get nothing direct until the very end of whatever comes next.

I also really hope they don't do a movie now, fitting in 131-139 into one movie feels like too much imo."
TheCartTitan,lullaby-37,What does this mean??
lullaby-37,Rodranime,"This season will end in chapter 129, in the yeagerists vs Alliance fight in the port.

EDIT: Look the comment below"
Rodranime,alucidexit,There's still one more episode so it'll end on 130 right?
Rodranime,lullaby-37,"Oh wow...
I am disappointed I really wanted to see 131 this season. They even teased it in the opening.
Are we heading to part 3 then? No way a movie can cover everything, it would be so rushed."
Rodranime,TheCartTitan,"This is the penultimate episode. This basically confirms we‚Äôre not getting 131 this season unless the last episode is somehow longer.

130 is still an incredible cliffhanger and arguably a better way to end this part but it‚Äôs still sucks to wait so long for 131"
TheCartTitan,littlewillie610,"At this point, the best case scenario would be for episode 11 to cover 129 and the unadapted material from 123, leaving 130 and 131 for the last episode. Still, I‚Äôm running out of copium.

Another option would be for episode 11 to also adapt some Alliance scenes from 130, 131, and 132, leaving the 123 flashback and the Eren scenes for episode 12. If they did this, then the present day stuff with Ramzi and Halil would likely still need to be pushed back to the sequel."
TheCartTitan,LeviFan1,Oh man does this mean we aren‚Äôt getting 123? That would really suck tbh üòî
LeviFan1,JohnTequilaWoo,"We will get it, we just don't know when."
LeviFan1,cmpunk34,Indeed üòû
TheCartTitan,ComprehensiveDraw203,Chapter 131 deserves its own episode imo. Putting it at the beginning of the movie will severely reduce its impact and people will talk about the controversial ending more than it
ComprehensiveDraw203,JohnTequilaWoo,It might be the he season opener to part 3.
TheCartTitan,JohnTequilaWoo,"You're all overreacting massively. Once it has been fully adapted it won't matter at all if 131 is in Part 2 or Part 3/Movie.

I think it's better this way anyway. We start the next part with Mikasa's flashback with Eren asking her about her feelings and end it with her having to kill him. It ties it all together well.

That's if 123 and 131 are both in Part 3.


This is not bad news, it means Mappa are taking their time and giving the story the respect it deserves. We are not Titanfolk, let's not get irrationality angry."
JohnTequilaWoo,Eastern-Birthday2359,Wait so the next episode is the last one we gon get for some time?
Eastern-Birthday2359,JohnTequilaWoo,"No we have 4 episodes left. It's looking like 127, 128, 129 will all have their own episodes and then after a week break it'll end with either 130 or 123."
TheCartTitan,-DIrty__MARtini-,"Wait, what does this mean?"
TheCartTitan,_Alljokesaside,I don't get it
TheCartTitan,yumyumyumyumyumyum88,I trust them to figure out what works best.
TheCartTitan,Sathasiless,I'm perfectly happy with this. It's what I had been hoping for.
AdrianStars2,Qprah,"I think the disturbing imagery warning being on Declaration of War and Pride are because those are the two episodes the ""good guys"" are talking in a not-unfavorable way about murdering innocent people and genocide.

It seems to me at least, highly unlikely that AoT needs a graphic imagery warning on those specific episodes compared to as you say this one and a handful of others."
AdrianStars2,j4ckbauer,"Yeah they definitely didn't want 'our violence' to be sanitized while 'their violence' is gruesome and ugly.  

This is also why I appreciate why Floch was not shown to be stupid or incompetent.  It sends the wrong message to an audience."
j4ckbauer,BomanSteel,"See I always interpreted the heavy violence in this episode as a way to remind you that those are still people, their people, their friends from their small island that the alliance is forced to kill because Eren and Floch instilled that destructive ‚Äúkill or be killed‚Äù mentality into them. 

I never saw it as them making sure The alliance‚Äôs violence wasn‚Äôt sanitized but that actually an interesting way to look at it"
BomanSteel,j4ckbauer,"I think your observation is correct also... different things stand out to different people which is why we have discussions like these :)

Its funny in other stories, the 'good guys' go up against 'criminals' or 'bandits' or whatever and its like happy happy fun violence.  In AoT 'our guys' go up against their own, some of them outright fascists, and you get a literal 'rain of blood' O.o

There is 'almost' a sanitized violence scene like what I was talking about in the moment where Mikasa and the Azumabito get cornered at the bottom of the stairwell and have guns pointed at them.  But alliance people take out all the yeagerists (3 I think) with simultaneous headshots and there's only a small amount of blood, I was like 'that was easy' lol."
AdrianStars2,Sir_Toaster_,"Connie after killing a fascist terrorist in self-defense looking at Reiner, the man murdered thousands of innocents: We're the same..."
Sir_Toaster_,RegularLeather4786,Connie wanted to kill an innocent kid for a chance to see his mom again
AdrianStars2,Predator3-5,The anime cut back a lot of the gore. The manga had some crazy gore scenes that unfortunately got toned down in the show
Predator3-5,Sir_Toaster_,There was one panel where a girl was giving her dead boyfriend (whose lower half was missing) CPR
Sir_Toaster_,Predator3-5,Yeah that was the same scene from that first arc after training. Unfortunately the show blurs out a lot of the gore
AdrianStars2,ToothpickTequila,"The Alliance were totally morally justified in their actions in this episode. They were fighting for their lives. Mikasa with her actions even managed to scare a few Jaegerists away and saved their lives. 

The Alliance approached the situation with the intent to not kill anybody. You can blame Floch for all of the deaths that happened."
AdrianStars2,Sir_Toaster_,Wouldn't it be more accurate that their heads were blown off not holes all over them?
Mysterious-Tutor-942,Mysterious-Tutor-942,"Up until the Jaegerists started shooting at Conny she was using non-lethal moves against them. She kicked and then shoved a gun into the face of the two Jaegerists about to kill Kyomi (funnily enough, the Yaegerists probably killed them themselves when they blew up the room) and she kicked the guy in mind air who tried to thunderspear at Annie, doing the same to one of the Jaegerists who was shooting at the Azumabito. Only when they start shooting at Conny does she start directly killing Jaegerists, to which immediately afterward is the line ""Hesitate, and we'll never stop the Rumbling/and my Friends will die.""

Just my observation"
Mysterious-Tutor-942,Puzzleheaded-Row187,"People are really bending over backwards to call act like this is the worst thing done in fictional and human history. I even saw a comment on Berserklejerk comparing Mikasa killing Yeagerists to Griffith killing his friends and comrades during the Eclipse. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Mikasa definitely isn‚Äôt a good person. She‚Äôs done awful things and has blood on her hands. But you‚Äôve gotta be a special kind of biased to compare her to fucking Griffith, who‚Äôs debatably more evil than Eren (if nothing else, he has less redeeming qualities than Eren)"
Mysterious-Tutor-942,Warm_starlight,"You think her punching or kicking someone is not lethal with the amount of weight she can carry? She pushed a gun back into someone's skull with sheer force of her hand. I really doubt those ppl will get up again..

One of their head bent in a weird position as he was smashed to the ground, the other one had blood splatter out of his head when he hit the wall... they definitely died."
Warm_starlight,Mysterious-Tutor-942,Idk about that. She kicked the one guy during that Sakuga scene pretty hard and he survived with a pretty bloody nose until she finished the job with her blades.
Mysterious-Tutor-942,VolkiharVanHelsing,"People were mostly complaining about her fatality-esque detonation of the two mooks, not her overall aggression against her enemies"
VolkiharVanHelsing,Mysterious-Tutor-942,"It‚Äôs a bit a both from what I see. The explosion just underscores for SOME people the underlying ‚Äúsavage, uncaring, brutal, sadistic‚Äù what have you ‚Äúdog‚Äù Mikasa is. 

For the reason the explosion there, there‚Äôs a bunch of coherent rationalizations one can make as to why Mikasa did it, but the reason it‚Äôs there is because it looks cool at the end of the day. Those remaining Jaegerists did flee after it, though, so I suppose that something."

Read to the end to understand

Mikasa is a killing machine, the closest thing to the Terminator.

yes, she used non-lethal moves at the beginning, but you don't have to be an idiot ( I mean the characters ) to know that it would be short lived

I think killing the guys with the thunderspears and bathing in their blood was unnecessary ( in the context of the AOT world, because for the viewer it was AMAZINGLY GREAT ).

But I digressed a bit

The harbor battle was not Mikasa's fault, nor Connie's, nor the yeagerists, shit even Floch is innocent.

The great fault, of the great slaughter to humanity, are Eren and Historia.

Floch was used as a puppet by Eren to fulfill his part of the plan to provoke Mikasa.

Historia, she is an idiot, she was too cowardly to turn against Eren and let herself be coerced into having a child, she preferred to save herself than the world...which clearly sets her apart from Mikasa

Mikasa, Connie ,Samuel, Daz, that poor girl who almost killed Mikasa ( and Jean saved her again BTW ) were just soldiers in different positions, used as cannon fodder for Eren's mega plan and Historia's cowardly silence"
RKODDP,Mysterious-Tutor-942,"Definitely agree on that front. I've seen a lot of people dismiss the 50 Year Plan as ineffective because of the advancement of technology, but because of how broken the Founding Titan is I really don't see how that's much of an issue. A few Colossals go down? Cool, spawn a couple more because apparently, you don't require Eldians to make those things. Any force attempting to attack Paradis would be overwhelmed by an endless onslaught of Titans as long as you keep the Founder and a Titan with Royal Blood in a safe location."
Mysterious-Tutor-942,RKODDP,"The problem I see is that this plan does not prevent Ymir from continuing to build titans, and as long as they exist, the problems remain the same.  
Paradis having the Founder still maintains the same status Quo since King Fritz."
RKODDP,JonViiBritannia,"I agree with everything except the thunderspear explosion being overkill. She double tapped him (he was dying but still alive and had guns/thunderspears) and got rid of the thunderspears (which other soldiers might‚Äôve picked up) in the process. In the words of Jorge Masvidal (MMA fighter, who was asked whether hitting a downed but not officially KO‚Äôd opponent was necessary) ‚ÄúIt was super necessary‚Äù."
JonViiBritannia,RKODDP,">I agree with everything except the thunderspear explosion being overkill.

Is debatible....but was a fucking awesome, NGL"
RKODDP,kinnell,"Very well said.

With regards to Historia, I don't think she got *coerced* into having a child. Her character arc is her learning to live and be true to herself. I think she had wanted to have a child and saw it as a way out foiling the MP's plans. While she originally did put up resistance against Eren's plans, I do agree that she was ultimately too cowardly and became complicit with her silence. (Eren did threaten to wipe her memory but she could have told Mikasa who would have have been immune to it). Ultimately, she was getting what she wanted so she went along with it."
Mysterious-Tutor-942,sgtp1,"I made a thread here on this sub about this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AttackOnRetards/comments/tjfpqx/i_just_realized_something_while_rewatching

But yes, I totally agree. People are overseeing this a lot, and so many apparently just think Mikasa were having the time of her life killing them. üòî"
Mysterious-Tutor-942,JohnTequilaWoo,Mikasa was just doing what she had to do to survive and protect her friends. Blame Floch for ordering his goons to try and kill her
JohnTequilaWoo,ScaryReptile,"I would really blame floch for this, both sides are truly just fighting for what they believe in. I feel like the ideals of the yeagerist would have formed in some capacity no matter what because of how little anyone knows about the out side world"
Mysterious-Tutor-942,Wannabeartist9974,"Honestly, i think we're all taking this scene way too seriously, yes, Mikasa blowing up a thunder spear was unnecessarily brutal and ruthless (pretty awesome tho), but like it's a few seconds clip, it's not going to break her character for me, it's clear it was done for the sake of having a cool scene rather than anything else, and it's also clear to everyone watching that the sake of this battle was showing the brutality of the conflict.

It's also hard to me to take seriously the complaints that are coming from fans that were pretty much already hating on Mikasa before she did any of this, or even hating Connie for shooting Samuel and Daz, sounds to me like they ignore the point.

Maybe it's because i've been a little out of touch with the fandom lately (for my own mental health) but idk, all this arguing just seems pointless to me, like making a mountain out of a molehill."
Mysterious-Tutor-942,RKODDP,and....the detail is.........?
RKODDP,Mysterious-Tutor-942,Explained in my comment.
Mysterious-Tutor-942,KaiserAsztec,"It's not about the killing, it's about the actual desecration. Blowing up two dead bodies for no reason, only to shower in the blood? If that's not overkill, then what is it?"
KaiserAsztec,JohnTequilaWoo,It worked in scaring off the remaining Jaegerists and took away one thunderspear.
JohnTequilaWoo,KaiserAsztec,Wasting a thunderspear to blow 2 bodies up? Couldn't she steal it?
KaiserAsztec,yaldafigov,"I've always been pissed off by the amount of fanservice around mikasa and how often we see ultra-violence from mappa. so did the wit. but I just laughed at this scene, I understood its message, but I won‚Äôt take the animators‚Äô fantasies seriously"
Mysterious-Tutor-942,No-Phone7057,Mikasa in anime series and love action movie both place is sh!t. Mikasa is always annoying .
Acceptable_Oven_9881,alucidexit,"Lucid Notes: 

- The whole episode felt much more cinematic

- I know a lot are complaining about the pacing, but I personally prefer it like this. Let's things breathe. There's so much going on in this battle, it's good to give each beat proper time to digest. 

- OST during Zeke's resurrection üëå

- The added drums (?) I believe during this rendition of Ashes were a bit distracting. Drew attention to itself a bit. 

- Magath reuniting with Gabi was great

- The brutality of the anime only additions in this fight are great and really drive home how dark and depressing this conflict is. 

- ... interesting rearrangements. I'm thinking that's how most of this season will go as I have no fucking idea where they're fitting 123 flashback. 

- ED was beautiful and I love the name"
Acceptable_Oven_9881,BlonglikZombie,"CGI, direction, OST, voice acting, everything was top notch."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,Aggravating-Letter17,I'm glad they didn't censored zooks ass üóø
Acceptable_Oven_9881,proslave_96,That scene of Marleyan soldiers vs the scouts was one of the best directed scenes of the entire show. Titans movement was sexy as hell. OST was hype as fuck. Voice acting on point. Direction on point. Opening fucking slapped. Ending fucking slapped. ALSO WE GOT NAKED MONKE.
Acceptable_Oven_9881,Sathasiless,"I liked the extra emphasis we got with how bad Paradis was doing during the fighting before Zeke shows up.  


On another note, it was odd seeing Floch and the other Jeagerist looking sad at what happened to Levi, then immediately after offering to finish him off lmao."
Sathasiless,Abject-Balance6742,"I think it was a good addition that showed even if Floch is one of a douchebag, he still had respect for Levi. Same with other people but that respect easily got foreshadowed by the thing he says later on."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,cmpunk34,"Hope the people from the beginning of this sub come out of their hibernation for the anime.

My thoughts on the episode :

Zeke's ass ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
Acceptable_Oven_9881,RyEdgyGuy,"Fucking awesome

Gabi and Pieck's reaction to Pieck's severed hand was funny

Titan fights looked really cool with them brawling

So many of the Paradisians died, it surprised me when they were all falling from the buildings

What are people's opinions on the ODM gear user's CGI? (I assume it was CGI) I think it improved overall (from the small parts we've seen), it was cool to me how they were spinning around and it also seemed that they weren't afraid to show off their CGI with how that one guy's face was closely shown."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,TarekBoy44,"The episode was absolutely incredible, 95% of the animation and Cg was top notch, the only thing i was exited to see and was disappointed by is the shot of Pieck with the cannon on her back, it was pretty lackluster in my opinion. Besides that and a couple other awkward shots, my only complaint is about the pacing, not that it's bad,hell, it's great, it's exactly the type of pacing i wanted for the rest of the series,BUT GODDAMIT I WANTED TO SEE EREN ALMOST RIP REINER'S JAW OFF AND ZEKE SAVE THE DAY, I DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK FOR THAT

Ps: the additional scenes of the Paradis and Marley soldiers are horrific and on par with the additional scenes in episode 1 of part 1."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,HOODIEBABA,"Disliked the OP originally but I'm liking it more now. ED is great.

Except for a few janky shots, the animation was great too. (10/10 for no blur filter)

Paths was pretty af. Too bad we couldn't see Zeke's glorious dong.

[Eren's move against Reiner and Porco reminded me of this.](https://youtu.be/JNAXOFSp1u8?t=18)

Onyan is the only outsider I care about. The yeagerist part of my heart was hurt seeing the SC get [massacred](https://imgur.com/a/4K0hDc4).

Once again ED is great. Looking forward to Yelena's T pose in next week's episode."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,salacario08,"Bro I‚Äôm just lowkey pissed at the way Levi is treated by the Yeagerists - when he saved humanity a hundred times over but is repaid with  a near bullet to the head when he needed help. 

It‚Äôs impractical but mans could have gotten medical help and been in prison or something rather than be straight-up murdered (he isn‚Äôt but he almost did)"
salacario08,Acceptable_Oven_9881,Yeah. And I‚Äôm very sure he has saved like half of them before. Imagine in Floch got him medical help and somehow convinced him to join the Yeagerists.
salacario08,BelizariuszS,I mean he would probably try to murder them first chance he would get after feeling better.
salacario08,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,"but he imprisoned Zook! He's too strong to be left alive, he could be dangerous. And he's probably got too many sympathies to the old regime and survey corps to cooperate in the glorious new Eldian Empire. He deserves to be shot in the head for Serumbowl anyway"
salacario08,Mnawab,ya but hes against the Yeagerists. he would fuck their plans if hes left alive. doesnt matter that he saved their life once.
Acceptable_Oven_9881,addictionaries,"I can't be objective in the slightest because aaaah, it's back, I'm so exciteeeed

The episode was great and I can't stop listening to the opening, goddamn, they really encapsulated the finale perfectly.

Also, Zook's ass üëÄ"
addictionaries,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,">I can't stop listening to the opening, goddamn

Right? I've bounced between it on repeat, and a playlist of it + the ED on repeat

>Also, Zook's ass üëÄ

Right!?"
Acceptable_Oven_9881,TheCartTitan,"Just rewatched it, what an episode. Felt so cinematic and the Titan fight was such an improvement from Part 1. 

I see the intro already has 3 million views and rightfully so, it BANGS and so does the ED. Glad these finally kill the whole AOE thing as well.

Favorite moments: Zeke intro (OST was incredible), Eren vs Reiner hand to hand, and all of the anime original shots of the infantry fighting - that was hands down the biggest improvement from the Manga where it didn‚Äôt feel as gritty and gruesome as here.

So happy with the season so far! Hope everybody enjoyed, this‚Äôll be a wild ride."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,yaujj36,"You know I really feel more like Titanfolk than Titanfolk itself. Like take the positive aspects and use it here. The flairs in this sub is also unique here as well. We already have analysis, discussion and some memes here to make ourselves a substitute of Titanfolk"
Acceptable_Oven_9881,lameusernamename,"I noticed they really took their time with this episode, had some pauses, shows detailed animation and additional scenes compared to part 1 where they had to rap through their dialogues lol. Just an observation, im satisfied with both."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,Manatee_Shark,One of my favorite shows of all time. Great episode.
Acceptable_Oven_9881,yukiholly,How tf did you guys watch it?
yukiholly,nzm3883,9anime.to
nzm3883,yukiholly,Thanks pal. I didn‚Äôt think it would be there that quick
Acceptable_Oven_9881,redtroy321,"I thought the official sub version was coming out in 1 hr or so? 

Is the one that's currently out just fan translation?"
redtroy321,HOODIEBABA,yeah. Official ones take around 5-6 hours.
Acceptable_Oven_9881,intoTheStarrryNight,"Dunno why but mappa style isn't for me. Anyway... I don't have any strong opinion or interest... 

 Anyone got idea which episode will they anime chapter 126-127?? I just want to see alliance."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,RKODDP,"two chapter in one episode

IDK, the chance of ending in 131 are 30/70 now"
Acceptable_Oven_9881,hopeitwillgetbetter,"The episode felt dense to me, lots of content.  *And I'm resisting the urge the review the manga cause back in early 2021, I was so excited and so happy about the finale that I reread the whole manga and re-watched all the episodes.*

And the same thing happened b4 with S3...  reread the whole manga and rewatched all the episodes.

No no no no, must stay calm and chill.  Relax, must be zen."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,yaujj36,"For me, the only thing I am hype about was the Marleyan paratroopers and they do not disappoint. The rest, well I am not expected so not much opinion, still good though. Although I really dislike the Current Info for being so useless and sad to see only Marley paratroopers, would have been interesting if they add other countries paratroopers and some Eldian unit to show the world is against Paradis."
yaujj36,Jihadist_Chonker,Magath said that it would have taken six months to gather a global front against Paradis. Reiner convinced him to attack immediately with only Marleyan forces to catch Eren and Zeke by surprise
Jihadist_Chonker,yaujj36,"Well I did think about it and found logic in it. Since Marley also want to lay claim Paradis which is also why they went to war.

Still it can be represent in the form of volunteers but then again, I doubt the world attack by airborne plan would be that swift. In the end, you are right."
Acceptable_Oven_9881,RKODDP,"Animation??? Much better

good job here

Opening..lacked a little"

RusselAxel,cmpunk34,"A much needed commentary on the blatant misuse of ""objectively"".

I have seen so many horrible takes on the ending and these takes were ""objectively"" the truth.

Big example was people unironically believed Eren became a bird lmao. Japanese have a traditional belief that the dead visit their loved ones on their death anniversary in the form of an animal. 

And some other criticisms i have seen seem too damn nitpicky that it is annoying.

Yes the ending lacked execution but to say that it has no meaning is not true at all.

But great write up OP!"
cmpunk34,RusselAxel,"Yeah I've seen many people use the word objectively just to make their own cover up their own bias or just win an argument.

Viewing art in totally objective terms is impossible.

Thanks for the compliment man!"
cmpunk34,nakulane,"Eren did become a bird. 

1. The memes are great.

2. He would have the highest character growth among all Animanga characters: Human--> Bird--> Tree

3. Blatant use of bird symbolism that doesn't seem like ""symbolism"" anymore: Seagull looking at Armin after Paths talk in 131, Falco's memory shard from the perspective of the bird.

4. No bird goes out of its way to wrap a scarf. This is simply not what normal birds do. It makes sense that it is Birdren because he did not want Mikasa to forget him for 10 years at least."
nakulane,riuminkd,5. Ellen becomes dove (crying) as was stated in the leaks
nakulane,cmpunk34,Lmao
nakulane,VolkiharVanHelsing,AoT's bird symbolism is still better than DITF tho
RusselAxel,HOODIEBABA,">YOU and I are not the perfect people to critique it because we haven't personally experienced the culture.

Agreed. I was laughing at the absurdity of the bird-scarf panel until some japanese dude on r/ShingekiNoKyojin explained that in their culture, they believe the dead visit their loved ones (figuratively) in a reincarnated form or something."
RusselAxel,soham_sharma69,Just completed reading it.Thanks for this well thought out post! This fandom needs to understand this.
RusselAxel,lucv2004,"I fully agree with your objectivity argument, but the ""it's just the Japanese way of romance"" argument crumbles once you read any other manga, or japanese media in general. Berserk's romance between Guts and Casca is subtle, but I still notice mutual affection and care between them. There are no extravagant displays of their love, but all their romantic moments come off as completely genuine. With EM, I see none of that. All their moments are just Mikasa loving him and Eren giving her none back (sans two scenes, one in 50 and one in 123). I still believe EM was always endgame because of the whole red-string of fate bullshit, but Isayma executed it in a terrible way."
lucv2004,RusselAxel,"That's just the thing that I was trying to explain my dude.

We don't FULLY understand their culture and their nuances, romantic gestures and all the tropes associated with love so we can't leave a logical comment on it like, at all.

It's just not possible until we experience it.

And like I said my man, WE are not the intended audience for the manga, the intended audience sees it in the way as intended by the author, so calling it terribly executed doesn't stand here since we use a different judging criteria than them.

EDIT: Also your argument of saying that my statement on ""It's just the Japanese way of romance crumbles"".. well, not really, the Japanese culture today is not the same as it was and must have been years and years ago, culture also evolves and changes.

The culture of the Reiwa Era is and will obviously be vastly different than what it was in the Showa Era."
RusselAxel,lucv2004,"You missed my point entirely. I was saying I‚Äôve read many other manga and anime and in most of them the romance is very clear cut. Take for example Ed and Winry‚Äôs relationship in FMA:B, a *Japanese shonen manga* made for the same audience as AoT. It‚Äôs a romance where both sides‚Äô feelings are clear and mutual. Hell, the other romances in AoT itself are very, very obvious. Ymir and Historia clearly loved each other. Same with Falco and Gabi, and funnily enough it was conveyed in the least subtle way possible. In EM‚Äôs case, Eren‚Äôs feelings for her are very confusing up until chapter 139. 


Also, aren‚Äôt multiple, diverse points of view important in objective criticism? Why should only Japanese people be allowed to criticise a manga? Extrapolating from your logic, you shouldn‚Äôt consume any media unless you‚Äôre the exact target audience for it."
RusselAxel,VolkiharVanHelsing,"The ""shy"" culture can only be used as an excuse for so much. Hell, Falco and Gabi depicted that love culture amazingly with the one-sided confession.


And like the original commenter said, it's ignoring a fuckton of other romance stories from Japan (sure some may have this ""cultural barrier"" issue, but those are not considerably more popular than those with enough build ups to begin with).... They can absolutely deliver a story with their cultural touch and yet still have build up."
RusselAxel,VeloKa,"To be honest, when people talk about romance between EM most of the time they refer to the anime not manga.

Just to point a few differences

A) The eternal love flowers is anime only

B) The red scarf is actually black in all cover art

C) so many EM moments where actually added in the anime to replace Armin, or just added from scratch. 

D) Isayama admitting that he wanted to have the two kiss in ch 50 but the reason he didn't was because he was shy and **didn't know how to develop their relationships afterwards**

Regarding the cultural differences, I think it is fair to point out that a lot of the fanbase outside of Japan who watches it are probably neither new to anime nor anime trops. So a failure in reading these ""cultural related stuff""  might not even be a lack of  cultural understanding, nor is the fanbase outside of Japana entirely western. Many shonen throw romance completely to the side and generally speaking they are very poorly represented. Past chapter 50 I would argue with anyone that EM dynamic prior to the Marley timskip was among the weakest aspect of aot writing, primarily because it is completely lacking. The total amount of times the two interact on page for a period of 2 year serialization is probably 2 times a total and it's not even in a romantic context. And this is coming from someone who always knew that EM is endgame. ( seriously it's not that hard to figure out that the two main characters are gonna be involved in a romantic sub plot, this is as ancient as literature itself) 

To be honset once again. I don't think Isayama represented Eren's love for Mikasa or care towards her well enough, I think he took it for granted that them being childhood friend implies the above. I think a lot of the audience does. 

I never had an issue with Mikasa's adoption and I think this argument is nonsense. Mikasa fell in love on day one, this is hardly incestuous. And the response of the two only living together as family for one year only seems like a weird response as well, because Mikasa and Eren are family narrative wise. Eren has a responsibility towards her.

I think denying that connection between the two takes away the very complexity of their dynamic. But I don't think personally that Isayama explored its complexity well enough in the earlier part, and it wasn't intentional either from a story telling perspective to abandon their relationship for half the story, it was primarily due to him not knowing how to write it, and that needs to be acknowledged instead of covering it up like it's taboo to point out that outside story sources effect the story."
RusselAxel,VolkiharVanHelsing,"Objectivity in regards to the art piece as whole is not possible, however you can dissect aspects of it and puts numerous metrics to make it objective.


For example: Rob Liefeld. Liefeld, compared to say, Jeff Watts, is objectively inferior in depicting accurate human anatomy. Does this make Liefield's drawing objectively bad, or Watt's objectively good as art? No, but if we are judging solely off the metric of ""accurate human anatomy,"" Watts is clearly objectively superior in this metric. And again, bearing in mind the goals of said art, if Liefeld was attempting to depict the human form accurately, his error in his anatomy would be all more egregious.


Also, a correction: The scarf was not red in the manga, it was Grey or Green. Only the anime dedicated to make it red for that symbolism (which is so overdone tbh)"
VolkiharVanHelsing,RusselAxel,"Yes, I stated the exact same thing in my post that it's possible to dissect some aspects, not all but coming up with a framework to do so is extremely difficult. 

I never stated that the scarf was red in the manga, just said it was red.

I'm not 100% sure about this, but I read a comment from a user a few days ago that in the official color manga the color is red.

And I also read somewhere that Isayama appreciated the color change in the anime so there's that too."
RusselAxel,Dependent-Rice-7308,"I see and can agree in some level but the manga industry has been international long before aot was created, and japanese culture isn't very present in it, not in the themes or in the ambient.The main themes of aot aren't constricted in one culture, they are very global: japan isn't the only country that got trough war,hate,discrimination,desire for freedom . There is a theme of gaining freedom/independence in old japanese folklore but the way it's portrait is very different.If  Yams intent was to create something only for his country he did it in a very bad way"
RusselAxel,cmpunk34,You are *free* to do so
TarekBoy44,I-already-redd-it-,You need to check out the uprising arc. So much good Mikasa content that was cut.
I-already-redd-it-,TarekBoy44,"I'll get there in a bit, I'm currently at chapter 12, when Pixis shows up."
TarekBoy44,DarkRose27,She's so much better in the manga that it's actually insane. It's so unfortunate that most people will only watch the anime because she (and a few others) got shafted by the adaptation & it heavily skews peoples perception of her.
TarekBoy44,muskian,"I don't know, the manga's sketchy style never really lended itself to high clarity. Colour and sound and the different styles of each season does leaps in building expressiveness. Add the voice acting and you can rely on more than facial inferrence. Expression does build character, but honestly, I never felt Mikasa's were more distinctive than any of the other cast who show intense emotions while also benefiting from more dialogue driven stories. 

The ideas they convey end up being pretty basic anyway. Most of the time its just ""I'm sad about Eren""."
TarekBoy44,Iewoose,"Eh, i don't see that huge a difference tbh."
f13ry_,GurennoYumiyaa,"Meh the best part was how the music stopped in that moment and there was clear focus on the voice acting, Grisha and Eren VAs did a amazing job."
GurennoYumiyaa,RyEdgyGuy,"Yup that was clearly an artistic choice to do that.

(Pretty related, I don't think i watched any manga edits/motion manga videos about this scene, have you watched any and were the music blaring really loud in those manga videos? Because that seems like something that people would do because they don't have access to voice acting.

If this is the case, then this really is just like a Declaration of War moment again where people watched those videos first and then expected the episode to follow the same style, except slightly different this time)"
RyEdgyGuy,GurennoYumiyaa,"If i remember correctly there was a motion manga video that had OsK playing while the scene was happening and that was pretty popular but i never watched it, can't seem to find it now though."
GurennoYumiyaa,f13ry_,Ik. It was amazing. These people are just so miserable every week
f13ry_,GurennoYumiyaa,I can understand since there were inconsistent designs where the characters didn't look the best but i think people just exaggerate.
f13ry_,slam9,Wait the episode is out for you? What platform do you watch it on? It's not out on Crunchyroll yet
f13ry_,proslave_96,Bruh they literally played an orchestral remix of 0sk which sounded way more epic. These people just hate on Mappa's adaptation for the sake of it and that's a fact.
proslave_96,slam9,Where are you guys getting the episode so early. It's not even out yet on Crunchyroll
slam9,8aash,twitch streamers. you want a link?
f13ry_,8aash,"wait... people are still stuck on the ""Eren didnt know why he did the rumbling"" argument?üíÄ

I give up."
8aash,f13ry_,Ikr? So fucking dumb. The lack of reading comprehension is astounding. And then we got wit fanboys who shit on mappa every episode. Like a can't with these clowns
8aash,Fali34,Permanent damage on the manga that will last forever since people refuse to educate themselves.
8aash,Zergrump,"Yup. If people were just poking fun at it I wouldn't mind, but they legit despise that whole scene and take it too literally."
f13ry_,Shankzulla19,Some folks will find any reason to complain.
f13ry_,AwayAtKeyboard,"""They didn't use 0sk""

Bruh I swear they're straight up not even watching the same show as the rest of us."
f13ry_,I-already-redd-it-,"I def prefer the ost choices of Wit over Mappa, there are a lot of better choices in some scenes, but cmon people. It doesn‚Äôt ruin the show. I feel that utter silence during the manipulation scene was the right choice"
f13ry_,MtnDrewz,"First half of the episode did look dodgy at times, you have to admit. And don't get me started on that Frieda frame... But other then that, it was a great episode"
f13ry_,RKODDP,"When Mappa decides to do his part and give other nuances to AOT, it results in a masterpiece.

Just like they did with the time bullet in ""Two Brothers"" or Eren's memories in the same title""

This chapter was not like that, it was an adaptation closer to 1:1 which is not bad, but as we already know the whole story, it is expected to see other things, another direction or art management, something that was not seen here.

Average episode"
RKODDP,f13ry_,"This episode was not average lol. The voice acting, especially Grisha, and the facial expressions sell this episode. And wdym 1:1 is an average episode? So many episodes from season 3 part 2, the RtS arc were 1:1 panels pulled straight from the manga. Only difference is now there is voice acting, colors, OSTs, and animation. For example, Erwin's speech was a 1:1 pulled straight from the manga, and it's praised as one of the best episodes from aot. Only difference from the manga was Erwins's VA putting all that emotion into his speech. Same with Grisha in this episode. You can hear the anguish and horror he went through, and his facial expressions, body language, and voice acting proves it. So no, that's straight crap"
f13ry_,RKODDP,"I disagree

Anyways"
f13ry_,KaiserAsztec,"I just can't understand the decisions that Mappa or the directors are making. They are using such bad angles and plans. The copied WIT scene and the cave scene were pretty good even with the inconsistent faces. But Grisha's breakdown was horrible. Making jumpcuts between identical plans, making the character jump from one side of the plan to the other is an amateur mistake that they teach you in Universities not to do."
