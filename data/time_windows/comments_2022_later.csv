Some simple character development with his power ups showcasing how power just takes away more of us freedom post Return would have been great.

It was a clear theme up to then:
1.Threatened by the garrison.
2. Imprisoned 
3. Subordinate to Levi.
4. Babysat until he is kidnapped.
5. Literally at Historias mercy.

Hell it starts before he gets his titan powers.

Instead, he gets nearly unlimited forsight, immense power, and apparently bootstrap paradox’s his way into genocide.

We get his constipated face after kissing historia, and he actively fucks with the timeline.

They don’t earn his mental breakdown.

Barjuden,SnooRobots281,"Ok so your views on it is full of misconceptions:

1) You can have that one

2) Eren didn’t leave 20% of the population to survive, the Mikasa killed him by he destroyed 80% of the population outside the walls.

3)It’s because Eren freed her by giving her the choice to give Eren the founding titan ability, Eren giving her a choice for the first time in her life is what incentivised her to do the rumbling… She also wanted Mikasa to inspire her by killing Eren.

4) Ymir saw a woman who was willing to protect a man at any cost because of her love for him and she couldn’t let go of him (Mikasa), that’s the parallel. Not whether there was love or not in their respective relationships but the need to always be their for their lover and to always fulfil their lovers wishes.

5) In chapter 139 we see a shot of Grisha giving Eren his name and Grisha says how Eren is free.

That clearly indicates to the reader if you have good reading comprehension and you knew what Eren was seeking the most that, his motivations was freedom.

So you’re incorrect there again.

Also with chapter 131, his motivations was that he wanted to make the outside world they way he envisioned it as a child not Eldia.

Your project is not happening, I mean you aren’t even paying them and you expect high level drawers to help you… you don’t even understand alot of the story lmao.",io5yu1s,vz9azv,attackontitan,2022-09-12 22:06:47,0,1,,Barjuden,False
Barjuden,SnooRobots281,"Edit: I want to add that I’m separating you and your opinions, I don’t hate you or even dislike you.

No, the plan was to destroy the rest of the world, it so happened that fate made it so that Mikasa in the future would have killed him ( you can’t change the future). 

In chapter 139 he explicitly states that he would have destroyed the rest of the world if the alliance hadn’t come for him. 

The choice Eren gave her wasn’t to end the titans or not, it was to give Eren the founding titan ability or not.

it’s easy to get the beginning part but more so alot of the end part.

The reason why she didn’t end it there was to allow Eren to use the power because he gave her a choice, for the first time in her life.

Also now you’re opposed to the Rumbling even happening but you prefer Aot no requim 🤣

Also again she need Mikasa to kill Eren, to inspire her.

Ok… 

That whole mini rant about Ymir and Mikasa in the middle makes no sense so moving on…

“But it’s more than that, the reality of life beyong the walls was nothing like the world I dreamed about… it was nothing like the world I'd seen in Armins book. When I learned that humanity had survived beyond the walls I was so dissapointed”

Quoted straight from the page… 

he didn’t do it for Eldia, but he did it because he wanted to make the outside world the way he envisioned as a child from Armins book.

He didn’t decide for Mikasa to kill him, it was fate that was completely out of Erens control. Have you ever heard of that concept. 

And again he would have destroyed 100% of the world if the alliance hadn’t come for him

Awnser this… Do you think that Eren would have stopped at 80% of the world if the Alliance agreed with him and stayed in Paradise?

Your misconception filled point… it’s really dumb tbh and shows your lack of understanding yes I exposed that for sure.

His plan is simple… destroy the world outside of Paradise.

I don’t think you’re objectively wrong for not like the ending but you literally think Eren planned to kill 80% of the world 🤣🤣🤣

So yeah you’re still wrong and you’re also childish for saying srew you at the beginning, come with better points next time.",io88b8c,vz9azv,attackontitan,2022-09-13 09:01:51,1,3,io69j8l,Barjuden,False

Appropriate_Type6153,SnooRobots281,"I agree… but with some slight alterations.

1) Dedicate a whole episode to Eren and Armins conversation and expand in the ideas presented (like you said).

2) Dedicate a whole episode to the final 8 pages, with dialogue and context added to what we shown.

Instead of just seeing things with no dialogue, that wouldn’t work especially as a send off for aot.

3) Like they did with chapter 123 & 130, some re-arrangements would be nice.

To somehow show Eren & Armins convo before Eren & Mikasas convo.

I also pray for 12 episodes too, Mappa has been slower when it comes to pacing and that was done for the better. Mappa improved the manga in the anime and I hope they continue it here.

This is a bit controversial:

But I would have Paradise attacking another country instead of Paradise being the one destroyed:

It shows the cycle restarting better than what we actually got… Eldians is the one who started the previous war and it’s Eldians who are gonna start the new war.

Instead of some random nation starting it…

Appropriate_Type6153,PhunkOperator,"> many people want to see an entirely original anime ending, however, I don’t think that’s necessary.

Speak for yourself. Liner x Eren x Connie threesome is very necessary in my eyes.

> Ymir loving fritz being thrown in at the end

This twist fell flat, for lack of a better description. Most people find the idea itself gross. Personally I find it ""unrealistic"", and no, the Stockholm Syndrome explanation doesn't satisfy me either, because that's not actually an accurate interpretation.

But Mappa already had the chance to build it up better in part 2, yet didn't. So if they don't do what you suggest in part 3, then this aspect of the story will probably remain as unsatisfying as it was.

> I also think that Eren and Armin’s conversation should be a whole episode that really takes it’s time and is a bit more thorough than the manga.

This is one possibility. The general problem is that everything about the ending was too rushed, and that Isayama was to cagey in regards to Eren's revelations. For example, considering all the other half-truths he tells Armin, how seriously should we take it when he says that Mikasa was the key to pacifying Ymir? I always thought that was just a massive lie on Eren's part, to hide his own insane intentions. He would've rumbled, Mikasa or no Mikasa. 

> that the pages about Mikasa’s future, and Paradis’s long term future should be expanded upon a bit more. 

Or thrown out entirely, to keep the ending open ended as it originally was. Or have a massive time skip and show just the tree and the kid. Mikasa bringing her entire family to the grave of a monster is just meh without more context.

But the idea of AOE is literally that it's the sequel to the manga, and the final ending that relies upon the manga ending to make sense. 

They stick to the idea that the entire thing revolves around the backlash towards 139 and that we want the anime ""changed"" as if to erase the existence of that chapter within the overall story. 

They mention that most anime industries like to stay faithful and respectful to the author. But they don't acknowledge the idea that the author may be behind the AOE and that to follow that path would be being respectful and faithful to the author.

Also they bring up that the few AO changes made so far are because Isayama wanted it, but somehow don't extend that logic to an AOE.

For a short section they acknowledge the idea that Isayama is ""in on it"" but dismiss it because of the production issues WIT faced, and the fact that they were only signed up to do one season. But it couldn't have been known how successful the anime would have been back then so it would've been unrealistic to make such long term plans. In the case where the anime wasn't a success, the type of narrative AOE theories follow could've just stayed within the manga.

It's not a matter of MAPPA ""throwing out"" the final volume if Isayama and the AoT committee were to have been committed to an AOE before planning for the finale began. And it's not about ""making a fan theory come true"", it's about making what would've been Isayama's vision come true.

They make the assumption that MAPPA has already planned out 139, which it doesn't seem there's any evidence towards. MAPPA wouldn't have to re-do anything.",k2pa02o,16uy38k,AttackOnRetards,2023-09-29 11:48:24,-8,1,,No-Past-4379,False

This one. It holds such an important meaning to her arc. It’s when her arc has finally reached its end and by saying that being a goddess wasn’t so bad, she finally comes to accept who she is as an inherently selfless person (hence the callback to the idea of a ""goddess"" which was used by her to refer to Historia as someone who is ""trying to do good deeds"" but as we know Hisu was faking being an altruistic person and was actually the selfish one while Ymir was the selfless one faking being selfish). She had convinced herself that she wasn’t being true to herself by being selfless because of what happened with the cult, she initially thought it was a position that was placed onto her without her really getting to choose and she blamed her self sacrificing nature for going through this traumatic event, but really it’s by acting selfish that she was being untrue to herself because no matter how hard she tried not to be selfless, she would always help others.",lb3uktv,1ds8y0g,attackontitan,2024-07-01 12:20:06,4,1,,Life_Is_A_Mistry,False

MisplacedxLightbulb,commander_wong,"My complaints kind of extends just beyond the ending itself, but the also leadup to it

A) Eren not regress his character and being ""an idiot"". Like I get what Isayama was going with, but I just don't like it. Ultimately a character with clear goals and motivations is more captivating than characters that don't know what they're doing

B) The Ymir thing. I thought the Ymir characterization was ok. It was kind of clear that she was like that when she protected Fritz from the spear. I thought her regrets on not letting him die and imaginary hugging her daughters was nice, touching even.

What I didn't like was how this was the key to stopping all Titans out of nowhere and for some reason Mikasa was the key to everything despite having very little similarities to Ymir's situation. There was just no setup, didn't make much sense and wasn't a satisfying answer

C) Time paradoxes. As cool as the ""sending visions to the past"" has been in some moments, it ultimately added nothing to the story as a whole. I felt it made a lot of character motivations convoluted when it didn't need to be, and made characters feel like they have no agency over their own actions. Like Grisha making Eren a Titan after begging Zeke to stop him, or Eren sending Dina to eat his mom

D) Alliance motivations. From our POV, it's easy to say ""genocide is wrong"". But from the characters in question, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Outside of Jean and maybe Armin, the rest of Eren's friends aren't exactly altruistic people. I feel Isayama never developed a good reason for why they would go out of their way to stop Eren

E) Characterization changes. On that note, I feel a lot of characters have been made to support stopping the Rumbling when they probably wouldn't. Most of the dead Scouts probably wouldn't mind the Rumbling happening, Erwin included. Kruger especially shouldn't be against the Rumbling. 

I feel Isayama also made the outside world a lot more tolerable as the Rumbling is happening and did the inverse with Paradis citizens, which I felt is doing too much to make the readers/watchers feel bad about what Eren is doing

F) Plot armor. Kind of a minor complaint, but the Alliance members' plot armor in the final battle is just off the charts. Comparing the beginning of the series to what they are doing now feels like two different universes

G) Historia. She did nothing post timeskip. Her parallels to Ymir wasn't important. Her pregnancy, which was brought up quite a bit, didn't really lead anywhere. 

H) Armin x Annie. Also kind of minor, but this is maybe the worst romance I've ever read. Some defenders of this ship will pretend this was ""foreshadowed"" when Annie didn't kill Armin as the Female Titan, which is probably the lowest bar for a romance I've ever heard",k8kaig1,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-09 23:09:51,121,1,,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

He wants freedom for Paradis and his friends, he wants to wipe the rest of the world away, he doesn't want to but he's a slave to the future and the founder, he doesn't know why, he's an idiot... its a bit confusing. Yes some of these overlap and multiple can be true, but I'd simplify it personally. I'd carry over his titan hatred of ""the enemy"" to the outside world and have him refuse to see them as people at first (basically even more of an inverse Gabi). Then as he spends time with more of them (Yelena, Onyonkapon, Zeke, Falco etc) his ability to view them as inhuman enemies gets more difficult which is why he becomes so cold and distant. He basically separates himself from his humanity to avoid thinking about how immoral the rumbling is and how many innocent lives he's taking. Basically have him explain to Armin that he spent so long consumed with the idea of ""killing all of his enemies"", titan and human, that he couldn't let himself come to terms with the shifting morality of his mission. ""If I can just finish the mission I promised to complete years ago the people I care about will be free"".


Also this might be unpopular, but I'd remove the twist of him leading the Dina titan to eat his mother.

If they wanted to do an arc where Erens the villain thats cool but it felt wrong to have that be the end.

Definitely think one of who became the alliance should have been one of the Yeagerists (Cause lets be honest- Flochs an interesting character but we don't care about him like Reiner or Jean) and B. REALLY think ONE, AT LEAST ONE of the alliance members should have died. Jean I think would actually be the best chcouce for both; He has a choice to make- Either join the Yeagerists and live peacefully, or fight with he alliance and risk death. I think if he picks the latter, he should pay the price.

Eren had a several minutes of conversation with Armin where they even talked about it but nothing was clarified properly.

commander_wong,New-Monarchy,"Hijacking the top comment here to add a couple more quick things. I completely agree with you! But I just wanted to add some points that aren’t limited to the finale, but are all still technically towards the “end” of the story:

1. I straight up dislike the “Pride” episode (4x24). I thought that episode was a good opportunity to flesh out both Annie and Connie, and it kinda dropped the ball for both because it needed to rush through so much so fast. It would've worked 1000x better if it was split into two episodes. One for finding and fleshing out Annie/Connie, and one for forming the alliance. I think it’s probably the lowest low for the entire series for me.

2. I would extend the plot armor complaint to the Jeagerist fight by the port too. Not AS bad as the finale fight, but still a little unbelievable given what we’ve seen in battles before.

3. Pacing. Once the actual rumbling starts, the story’s pacing is just too quick. I understand that Isayama was under a lot of pressure to finish up the manga, but there were just so many things that needed more time to flesh out. It started off as nitpicks here and there, but by the time the finale comes, I have legitimate issues with just how QUICKLY some of the plot threads are resolved, on top of the issues listed above and by the comment I’m responding to.",k8kfwv6,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-09 23:44:12,33,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False
commander_wong,random1211312,"I agree with most of this. However I think A was just a bit too subtle in what it was about. Eren's always been a childish and irrational character. That's part of what made his ""switch"" to the stoic badass bitch so shocking. But in reality the act falling apart at the end makes sense. That being said, I do think it would've been better if they hinted at that a bit more and structured it in a more logical way.

I also disagree on C a bit. Again, it could've been handled better, but I do think it adds to things more. My only complaint is that a lot of the actions taken weren't left with enough of a question for it to be anything but ""Woah that's crazy"". For example Grisha killing the Reice family. It's very easy to say he did it for his own reasons. But they added in the Eren bit, which while shocking, and chilling for what Eren's willing to do as well as Zeke's development, added nothing to that moment itself. In fact it would've been more terrifying to see Eren redirecting the smiling titan to his mom instead.

I was so disappointed. I wanted to destroy it all"" and in special 2 (Chapter 139). ""If you guys hadn't stopped me, I would've flattened the world"" or something to that effect.

commander_wong,zbox2345,"Definitely some valid complaints here that I totally get.  I’m sorry for the long reply, and writing isn’t the easiest way to convey my thoughts, but if you care to read this, here you are. 

A) I can see where you’re coming from, but I disagree that Eren was a character without clear goals and motivations. The thing is that he has multiple motivations, some of which inhibit the other goals. This is not uncommon in the real world either. His four mains goals as I see them were 1) Get rid of the Titan curse.   2) See that scenery (create the unoccupied world that he saw in Armin’s book).   3) Protect his friends, and yes, I’m aware Hange and Sasha died as a result of his actions (this is where his other goals inhibit each other) plus, I think that as he saw it, this was the clearest path towards safety, as it was the future he saw in his memories. Fighting a war against the world was too uncertain for his taste. 4) Buy Paradis a reasonable amount of time. Finally, when Eren calls himself an idiot, much like the rest of the dialogue in the series, people take it at face value without applying context or trying to parse his words. I don’t think he’s saying that he’s stupid. He’s saying he’s an idiot in the sense that he couldn’t let go of his childish desire to see the world he wanted to see in Armin’s book. 

B) I don’t feel like there always needs to be an absurd amount of setup for every plot reveal. Sometimes, a plot reveal is meant to take you off guard a bit, but when you think about it, it fits well enough. Others have written good pieces on this https://x.com/cactuzz4nf/status/1721331822158618670?s=46&t=FinmjoOw7kwnyVV30b6joA

C) Frankly, I agree with you here to some degree, especially regarding Eren’s mother twist. As for Grisha, I’ve seen people theorize that Eren showed him other memories later that convinced him to give Eren the Attack Titan. During the conversation with Zeke, it’s clear he didn’t know Carla had died. It’s possible knowledge of her death is what triggered a rage in him that made him give up the Titan to Eren. Ultimately, there are times where a writer chooses to allow some ambiguities that can reasonably be filled in by a viewer for the sake of story pace. That is not the case with Eren’s mom, which is why I dislike it a bit. 


D) I fundamentally disagree here. I think this is one of the most well developed and predictable outcomes of the series. To talk about this, I have to begin with the Jaegirists.  Although I disagree with them, I understand where they’re coming from. To them, the world is a faceless monster that wishes them dead, so why shouldn’t they respond in kind? In contrast, our scouts have crossed the sea, lived with the people across the sea, and have become aware that the outside world is not so different than theirs. Most of the outside world is innocent. As Hange said, they’re no longer ignorant island devils. They can’t just sit back and let Eren trample over people without discrimination. It would be impossible for them to enjoy the “peace”, however brief that “peace” may be, knowing that it was built upon the lives of BILLIONS OF INNOCENTS. They’ve been victims and witnesses of indiscriminate murder, at the hands of pure titans, since the very first season. How can they idly watch as it happens on a planetary scale? I think this is why Onyankapon was so frustrated by the Jaegerists at his execution. He was frustrated that none of them could understand the insanity of indiscriminate murder, despite their own experiences with it since the fall of Shiganshina. 

In the end, it all circles back to dialogue from both Armin and Levi from the first season. When the female Titan is attacking, Levi tells Eren “You can never know for sure what the right choice is in the moment; you have to make the choice you believe you’ll regret the least.” Every character in the alliance, as well as Floch himself are doing just that. 

Armin’s speech about who people perceive as a “good person” applies more to us as an audience. A lot of people can become blinded by emotion or personal investment for one side or the other, which narrows their perspective. So many support the Jaegerists without even trying to understand where the Alliance is coming from. Same goes for blind supporters of the alliance who dismiss every action the Jaegerists take. I think this lack of perspective can hamper someone’s experience. If you’re ridiculously biased toward either side, you may find yourself loving or hating the show for the wrong reasons. To me it’s a harrowing story, where every character involved has been put in an impossible situation where the stakes have never been higher. My own views fall in line with Alliance, so I root for them, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t understand Floch and company. 

E) Again, I think you are misunderstanding the characters. I understand that Erwin is capable of making hard decisions, but that doesn’t mean he’s without any moral fiber at all. His entire goal was to prove that humanity existed outside the walls. Do you honestly believe he’d be down for INDISCRIMINATE global genocide? I honestly don’t think it’s that crazy to think that he would oppose it. As for Kruger, how is him opposing the rumbling unbelievable? He’s from Liberio, which is in the path of it. 

F) Off the chart plot armor seems a little extreme. Can you give some examples? Obviously, their skills improved significantly since season 1, so yes, what they’re doing now will be more impressive. 


G) Parallels can be set up between multiple characters. It doesn’t always have to directly lead somewhere. The point of her pregnancy was plot related. She had to become pregnant to avoid being fed Zeke. Plus, her baby is the first born into a world without titans.

H) This one seems more like a personal gripe. I thought there was sufficient setup. Romantic setup can be subtle; it doesn’t have to be overt. Armin and Annie’s ties have been evident since season one, at least to me.",k8m1kmc,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-10 06:52:46,2,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

commander_wong,Opposite-Constant329,"I respect a lot of these critiques. I hope that I can clear up why I think the Alliances motivations do have good justification. 

One of the biggest things is that everyone in the Alliance besides Levi and Hange spent that night with Ramsi’s family. This group understands better than anyone else in Paradis that there are plenty of people in the world that are either being oppressed by Marley as well, or have nothing to do with the conflict. These guys have bonded with “the enemy” more the anyone else. Especially given the fact that they grew up as soldiers with Reiner, Bert and Annie. One of the big themes of AOT is that it’s easy to assign evil intentions or kill people who you’ve never even tried to sit down and talk to. All of Eren’s friends have experienced dining with the outside world and know that there are people that inarguably don’t deserve to be killed just for living outside the walls. 

I’m not sure if you think that Levi’s motivations are unclear but I feel if anyone lacks justification for helping paradis carry out a genocide it’s Levi Ackerman. Levi grew up oppressed by Paradisians. Not only was he essentially confined to an underground ghetto, but Paradis had actively been carrying out their own genocide that people tend to forget. The Ackerman were systematically being hunted down sponsored by the royal family as they were uncontrollable due to their immunity to the founder. Then Levi is essentially forcibly drafted into their military, and when he eventually turns it into his family, he is regularly spat at by the average paradis citizen when the scouts returned from failed missions. Then after all of this Floch the leader of the Yeagerists attempts to execute him while he was mortally wounded trying to carry out his final mission in killing Zeke.

commander_wong,KittiesOnAcid,"I like the ending thematically, but I agree it's poorly told mostly because of F. The battle on Eren's back against all those powerful titans definitely feels like a completey different world compared to the threat of even a few normal titans in earlier seasons. Suspension of disbelief goes out the window. The pacing is also awful and ramps up way too quick. I kinda think we would've benefitted from knowing more about what's going on with Eren.

Ultimately, idek what to think. The show couldn't always stay the same as it was in Seasons 1-3, and I like the idea of Paradis and Marley. I like where the story goes, Eren's disillusionment with the real world, the reveal of the titans' true origin and the discrimination against Eldians, etc. I like the themes of the end for the most part. But the plot goes way too quickly to Eren being a genocidal maniac, the rest of the cast fighting against completely unbelievable odds, and Mikasa and Armin feeling so good about Eren at the end is a bit weird. It's nice that Armin shoulders a bit of the responsibility but also feels unrealistic to how someone would actually act there. And obviously Armin teaching Eren about the outside world does not even begin to justify Eren's viewpoint. 

It's weird, a bit all over the place, and feels like a different world from the rest of the story. At the same time, I cannot think of any way to do it better other than making it longer to fix pacing and flesh some stuff out.",k986vn9,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-14 17:08:50,1,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

I also thought the decisions at the end weren't in their nature, like in seasons 1 and 2 they were pretty open with eachother and would talk everything through beforehand. In the last season Eren leaves them and is making all these rash decisions, the Islanders want to do the rumbling and defend Eren to do so, and then think it's too far and stop him. Everyone is blaming Erin for Sasha's death even though it was totally unconnected to him in a mission they all signed up for.

KookyAssociate3825,DaRandomRhino,"But that still ignores that the early parts of the series before the timeskip and certainly up to the sea was centered around far more standard tropes that aren't determinism.

The broken gear, Mikasa nearly dying while Eren was full berserk and right before he showed up, etc.

Once determinism is thrown into the mix as late as it was, it hamstrings plot and motivations so much. It's no longer Eren seeing his mother killed, it's a determined event. Once he gets future memories he no longer makes choices, he hits the play button. Him going to Marley in secret to see how they live and treat Eldians doesn't matter, because he was already on autopilot from the moment he touched Historian's hand and that had already happened to him potentially.

The Paths are a great idea, his Titan sending memories backwards neat, his motivation being to see his people and his family free to the exclusion of everything else in his mind, neat. Every single bit of it comes tumbling down as soon as they are introduced together and makes the buildup to it largely meaningless. 

You could start the series near the end and have an actual deterministic story play out convincingly. But the start and end are written with completely different motivations from Isayama. 

It may be because the timeskips just sorta happen. The titans suddenly no longer being a threat in any way, shape, or form to force the threat be Marley, the rest of the world, then ending with Eren in almost no time at all for the audience and their perception of in-universe time being inconsistent.",k8yasvt,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-12 18:41:36,2,3,k8xon4s,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

If Eren can’t affect the story being a powerless omnipresent being, then he has no more agency post founder, no matter if he has wants/desires because they are irrelevant to the the future decisions of the story with this take.

Kuirage,redeclipse619,"What I mean by mystery is that the pregnancy plot intentionally gives vague explanations and raises questions such as who was conspiring with Historia and why she got pregnant which is left unanswered until 130 which is quite frankly not enough to validate Historias actions character wise considering the severity of the rumbling. If instead of leaving these questions unanswered at the end of the story, Isayama undoubtedly could have explored Historias character and psyche, and how she coped with Erens plan which would provide opportunities to better elaborate on Historias state of mind.

Historia as a character is unconditionally benevolent and kind hearted, and always looked out for others. That was her goal, it was what she took pride in. It’s shown over and over again that Historia is considerate and empathetic and this would apply to the outside world as well. She even says herself in chapter 65 that she’d help anyone no matter who and no matter where, and unlike characters such as Floch and Eren,
Historia shows no animosity towards the outside world, and even points out to Eren that the majority of the rumblings victims wouldn’t deserve it, so it’d be a stretch to say that she was only considering the island and not humanity in general. 

Out of all the characters Historia should be among the least likely to support the rumbling because of her kind hearted personality, and she says that’d she would never be able to forgive herself if she supported it. And although it’s true that there was no right answer for her. Both options go against her beliefs, and it’s because of this that she should attempt to carve her own path to try to avoid both options since both options go against everything she stands for. But this never happens. She never tries to find another solution to the problem like the scouts did, she instead chose to immediately comply with Eren despite the severity of the rumbling. It’s not like she tried her best to avoid helping Eren but she only followed through because she had no other choice since she immediately chose to comply with Eren as soon as he revealed his plan, and never attempted to find a different path to help Paradis. Saying that she carved out her own agenda as well isn’t entirely true since she was obeying at worst and allowing/remaining neutral to Erens plans at best despite how much it goes against her beliefs. She didn’t try to find her own path to help Paradis, she followed Erens path.

My opinion though, it felt a little unsatisfying. I wanted to like Eren still and the ending turned him into an unlikeable whiny child. Or rather,  he was always that unlikeable why child and he never changed from birth. All very poetic, good writing. Great use of a default protagonist that should be a dynamic character that goes through growth,  and it seems like Eren grows and changes, but only due to perspective. Once the ending unmasks him we see Eren as the static character he always was. Good writing. 

But still I wanted to root for Eren. I still do. And I find the idea that genocide could be rationalized to be a more compelling idea than just ""never an excuse for war or genocide, Eren bad"".

If ever there is a good excuse for genocide/the rumbling its in a universe where magic exists and the population with that magic will be persecuted and hunted for all time.

Idk I get that I'm wrong. But it just felt like it would have been cooler for Eren to make a compelling philosophical case for his actions rather than just be revealed as a selfish child with a huge gun.",mtd0cer,1krbja6,attackontitan,2025-05-20 22:47:22,2,1,,fear_no_man25,False

Eren isn’t allow himself to be defeated. He wanted to complete the rumbling to 100% but was stopped by the alliance because he was unwilling to take away his friends freedom and power. And taking away their memories in the paths isn’t the same as taking away their freedom, because the message was meant for be viewed after his death. It’s like a loved one recording a video message in the present which is meant to be viewed later in the future

Karl Fritz was a coward, he didn’t want to fight, he didn’t want to do anything, all he wanted to do was live out the rest of his life in a peaceful paradise he created. And getting rid of the Titan powers isn’t as simple as just commanding Ymir to do so. Ymir must be freed for the paths and Titan powers to disappear. Which is why she was only freed by Mikasa at the end of the story. Eren also didn’t erase Ackermans memories, he spoke to them in the present time with their last conversation, as the founders power can’t affect Ackermans

The wall titans aren’t the same as normal pure titans, which is why when Zeke dies they don’t move aimlessly. These titans must be controlled by the founder and Ymir in order for them to move. So Eren dying wouldn’t make the turns act any different to Zekes death, as they would still need the founding titan and Ymir to control them, which they wouldn’t have

You’re overthinking the paths. The paths are used for the sole creation of Titans. The paths were created by Ymir’s will and the Worms power, being the Titan power, therefore would make sense that the only thing that would be transferred to the real world is Titans


I’m not reading all that about the great titans aren’t because it’s literally just a massive block of text, like the rest of your post 🤦‍♂️

kagantamello,Raznuk_Venger42699,"Bad take incoming... First season is so boring at the beginning, worst season of the series (not necessarily bad, but not that good), Eren turns into a giant way too soon, controls his titan form to quick, and it only gets some proper pace in the last 5 episodes.

Second season is the best one by far, incredible outcomes and such outstanding plot twists, (no, Bertholdt and Reiner were spoiled to me but they were no obvios of being titans, it was still a surprise to me), specially with Levi vs Beast Titan, gorgeous fight. .

Third season part 1 is compelling very well executed, Kenny's backstory and the Founding Titan source, specially both Historia's and Eren's development were pretty great, even though it's not as good as the second one (Historia's father turning into a Giant giant titan was kinda lame ngl), still better than the first one.

Then, Third season part 2 which is an absolute masterpiece, second best season in AOT's anime, Eren vs Reiner was so anticipated for me, the way they defeated Bertholdt with that final outcome delivered by Eren since First season was an amazing final touch, or trying to decide between Armin or Erwin was breathtaking, and that cliffhanger is such a banger with Eren's dad reveal about Paradis and Marley, I fucking love it...

And then we have Fourth season, great plot twists, heartbreaking moments, yeah, but Warhammer Titan was such a disappointment, it didn't even last more than one episode, and lost its relevance that it gained a few moments ago, I mean, even the new animation gave me mixed feelings, and never got used to it, splitting it too many times in too many parts was exhausting, at lest the story was keeping us up for the vast majority, but it went downhill with Eren knowing all the past, being able to change his past, alter his own life, but doing absolutely nothing thinking he could not change anything when he could (maybe not but at least try it), then got me again when the formed an alliance against Eren, him being the final villain is a nice touch, but it all was planned by a stupid grown ass kid who did not wanted to Rey and fight against the past, let everybody else getting killed by the titans (how the hell there's a bunch of Colossal Titans when only one exists? How does that even make any sense?), Hange's sacrifice was sad but didn't have any real purpose than getting rid of her, and I wanted more of her dammit, and the final solution was for Mikasa to deliver the final kill and beheading Eren because she was the answer, only God knows which is that, and that's it? I mean, like that? C'mon, the outcome could've been better than that, and still I kinda like it, I simply requiere more context and justification for that final showdown, it doesn't make any sense but I think I understand where Isayama was coming from... And that well executed disappointing endless war that destroyed humanity over and over again... And I'm fine with that, it makes sense with how they've been acting with each other, but at the same time makes Eren's self sacrifice completely in vain and shallow, it served for nothing, leaving it as an open ending that goes to nowhere, and I get it, thematically it works and sounds great, but the execution man, it sucks...

goltaku555,Traditional_Buy_8420,"I think I dropped AoT at S3E20. At the very least I watched S3E11. Had the Anime ended after S2 I still wouldn't put it into my top 10 Animes.

Mostly the pacing was too slow. I remember some action scenes revolving around Levi Ackerman which I liked a lot and he also had the best dialogue, but I'm still not a particularly big fan of him. Overall I didn't like the dialogue in AoT. I tried jap, eng and ger dub and nothing particularly clicked for me. I remember when I first saw a trailer I found the art style interesting, in hindsight I can't tell whether the parts of AoT which I found boring (I can't point any out in particular because they weren't memorable, also it's roughly 3 years ago since I dropped AoT) dulled the art style or to me the style didn't fit the setting, storytelling and pacing in the first place. I think part of it was the mood, like everything is doomed all the time. It's not even like I hate mourning or realistic moods in general, for example in Grimgar the mourning of a lost teammate was done really well and they reacted accordingly. I think it's more that they made proper plans accordingly, so one thing which sullies AoT for me is that so much is so hidden, that it's hard to tell in which direction the plot is going, so then it's harder for me to get invested to it. For example I liked the plans they hedged when when they started suspecting sth. inside the walls and obviously there were going to be twists ahead with that arc and there were and I liked it till there, but then after most of the twists were revealed again sth. seemed to drag along and make the pace slower than it needs to be, one thing is characters who hesitate to do what they must, but there's something else which I can't put my finger onto.

While I didn't drop Grimgar, I wouldn't say it's better than AoT per se. There's other Animes which I liked a lot less than the hype they brought with them, for example One Piece or NGE. Some of the Animes which I enjoyed a lot are Death Note, Kill La Kill, Re:Zero, Stein's Gate, Your Name.",mmvy1f9,1jy59gd,attackontitan,2025-04-13 14:43:07,-7,2,mmvpugc,kagantamello,False

PhantomSteals,VariedJourney,"I don't use hianime, but generally  the order beyond the OADs is meant to be straightforward. But if hianime is being weird about it, here's perhaps why: Attack on Titan's last season was released in parts, and the final chapter is likely referring to the last two episodes (referred to as specials) of the show.

The way the final chapter of AoT was released was as a special of two episodes, known as the final chapter or 'specials'. They are referred to as specials sometimes because the two episodes are both hour-long episodes and are the final part to season 4. They are also sometimes referred to as part 3, from what I can tell.

For some reason it seems they're offering you multiple.. options for watching the last part/specials of the season? ..I still wouldn't worry, because either way you're gonna end up watching in order - just be safe and watch part 2, then part 3, and then 'final chapters'. They may have separated the seasons out more than they usually are, but certainly the final chapters are referring to what the final episodes/specials are called.

It definitely shouldn't be complicated - if you're able to watch AoT somewhere else it might make things easier, 'cause most places just keep it simple. 'Season 4, episode \[blahblah\]' throughout.

The black and white pictures are fun, sometimes references to other things, a couple have stories, but you could probably look at those online another time - they're not mandatory.

Yes and *despite* this she still chose to *kill* him. Which is what Ymir could not do. And the significance of that choice is reinforced by the vision of Ymir clutching her 3 daughters instead of saving Fritz from the spear.

* Aaron then proceeds to destroy everything and then goes back in time to do it all again just to see them suffer. 😈

\-along his fed-up journey he tells all of his friends what's gonna happen just to wipe there memory. Even though some of them have the same hate boner.

\-aaron attempts to save his friends from the Paradis people (even though the plan is the dumbest and most non logical thing ever like I mean EVERY).

\-but Aaron knowing that there's ""no way"" to be with Mikasa (even though literally he has the founding Titan) makes her simp for him so much that she makes out with a decapitated Aaron. YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT SHE MAKES OUT WITH A CORPSE. and then this is the funny part. He makes her stay single just because he's a creep.

* Aaron's ""plan"" some how works and they (some how) live ""happily"" ever after.
* but wait they still need to deal with some important stuff like AARON'S DEATH CULT and mind you that AARON TOKE ALL OF THERE TITAN POWERS SO THERE JUST REGULAR ASS HUMANS. AND ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW AND WHY AARON JUST DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE TITAN POWERS FROM THAT HORNY WOMAN. NO FU DEAL WITH IT.

It would have been interesting to see that instead of Yelena turning the tables on Pixis, it's Rico who surprises him by having the guards guarding their room turn their guns on him and take him prisoner.

With Lobov leaving the Garrison, that would leave a vaccum in the structure of the branch and having Rico fill that spot by gaining a promotion to further cement herself as a spy for the Yeagerists would serve as a real punch in the gut for pixis and Hange when the eventual reveal comes around.

rephosolif,jubbedidubdub,"I think it‘s one of his bigger characteristics his lack of showing any emotions. He feels them, he loves his friends in his own weird way but he‘s just not able to show that or talk about it. He dies for his beloved ones he kills for them but he can‘t say that he loves them. Also he becomes angrier and angrier and this emotion actually can overshadow EVERYTHING you feel. For Eren this is the case. He becomes more of an depression angry shell of a human as the season goes on. The moment when he cries for the first time you talk about. I think about it that his shell finally cracks open as it‘s now to late and he can’t change it anymore and he knows they will all remember what he told them when he‘s dead. Also he only cried in Armins memory, what shows how much he trusted Armin to see him as who he really is and who he actually wanted to be.

shinobi_4739,Shani_Jeizan,"For some reason, I never expected a story like Attack on Titan to give Marco such an important role. He died pretty early on, and even though he was their friend, we barely knew anything about him. So when the characters were acting completely devastated over his death, I struggled to understand because I never really felt that strong of a connection to him. The same goes for when Eren was so shocked to learn that Annie was the Female Titan,I mean, she was always distant and cold toward him. Out of everyone, she should have been the most obvious suspect, though ironically, I never suspected her at all.

But back to Marco. He died in an environment where, as painful as it is, death is common. Of course, his friends would have been sad, but they would have eventually moved on and thatrs exactly what they seemed to do in the first three seasons. Then suddenly, in season 4, Marco is brought up again, and we are told that his death deeply affected Jean. But for three whole seasons, Jean seemed more concerned about the people dying right in front of him, and he never even mentioned Marco.

Also, something that always bothered me, how did Yelena even know about Marco? Was she close to Reiner and Bertholdt, and they told her? Probably not Bertholdt, since seasons 1 to 3 take place over just a few months, so I doubt they had even met her back then. So why was she, of all people, the one to bring him up?

And then there Is Jean‘s reaction. He is so devastated about Marco that he brutally beats Reiner, yet he is suddenly indifferent toward Annie? That never made much sense to me.

Overall, I think Jean’s moment of regression was too short and too easily resolved. If he changed his mind that quickly, was it ever really that difficult of a choice for him in the first place? I feel like his hesitation should have been established much earlier, maybe at the start of the revolt, so we could see that this internal conflict had been brewing for a while. That way, when he struggles with it later on, it would feel more natural, like yeah, this has always been a part of him. But maybe I am just overthinking it.

I also just really wanted him to become the leader he was set up to be in some way. In the end, Armin became commander, and Levi was the one actually directing everyone. I liked Jean a lot, so it feels like something was missing. But maybe I was just expecting too much? I didn’t even think about all these things before the ending, maybe I just took Attack on Titan for granted.",maxynrc,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-04 17:18:19,0,2,max1zrq,Shani_Jeizan,True

> Eren could control all titans from the start but that doesn't really make any logical sense to me. 

Another option is that there's something special about Dina that makes him able to control her. And there is: She's a titan of royal blood, and touched him while he had the founding titan. After attaining full FT powers and starting the rumbling, Eren could have gone back in his own memories to the day that he touched Dina, then from there enter Dina's titan memories of the day Wall Maria fell and controlled her from within that memory. He can't do it with any random titan throughout history, as he was never in contact with another royal titan when he had FT powers (except Zeke, I guess).",k9i5n42,17wne72,attackontitan,2023-11-16 15:26:25,2,1,,forevericeland,False

Obviously Mikasa would be around but I really think it'll be due to Armin's speech, that he will ultimately stops. Armin is so compared to Erwin (even through Armin's own judgement) that I think that's where it'll be shown that he was the choice to make for humanity's sake. I feel like Eren will die, or something more spiritual will happen to him through the path, not entirely sure what yet but I think it'll have something to do with this universe's time flow through the paths. And ultimately, I think the big ending is that the titan's curse will be lifted, Ymir will be free, every Eldians will be ""free"" (hopefully completely in societal terms) and will move onto the continent (basing this last bit on the last anime ending). That's the only end I can possibly imagine. Unless nobody can talk Eren out of it and all is destroyed, but I don't think it's gonna go that way. But it'll be bittersweet at best...!<

1. Eren fails to kill everyone before he himself gets killed
2. All of Eren's friends hate him for what he has done, but they understand why he did it (they kinda just avoid talking positively or negatively about him)
3. Eldia somehow manages to make peace with the remainder of the world sometime after the Rumbling, and this peace is shown to last till the AoT universe progresses to modern technology (what happens after that is left open for interpretation) (as you can see, I am a bit of an idealist with this sort of stuff, though I am aware that world peace for 100 years would be unrealistic)

Every new fan to the series post the finale will watch the entire show before ever being exposed to AoE theories and won't be anywhere near as invested. Old fans will move on and these communities will shrink but I doubt they will ever go away entirely.

What I really want to see is what happens to Titanfolk once the ending is faithfully adapted and it's well received by the Anime Onlies. Even better, what if the adaptation properly contextualizes everything without changing the story. The foundation of much of the criticisms depend on misinterpretations of crucial dialogue to deliberately misrepresent the story.

To think that something as good as AOT could get infinitely better with only a single episode is absolutely amazing. Most plot twists are written to where when they are actually revealed, it’s already been dragged out for so long, or—it was too minimal to be a compelling twist. 

Aot took it to the maximum, with just the right amount of everything. Aot, for people who haven’t explored it’s extremities to it’s fullest, may seem like your slightly above average shonen anime, but after you explore EVERYTHING it has in store for you, it’s easily one of the best crated stories in the anime industry, dare I say in any series to air.",ivo6g9l,yqfqpv,attackontitan,2022-11-09 12:45:32,6,1,,MasterHavik,False

AshiraLAdonai,Grif_the_Crit,"Depends on if you meant when it was released in general. You likely mean when the anime first aired in Japan, which I likely was busy studying about leprechaun lore and playing with paper cut outs of leprechauns.

However, I do have a pretty impactful memory from first seeing the teaser of it on Toonami I believe earlier in the week before its release on it. I may have only been around 9.5 years old but even then I knew this show would have a massive impact in not just shows but culture as well, even if I wasn't entirely obvious of such then.

After some research, I believe the date was May 1st of 2014, due to several reasons:

* The teaser I saw seemed to have been of the Toonami teaser of it, as, while my memory isn't perfect, the imagery and movements seem to be akin to how I saw them first .
* It was around when *The Cleveland Show*'s ""A Cleveland Brown Christmas"" aired around, I believe, between 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM, which was confirmed to be around 9:30 PM, though the teaser was either showed several times before and/or after that.
* The fore mention episode aired in a particular time: not only was it almost summer but it was also nearing the end of the school year, though it was a school night, I believe.

I was at one of my mom's friend's place, which had a pool we used a lot earlier so I was the only one up at the time, though I was both getting tired and bored watching the TV at the time. Then, it happened: I saw the *AOT* teaser.

Now, I had already known anime existed at the time, though I didn't know much and the only anime I had watched were some episodes of *DBZ* (The episodes that had Video vs Spopovichi, and when Gohan was about to fight but was ganged up on), the first episode of *Naruto Shipuden* and some of the *Pokemon* anime; other than that, I did not know much about the genre. *Attack on Titan* seemed... different, to say the least, from other shows, even for an anime; much darker yet had a profound feel to it.

I was shocked with how brutal it was being presented, it being a teaser and all. There was so much more gore and death than I had seen done in any other animated movie or show before. Most importantly, though, were the feelings I felt that I didn't feel from other shows. I felt a sense of dread, as if I knew there was no other option but death there, yet that also gave a sense of... moving forward, I suppose is the best way I could put it; it felt there was some room to move, rather than inevitable suffocation and being crushed by instant death. Looking back, I think I know why: there was some possibility of survival, faint and clouded by death but still a sight for freedom beyond it. I felt the desperate screaming of raw human emotion, fear but also determination. I could see Eren's rage and fight against such alien concepts. It felt... real, or rather the harsh reality of the world.

I didn't consciously think most of these then, but I remember my emotions and I can tell why I felt them, as well as some of my thoughts. What I did consciously think then, however, was that this would change media as a whole; it wouldn't just change what shows and animation could accomplish and be shown, but, in a way, society as a whole through our minds.

I didn't see any reference of it again until 3 years later at a summer camp, with one of the other cabin mates brining a volume with them. I saw and remembered the alien feelings I felt then, with the strange movements and poses of the giant, naked titans, and the brutality of death shown by not just how one was eaten but the fear and helplessness shown when being eaten.

It is safe to say it is living forever in my mind.",mnfky2o,1k0kibx,attackontitan,2025-04-16 18:24:30,1,1,,AshiraLAdonai,False

Z-D4wg,mutDD,"I haven’t read the manga

So I didn’t read ur post cuz I don’t wanna get spoiled haha. I think it’s honestly pretty simple. Aot is a STORY. With every character having their own unique motivations for doing what they do. That’s why there are no TRUE villains. There are no BAD characters. Every character is relevant to the story. 

It’s really a philosophical war. That’s why I think it’s the best anime ever made. I don’t watch anime for the action and stuff like that (even tho it’s appreciated), but for the deep meanings, symbolisms, emotions, etc. 

So I’m simply seeing aot as a story. For example, I DO think that Marley is in the wrong. I mean… in reality, king fritz was wrong of course but that’s already happened. BUT… important BUT… I don’t blame Marley. I don’t think of Marleyens as evil. Again, it’s a STORY with everyone having their own unique motivations and intentions. Imo, Marley should have broken the cycle of hate and revenge. That would’ve been the best solution. But… it is what it is… that’s just not how the story is unfolding.

I'm not even joking when I say this, Isayama literally let a sexual fetish get in the way of an ending that leaves fans happy, AKA, he has a cuckold fetish and admitted that he let it interfere with the ending, infact, thats why you see Jean in the ending. We were rooting for him. But then the Manga ended just the same and it had us heartbroken. Eren Yeager, a character that I had been rooting for since I was eleven years old died in a wholly uncharacteristic way. The ending was completely botched and I gave up on the series. Then I saw Season 4 release and started paying attention, if only to see the Anime Onlies rage just as I had. Then it got split up and I slowly backed out until I saw Satal and the rest of the crew. they all got me to hope that Yama was a genius and that the anime would end differently just as MuvLuv did. And then Cour 2 happened and I was pissed. He knew the reaction to the ending was bad, but went through with it anyway? It makes no sense to me, so much so that I can only chalk it up to Japanese Stubbornness. 

Cour 2 was action packed and absolutely phenomenal save those final twenty minutes. If they had ended the story at the Fall of the Walls then I feel that it would've been the best spot to end it. Maybe come back with a What If? side story with the Alliance banding together to stop the Rumbling but otherwise?

Was it the many lucky things that happened:

- Falco being the only know titan shifter with functional wings, and him knowing how to use them with perfection + being able to shift multiple times without seeming fatigue?

- Armin being captured, not insta killed by Ymir even though we know she wanted to destroy humanity and killing Armin would guarantee that? 

-Armin being sent to the Paths for reasons… to connect with Zeke to resurrect the past titan shifters?

Was it the squandered pay offs:

-The conflict never ends being a terrible way to sign off the show, teasing a new start to the titan powers and showing the infinite birth and rebirth of paradis

-The honorary marleyans reuniting with Annie, Reiner, Gabi and Falco to be ruined by them turning into pure titans (which by the way, was totally inconsequential because they reverted back to human almost minutes later with no detriment) 

-Was it the Commander of Fort Slava saying he’ll never treat Eldians with unjust hatred, only to them begin to perpetuate that hatred again after they revert back to humans? 

- Was it Zeke being killed off by Levi despite having realised his errors of killing so many people? Wouldn’t it have been so much more rewarding and interesting if he decided to help humanity because he wants to cherish life after his conversation with Armin? 

Was it the stupid decisions of the characters:

-Why did Eren kill 80% of the world’s populations? To prevent revolt? 

Congratulations, the Jaegeriists are now the most powerful military force on the planet and will continue to kill everyone outside of Paradis.

Why 80%? Why not 20/10/1? That would’ve been enough to showcase the power of the titans. 

- Why did Eren kill his own mother? To save bertholdt so Armin can get the colossal? Why not just send it away m, turn it around and save his mum? That would’ve worked 

-Eren can go into the past and change the future seemingly. So why the fuck would he not cut it off at the source? Why go through the measures to commit mass genocide? 

Was it the many things that make absolutely 0 sense:

- How did Mikasa know Eren was in the Titans mouth? 

-How can Eren turn into a colossal titan after being separated from the parasite, if that’s the founder? Or is Ymir the founder? Fuck knows 

-Mikasa being chosen to end the cycle of hatred because of love for Eren, like Ymir loved Fritz? What? That’s loose and doesn’t hold 

-Why choose Mikasa after 2000 years to free her from her love from Fritz? Why? How? 

-Why did Ymir allow the reawakening of the past titan shifter? 

-Rumbling stops because Zeke dies, Eren loses contact with royal blood. But what about S2? Eren touches Dina’s hand for a split second and he can control titans for long after that?

-What happened to the parasite thing after Eren dies? You never see it again? 

-The absolute clusterfuck of death baiting.

I thought the ending was great and I really appreciate how it stayed dark. I enjoyed that there wasn’t this Eureka moment to essentially cause a Naruto/Pain moment where all the damage is reversed.

If it was 1 for 1 it would be a code, not a different language. If you translate anything more than a couple words long you are almost guaranteed to have different translators provide different translations.

Translations are so very frequently riddled with errors. They don't ""have the most time to fix"" things. They have the chance to fuck it up.

The translation of anything is NEVER the ""official"" version. The only thing that could ever be the official version is something that is written and checked by the original author in a language they understand and are extremely fluent in. 

I cannot stress this enough. Translations are filled with errors. I don't know where you got the perception that you can trust the translations more than the originals. Because the reality is the exact opposite.

Shows NEVER ""fix"" things in a translation. They don't change story points intentionally for translations. They don't intentionally change what people say based on which language of release.

- The purple flowers are used in promoting merchandise for Mikasa.
- Purple flowers (Saintpaulias in this case) appear in Muv-Luv (the series that inspired Isayama to make AOT). Muv-Luv mentions in floriography Saintpaulias mean "" a delicate love.""
- Yuki Kaji mentioned bellflowers (Hananira) symbolise ""a sad farewell and enduring love"".
- The flowers appear only in scenes where Mikasa and Eren are present. In this scene Eren defends Mikasa by transforming.
- Kaji then mentions the date the flowers were founded..... which was February 10th. The same date as Mikasa's birthday.

Going over the whole scene, he spawns spikes, Porco slices them immediately, he spawns spikes again and actually impales Reiner and Porco (this is the only time he uses them successfully), both shifters get themselves off pretty quick, he tries to get Porco with spikes again and fails, then Reiner impales Eren with his own spike and Zeke shows up.

I'll try to reword my point about the jail scene. I'm glad he used the Warhammer there, I defnitely agree that it's cooler than him just being let out by Jeagerists.

My main changes would be to take out Eren killing his mom (total BS and betrayal, not even going to rework it), and to rework founder Ymir's motivations and resolution—which would also entail giving Historia a real role in the story again, changing the nature of the worm, etc. Also (speaking of Historia) I felt killing off Ymir Freckles so soon, and in that manner, was a waste and a disservice to her character; that's really the only major pre-timeskip change I would make, though I haven't thought out all the details on how I would do it (and frankly I don't think I care enough about the story anymore to work that out completely).",k7vrfm6,17njuxw,titanfolk,2023-11-05 04:20:45,2,1,,Bayro1997,False
Bayro1997,ABuddhistMelomaniac,"I would've done two different things for the ending, in fact, I always thought this was how it was gonna end:


1 -Eren accidentally kills everyone (except Armin). He also kills Mikasa in, probably, one of the most ironic and shocking ways possible: by accidentally having Mikasa's scarf (the scarf that Eren gave her and symbolizes her love for him) getting stucked on one of Eren's titan's bony arms (or fingers), choking her or breaking her neck as a consequence. THIS (killing everybody and Mikasa) could've been one of the memories he saw when he kissed Historia and the one thing he wanted to prevent, THAT'S WHY he wanted Mikasa to hate him, so that she would abandon the scarf and PREVENT HER BRUTAL DEATH. That would give Eren's confrontation with Armin and Mikasa (the part where he says he hates her) A LOT MORE PURPOSE and meaning, same with Eren's conversation with Louise telling her to get rid of it (which backfires as Louise ideolizes Mikasa and decides to keep it, making it come back to Mikasa). It always got my attention how the scarf would somehow always return to Mikasa, as if everything was a sick play (as in theatrical play) of fate itself.

2 - This event creates dread, pain and a lot of suffering for both Armin and Eren. Eren decides to send his memories (a scene we haven't even been shown but we know that he did) to other titan shifters, especially Karl Fritz, another attack titan user, Grisha, Falco, and his (Eren's) past self, but not with the intend to fulfill his fate, but to STOP him from even being born. He first sends his memories to Karl Fritz, who goes mad and misinterpets Eren's memories as a divine warning, he misinterpets Eren's and Zeke's titans as ""Devils of the Earth"" and Historia as ""Christa""/Ymir, giving rise to the myth of the Devil of the Earth. He sees these ""devils"" fighting for the Founding Titan to destroy the Earth (but he doesn't see how it's gonna be destroyed). He does see the colossal titans and people migraring to an island in Eren's memories but misinterprets them as a way to prevent the devils (Eren and Zeke) from finding the founder: that being by selling half of the Eldians to Marley, exiling himself to Paradis, creating the walls with the colossals (so that the ""devils of the Earth"" would never find it) and creating the ""Cult of the Walls"". The people from Marely, however, noticed his strange change in personality and decide to capture Karl Fritz (before devising his plan of course) and torture him so that he would reveal what he knows (Marely would be destroyed in 1000 years). This also prompts Marely to request Karl Fritz and Tybur's aid during the Titanomachy, contributing to the capture of all the other titans except the Attack Titan (as he was hiding) in exchange for his liberty. I took inspiration from Greek mythology. You see, in Greek mythology we have the Titans and the Olympian Gods. Among them, you have the titan prometheus and the God Zeus. These are enemies, however, Prometheus (Karl Fritz) helps Zeus (Marely) to win their Titanomachy only if Zeus spared his life, making him (Prometheus) betray his titan brothers by putting them against one another. Prometheus (same as Karl Fritz) also can see into the future (his name literally means ""forethought"") and he sees Zeus' own downfall and how one of his children dethrones him. Zeus captures and tortures him until he tells him who is the one child who would dethrone him, making Zeus also go after his own children to murder them, except for one child he didn't even know he had (which, as expected, was the one who would dethrone him).

That's right baby, Eren sends his memories to Karl Fritz to prevent his own birth, but by doing that, Karl created the conditions (the segregation of Eldians, Paradis and the walls) that brought both Zeke and Eren to life (as well as their motivations). Also, having Karl Fritz seeing Eren's memories would explain where the legend of the world leaders fighting a common powerful enemy (the one told by Pixie) came from, as well as Uri and Frieda knowing about judgement day (cause they receive the memories from their ancestor Karl Fritz, which he got FROM THE FUTURE/EREN). This would also explain WHY they (Mareley and his troops) waited for ONE THOUSAND years before attacking Paradis island and retrieve the founder, cause they knew about their imminent doom and had a better understanding of Karl's ""prophetic"" warning.

Eren also sends his memories to his past self (episode 1), explaing the reason why past Eren wakes up crying but doesn't remember what he saw (Mikasa and friends' deaths, which are actually shown in the anime, but it never amounted to anything).

Bayro1997,shrekman68,"Addressing your 15th problem, eren's didn't have to be said for probably the hundredth time in the story. If people expected something else, their expectations ruined their perception of the ending. 

My interpretation of the Ymir and Mikasa situation is that Ymir was a slave. She has never experienced receiving or  conveying true love. She yearned to experience love, but it wasn't really the case with King Fritz. When she saw Mikasa let go of Eren and her love for him, it showed that Ymir could do the same. The scene showing Ymir hugging her daughters instead of sacrificing her life to save King Fritz shows how she truly loved her daughters and descendants, leading to her erasing the titans.

My memory is a little foggy, but Eren said that the past, future, and present existed at the same time for him. I don't think it's a stretch for him to be able to control pure titans from the past.

The ""Ten years at least"" scene may have been jarring, but given the situation, I would say it's appropriate for Eren to be acting like that. He was holding in his emotions for so long, only to finally be able to let it all out in the presence of his best friend moments away from his death.

Everyone being emotional afterward shows how big empathy as a theme is in the story. That's also why everyone accepted reiner. They still considered him a friend and understood him enough to be emotional about his death.

The ending wasn't pointless just because Beren was hinted to have started the titan curse again. That's the point of the story. It hints to even more conflict occurring in the future, that along with the bombing of paradis. I doubt there will be a sequel. This scene just shows how the nature of humanity never changes.",k7wf3qt,17njuxw,titanfolk,2023-11-05 08:39:18,1,1,,Bayro1997,False

ClarityInMadness,br1nsk,"Yeah but ultimately these are mostly all nitpicks and not major issue, they are far less divisive. 

1- Plot armour is extremely common in anime and manga these days, and frankly the main cast of AoT has always had some. It does get stretched quite far in the finale which has always personally annoyed me but it also isn’t outside the bounds of reason for these characters. 

2- Never understood this subs issue with the necrokiss. Not only is it an incredibly common trend in media for characters to kiss their dead loved ones, it’s also quite common in real life. Certainly isn’t the disgusting thing people make it out to be. 

3- The source of all living matter is an actual glaring issue that definitely takes away from the ending, but ultimately it wasn’t essential to the narrative. It being kind of ignored at the end is mainly just dissatisfying. 

4- Again, nitpick. I don’t love this moment either but it lasts about 5 seconds. It’s a joke at the expense of Reiner’s character, but a joke nonetheless and isn’t meant to be taken that seriously. 

5- I did not like this either, one of my biggest problems with the ending is that besides Hange the alliance took no major casualties, and the final battle against tens of the strongest titans in history actually went absurdly well for them. Transforming everyone to Titans was done for shock value, but it is instantly diminished by them all turning back straight away. Imo either Connie or Jean should have died. Or both. 

6- Minor issue. Obviously not great Isayama didn’t explain this, but also people have an incredibly bad  faith interpretation of it here. She obviously didn’t swim across, she waited with the alliance and went back with them. She walks off at the end because she probably wants a moment alone. I also doubt Eren’s decapitated head is rotting with her the whole time, it was probably turned into a skull or something. 

Anyway my point is that those are all not huge issues that ruin the ending. If you were happy with how Eren’s character resolved, but all of this still happened, I promise you wouldn’t still be here 2 years later complaining about the ending.",k81lhov,17obtdy,titanfolk,2023-11-06 08:55:52,2,3,k7zpr83,ClarityInMadness,False
ClarityInMadness,br1nsk,"What’s become abundantly clear to me, and what should have been clear a while ago, is that the way you perceive the ending is completely dependent on how you perceive Eren. 

Most people on this sub don’t buy the idea that he had no idea what he was doing the whole time, and that the way he acts in the end is a mischaracterisation of him. I think this is a fair critique. 

However, if you simply take the story at face value, the way he’s characterised is a lot easier to stomach. Whilst the ending has other issues, whether you’ll enjoy it or not is solely based on how you feel about how Eren is handled. Everything else that happens in the ending isn’t too bad, and imo is pretty decent. If you viewed Eren as someone who never changed before this, then the ending makes sense. The problem is that a lot of people were under the impression he DID change, and that makes the choices with his character confusing and frustrating. 

Additionally, the final episode is a lot better than the final chapter. If you ignore story and just judge it on production value, it’s a great episode. Great animation, great voice acting, and great music. They even got Linked Horizon back. It’s a very enjoyable episode for those reasons alone. Plus the minor story and dialogue changes were good. 

Ultimately the reaction isn’t very surprising. Titanfolk has always been a bit of an echo chamber, as most subreddits are, so it’s easy to forget that a lot of people do not share the issues we have with the ending. I think in time people will be a bit more harsh on the conclusion, as people spend more time analysing the story as a whole.

pixel_139,Independent-Couple87,"Considering he likes Watchmen, it is possible he took inspiration from there for the ending. 

Like Eren, Ozymandias brought World Peace with mass murder. The heroes tried to stop him, but all except for Rorschach agree to help him keep the secret for the greater good. Rorschach is killed to prevent him from telling the public (though it is implied he might have already by sending his diary to a newspaper). 

Doctor Manhattan later points out that ""Nothing ever ends"", that the peace Ozymandias built will not last forever (even if Rorschach was unsuccessful at leaking the plot). The name Ozymandias comes from a poem about the Pharaoh Ramesses II, whom ruled a powerful kingdom in Egypt that ultimately fell with the passage of time. 

Similarly, I think the ending of Attack on Titan was meant to have a similar meaning. That the word peace, regardless of if ti came by Diplomacy or Genocide,  will be temporary. War WILL return to Paradis. 

If the problem was the romance between Eren and Mikasa, that could have another explanation. Isayama once said on an interview that he disliked the Childhood Friend Romance trope.

Conqueringrule,NationalSea9072,"Ending defender here. I disagree with most of these and I would like to explain why. Hear me out at least, because I don't want my time spent writing this to be wasted.
First, Mikasa returning with Eren's head is, I agree, somewhat of an issue. It's not necessarily impossible, as Fort Salta is relatively close to the African coast. Any boats there should be available, and Mikasa would have the ability to commandeer one. I do think Isayama didn't fully consider how it would be possible though.
Second, Saying that the final battle has absurd plot armor is completely missing the point of it. Eren only went through with the rumbling because he thought it would be what's best to protect his friends. He does care for the island of Paradis, but they are an afterthought compared to his core friend group. As he states on the train scene, he cares for them more than anyone in the world. He even refuses to allow any of them to inherit his titan, even if it would be best for someone familiar with Eren to inherit it. 
Of course, he does make sacrifices to get further. Hange dies, which he expresses guilt for, but he is never as close to her as the rest.
If he killed any of his close friends in the rumbling, what would be the point of it? He would be alone in the trampled world. If you wanted a mist-type ending, that's a matter of personal opinion. It was not Isayama's intention and wouldn't have worked in the story as it was written.
Onto the main points:
1. We don't know if it is Jean. That's on purpose, it's supposed to be up to interpretation.
2. Falco is unique. As far as we know, no other pure made by Zeke's spinal fluid has eaten a shifter. Annie has consumed some part of each shifter (perhaps their spinal fluid), but that's different than an initial transformation entirely from the beast. It is convenient for the plot, but I see no reason to think it's completely impossible. Marley was still actively researching titan shifting because of how much they didn't know. Applying arbitrary rules based on what little the reader has seen is not a reason to assume a plot hole. 
Falco probably flies about 2300 miles based on the location of the Azumabito base and Fort Salta. While that's a large distance for a normal titan, birds can travel much further than any other animal. Some can travel 7,000 miles without stopping. Considering that he was flying along the trade winds, it's completely possible.
He's not particularly powerful in any way, either. He would be terrible at attacking other Titans because they could grab and pin him to the ground. His wings would be atrocious in physical combat. He is used as, and is good as, a moving base. He does not outpace Zeke in combat in any way.
At the very least, Falco's titan wasn't a last-minute addition. It is probably the most foreshadowed titan in the series. 
3. Assigning limits to time travel is stupid because time travel destroys a timeline no matter what. Everything in the AOT universe is a bootstrap paradox, and the Dina twist doesn't change that. Also, her promise never made sense. For being so focused on how everything in the ending should logically happen, it doesn't make sense to care about Dina's promise. Even if she does have a special connection to Grisha to seek him out, Eren isn't Grisha. We see no evidence that Eldians genetically share space in paths - which would have to be the case for Dina to find Eren when seeking Grisha. Dina finding Eren consistently is a ""convenience"" for the plot, but it creates an extraordinarily poignant situation during Scream and Carla's death, which helps create the most important moments of the story. It's not like coincidences don't happen in real-life either.
4. Ymir's connection with Mikasa is completely logical. Her impossible romance to Eren mirrors Ymir's impossible romance with Fritz. Whether or not you like Ymir's secret love, her connection with Mikasa is objectively real. Eren's death at the hands of Mikasa is what defines the ending, and that's also what defines Ymir's reason for moving on. It's not like it makes Eren unimportant, because he's still half of the romantic situation. His entire life was leading to that moment, too, even if he wasn't the one to take the final action. This has also been a theme of the story, hammered upon in Bystander.
5. Ackermann memory manipulation is (as far as we know) due to a deal between the royal family and the Ackermann house. While the Royal family is prohibited from manipulating their memories, we don't have evidence to suggest the same limit applies to Ymir - it seems more likely that she is all powerful over her subjects.
The Azumabito/Mikasa plotline is not pointless. It provides the Azumabito with another motivation to come to Paradis. It isn't capitalized on because of the rumbling, but it does matter.
6. We have no reason to think that Frieda would be good in combat. She was young, and she probably never trained. She did use harmless memory manipulation, but that's completely different than fighting. Did you forget about the vow renouncing war?
I don't think there really is major plot armor in the port battle. The main cast are by far the best and most experienced warriors on the planet fighting mostly recruits. On top of that, nearly half of them are shifters.
7. This one is definitely a problem. While it's possible Isayama had reasoning, I think it's just as likely that it was an oversight. That said, it doesn't really matter. The rumbling stopping doesn't have much impact on the rest of the fight.
8. Saying without doubt that Kruger would support the rumbling is illogical. We know barely anything about Kruger or his background. What we do know is scattered. He is a hardcore patriot, but he's also human. There's little reason to think he would want to commit genocide against all nations (because Marely is a small piece of the global rumbling).
10. This whole post about Armin is terrible for numerous reasons. Armin retains his intelligence. He is largely responsible for the enormously successful raid on Liberio. His plan to nuke the founding titan is also decent considering how much they didn't know. What else could he have come up with given their situation?
11. There is no reason to think that Wall titans are just giant pure titans. That's completely illogical. If they were, it would've started moving immediately to attack Mikasa when it saw her. Obviously, they're completely subservient titans who will only move when commanded. Coving them from sunlight would make sense from Nick's perspective too. Nick doesn't know everything about the titans, but he would likely know that they need sunlight. It is logical for him to be worried about the sun waking them up, even if it realistically wouldn't. Covering them also stops the titans from being seen, which Nick wants anyway.
13. There was no Historia character assassination - she just settled down. That's normal human behavior.
14. Assuming that the wall titan reveal invalidates the entire alliance plan makes no sense. The plan was fine and there was literally no other option for them.
15. The founding titan has absolute power. That effectively invalidates all specific other abilities, but it doesn't make the Warhammer useless. The Warhammer's ability is the only reason Eren can break out of prison without being crushed. It is needed for the ending to happen.
16. Eren and Mikasa's relationship (or lack thereof) is one of Isayama's admitted regrets. He regrets them not kissing at Scream and having a more obvious relationship. I agree as well that it should've been shown better. That's not to say it was a retcon though, as we know it was planned since then. It is definitely foreshadowed in Marley, when he asks her ""what am I to you"", and it is foreshadowed when he asks Zeke about it, and they have a conversation about their relationship.
Comparing it to Casca and Griffith is also pointless because they are different series. Isayama compares Mikasa's direct attributes to Casca, not her relationships.

Conqueringrule,Ok_Celebration9304,"My eyes hurt from focusing too hard so I only read up to the point of Reiner and Eren's parallels. You bring up lots of good points,  though. I personally was sort of put off by the Reiner and Eren rivalry and how s4 turned to be Eren doing what Reiner did to him for revenge. It's not a bad idea but I feel like there are better contenders to act as the ""villains"" and enemies of Eren after the reveal about the outside world. The people who are in higher positions and more in control, who controlled and sent Reiner there in the first place. Like the Tyburs who could've been expanded on more. But I understand the logic of why it was written this way to flip the narrative on Reiner and stuff. It's just feels weird and wrong that the enemy was Reiner all along or something and Eren wants to take his revenge starting with him. Something's missing but I can't put my finger on it.


Also, I really agree about the church in s2. They hyped me up to the reveals about the walls and secrets of the titans, then faded into irrelevancy. They could've played a big role in s4 with their knowledge about the rumbling and the wall titans, maybe even helped the alliance or something and gave them clues on how to stop or prevent it all together or something. Wasted potential. And when Zeke was killed the titans just stood there instead of acting up due to sunlight like the pastors said they would.

Beginning of volume 13 (cut from the anime) Armin notes that even after Dina died, Eren could still controll the mindless titan: thus the royal blood worked for a few more minutes (or hours since the other titans didn't follow them). The bright Armin should have remembered this detail and be cautious about Zeke's death because it would either lead to Colossals going rouge or nothing since Eren should still have the power.

Obviously we know from 122 that Eren obtained full power and Zeke is no longer necessary. I guess he dragged him along to kill him later and that the original plan was to kill all the other shifters as well and reunite the powers into one. Which would explain his distance towards Armin and their friends in the latest years and why Falco (a JAW titan) could be able to fly.

tonormicrophone1,Spaghestis,"Eva didnt get a movie because people were dissatisfied with the ending, it got a movie because Gainax had basically ran out of budget for the last two episodes of the show. The original final episodes were supposed to basically be a split up version of the movie, but they didnt have the money to animate all the flashy stuff, so they instead went for the more abstract metaphorical route that left some confused. Shortly after the show ended, the movie got greenlit, so they now got the money to animate the original vision, so episodes 24/25 basically became the movie. Honestly, I like that it ended up like this since I think the final anime episodes and the movie complement each other well. 

Attack on Titan on the other hand was not plagued by any external restrictions that caused its ending to be neutered. As far as we know the ending we got is more or less what Isayama wanted. Also the vast majority of the fanbase likes the ending- the people active on titanfolk are the only ones who openly dislike the ending, and its not like this sub is bustling anymore. Maybe there are others spread out, but overall maybe only around 10k people dont like the ending, thats maybe like 1-2% of the total english fanbase. Also it seems like the Japanese fans unanimously like the ending, and their opinion will matter more for Isayama than the english fans. And even if Isayama agreed with the ending haters, the issues with the ending are too numerous to be fixed in a single movie. Like a movie would cover a max of 6 chapters, meaning 133-139. In order to properly fix the ending, youd have to go back and start changing stuff from like chapter 105.

I think that Zeke’s plan made the most sence to me but obviously wasn't a good nor acceptable option, Eren had his own solution so everyone would be free but the Alliance never proposed soemthing that seemed concrete and with long terms benefits. I also think it had to do with the worldbuilding but this is going to be long. In the end it seemed like a bad action which couldn't havd been stopped bc there were no other options, while I feel like the story wanted to portray Eren as a bad person, not only bc what he did was bad but also bc therr were other options.

If Eren had just become a head + spinal cord inside a crystal and made one of the Colossals carry him, the alliance would probably have had a harder time, and that's just one idea.


The whole final battle felt fake, with no stakes. It should have been impossible for the scouts to win, but they do so without a single death.


In Batman, the Dark Knight (2008), they do this properly.  Instead of a ""superhero save the world"" scenario, it's about two ships, one choosing to blow the other and the Joker. The stakes are smaller, the scale is smaller, but the tension feels real.


More important than the fact the scouts had no real plan is the problem the author created for himself when he made Eren's FT so godly powerful. If the author really intend for Armin and the scouts to find a way to defeat Eren, she should have made him defeatable.


I can accept the scouts going after Eren with no plan, willing to do anything they can to try to stop him, ready to die, since they were partially responsible for Eren getting the FT's power.


Killing wasn't a great plan, but since the Rymbling was already happening and they didn't have many other choices, there as a chance that doing so would stop the Rumbling. If it didn't work, it would just be a wreck on a wreck.

cpu9,theeshyguy,"Honestly I partially agree, which is kinda a problem in its own right. Isayama set up this conflict and stacked up all these reasons why the outside world *should* be rumbled, and then tried to turn and sell us this “Eren did it because he wanted to” bullshit, and *so many people* just *disagreed* with that canon reasoning.

It falls back on Yams’ nihilistic misanthropy; we can’t root for “the moralistic saviors of the world” because the world they’re idiotically defending is irredeemably awful. All the countries are like fuckin Warhammer factions, starting genocidal wars on whims, treating wars like they’re personal, and holding on to grudges for centuries. In Devilman, we feel bad for humanity because it’s a clear triumph of their hatred over their compassion, both of which were shown in great detail, but in AoT, humanity just never even has a “good side” that we would want to see preserved through the crisis.

Mfer justified global extinction and then tried to turn and criminalize the characters for seeing it *the way he made it*. Committing global mass murder *should* make a character unambiguously a villain, but he designed a trolley situation that makes people think “maybe not,” which seems to have muddied *his own* intentions with the framing of his story. It’s so stupid and weird.

Like, it he wanted Eren to do it *for himself* then we didn’t need all the reasons he listed. An Eren that disregards all reason for the rumbling beyond “I want to do it” wouldn’t become Hobo Eren or wait for the declaration of war, and the world wouldn’t need to unify in a genocidal war against Paradise, but for some reason, Isayama made all of those things happen anyway.",iirlppm,weyezw,titanfolk,2022-08-03 12:55:57,25,2,iir8xvf,theeshyguy,True

Great post and this is what I agree with the most. This defeatist message of ""bro humanity is bad so never bother to change broooo"" is such a wannabe deep message. 

I also want to add how creatively bankrupt the ending in general is. In Breaking Bad for example, Walter was never excused by people around him at the end or was treated as an ""uwu tragic misunderstood little lamb"" like Eren was in the ending. He was hated by his family, had to come clear what his true motivations were and then died alone and broken in the only place he had ever found any true joy in. 

If you want to show that your main character does something irredeemable, then don't fucking shy away from calling him out. Better Call Saul for example in the recent episode, makes no attempt at trying to portray Jimmy as tragic and misunderstood for what he did in the episode. Is he sympathetic? Yes, absolutely. But he's still to blame for what he does. 

This also should've applied to Eren, but no, I guess because of muh determinism and Ymir knows, he wasn't at fault, he was just BoRn ThIs WaY.",iir7hc6,weyezw,titanfolk,2022-08-03 09:49:25,30,1,,theeshyguy,False

Eren would pretty much be in grief after committing those atrocities, his desire for freedom led to the deaths of those cared about.

Like it isn’t in the manga and they created “foreshadow” for something that doesn’t exist. And it is not even like for the cool effect like the berserk titan, it is just there. It just created something random)


The only thing that is kinda cool in the anime version is seeing Eren saying he is gonna destroy the world, which is some cool foreshadow. But I would sacrifice this without second thought if I could make the anime be like the manga honestly. If this arc’s ending was equal and also the dream in episode 1 was equal to the manga, the aot anime would be even more solid. Throw in together not replacing some of Mikasa’s lines for extras “Eren!” and not changing her clan mark for some cloth (this isn’t a big deal but it kinda sucked they did this because many people thing her wrist mark comes out of nowhere in the fourth season) and there probably would be way less hate for Mikasa in the community also.

Am I wrong, maybe? okay the whole punching Dina mess, I think your pretty much right on that, however, it was through Eren’s POV, and you can see how Mikasa looked so much different, isayama confirmed that eren saw mikasa beautiful in his eyes, (lmk if you want the proof) does that mean love? No. but it had some meaning. Another thing is Mikasa had every right to see things through the lense of her child hood, she couldn’t see the future, she just wanted to listen to Carla as she felt obligated to protect eren, I feel like she was so more then such a low life that she is depicted as, I feel as if she were an average human placed in an unaverge life self. If that makes sense? Okay now when he told hee that he hated her, why would eren say he didn’t want Mikasa to be with anyone else if he didn’t have feelings for her?! if he hated he since they were kids, wouldn’t he not care?! What was the point if he just wanted her to be free?! Why would he want mikasa to love him after he died if he wanted her freedom?! Wouldn’t he want her to forget about him for freedom?

ProudTheory5520,Actual_Principle5004,"Have you looked into the interviews of how Mappa Season 4 production in the Animation Book from the source material has been and how they have been adapting the source material. especially the character designs and they mention about ""the final chapter""

[https://x.com/giokai\_gio/status/1707783831221154096?s=20](https://x.com/giokai_gio/status/1707783831221154096?s=20)

Also from the 100-Cam we can clearly see them working on the scenes from 137 and 138

And weird how you say this but forget that they have set up:

1. Eren and Armin's Conservation set up in 131 in 139 (You claim the conservation would be different but i doubt that and it just seems like cope)
2. They have already teased Mikasa having the decision to kill Eren with the scene of Reiner seeing himself in Eren due to him wanting to be stopped because he could not handle the weight of genocide.
3. They already did Hange's sacrifice better than the manga, And you want all of that to be meaningless because you want Violence to be the only answer with Eren need Historia as his sex trophy or whatever with their child

All i am saying is that they are clearly setting up the chapters where Eren is stopped/killed that is all. The point he is saying is that the anime has already followed the source material closely.

If they make the way 139 was presented differently from the manga but still keeping the same elements of Armin saying goodbye to Eren, The titan powers disappearing, Levi's Final Salute(The best panel from 139), The rest of the group becoming Peace Ambassadors and Mikasa visiting Eren's grave then fine or Even the Extra Pages. Because Eren is not the only important character, As Armin and Mikasa all play important roles in the rumbling arc

Shani_Jeizan,Soul_Stack,">we barely get any other reasons other than the fact that he saved her as a kid and that she now loves him.

That's so... You are missing so much. 

The guy not only saved her life, but motivated her to stand up and fight for herself. He gave her a motto to live by. Eren was the first thing/person who triggered an agency to do something within Mikasa. ""If you won't fight we can't live"". The girl lived away from the society in a really comfortable zone with her parents. She never faced such circumstances or was ever taught what to do in such a situation, she was merely 9 years old not to mention. 

After saving her, he even comforted with the scarf and gave a warm welcome in his family. The girl *just* lost literally everything wouldn't want to lose things again, would she, especially after losing her family a second time (Eren's parents). 

Carla, Eren's mom, even makes Mikasa make a promise to her, to always stand by Eren's side. 

>highlights a part of Eren and for Mikasa it always has to do with him saving her when they were 9

Everyone highlights the side of Eren with their experiences with him.

Mikasa's most 'important' experience with him was him saving her. She **always** highlights the kind, beautiful side of him. The way he saved her, his kindness, similar to how he saved Ramzi. 

Similarly when everyone started believing Eren has changed, Mikasa was the first person to highlight the fact that he hasn't. The flashback of him brutally killing those kidnappers says more than enough. Eren has always been like this. How he always runs far away from them. 

I don't even get these complains, honestly.....",maygk0s,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-04 18:41:50,6,3,may03wo,Shani_Jeizan,False
Shani_Jeizan,Soul_Stack,"You are making a post trying to 'criticize' a series, you can't do it based on 'vibes'. You can very much dislike the aspects of the characters and the story elements but your statements are rather bold and are accusing the characters of lacking things, which they aren't. Even an opinion should be easy to defend, but if you can't provide a counter point then you are more so supposed to accept the opposing opinion. 

What's 'bare minimum' for you isn't the bare minimum for a heavily traumatized girl who is so attached to that person. It's easy for *you* to acknowledge Eren's actions and straight up confront him, not for Mikasa, who the first time in her entire life was witnessing her driving force doing such horrible things.

Mikasa had always used Eren as a beacon to *fight* the cruelty of that world. She thinks it's all just misery, cruelty and suffering but then there was this one person who showed kindness to her at the lowest point of her life, which made her look up to him. You wouldn't be able to one day just stand up and confront your eternally loving parents on discovering something awful they did, and get them locked up, would you. It takes courage, the ability of acceptance and Mikasa's case is just ao much worse and worse. 

I highlighted in my other comment what that guy has done for her, and in such a case having to accept him as a whole for who he is, standing against him, accepting the idea of KILLING him and then actually becoming the one to kill him is no way easy for Mikasa. You can NOT compare the relationship of other characters and what Eren means to them with Mikasa's relationships and value of him. You are missing out Mikasa's POV and pretty much don't even see her character arc and the issues she has imo. ""I expected more"" isn't really a reply.",mb1khet,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-05 04:09:03,5,3,mazdbs0,Shani_Jeizan,False
Shani_Jeizan,Soul_Stack,"Mikasa's arc in Trost serves as a 'foundation' for her character, and highlights the major flaws she has as a person, and as a character in general. Mikasa was just 'louder' in Trost arc compared to the story further ahead. You need to take a more careful look at her character to really understand her progression throughout the story.

Despite being a pretty subdued character, she consistently has key moments in almost every single arc so I am not sure how much I agree with anything you said about her. 

Same for her development, it is very evenly spread throughout the story, she doesn't lack development that's pretty certain.

Saying she sacrificed 'nothing' is also a statement I can't make sense of. The will to kill the man and choose her ideals, her friends and the innocents over him, or just her duty over Family, is probably one of the most consistent character arc of hers. I shouldn't even need to go indepth about how much that guy means to her, and how hard the choice big of a choice it is. Mikasa spent her 4 years with him in peace during the time skip as well. Her time spent in the cabin doesn't take away anything imo.

One of the first things that Mikasa points out on meeting him is acknowledging the mass murder he was doing in Liberio. Mikasa straight up verbalises her motivations to join the Alliance ""I don't want Eren to kill anymore innocents, even if it for us"", as much as it has to do with Eren (which her driving force, like everyone else) it is very much about serving her duty. Mikasa doesn't 'verbally' challenges his ideology in the final battle, she 'acts' against it, literalized by her killing him and throwing away the cruel side of him. She didn't 'let' him die, she chose his death.

Take RTS as an example where she lets Armin die because Erwin was a better choice for humanity's survival. 

And tbh idk I don't agree to anything here, especially Mikasa, seems like you missed a good chunk or maybe didn't consider it.

Eren was my personal favorite so seeing this be done to him was…. truly an experience. It always frustrated me how this series beat down so hard on Eren for using violence to fix problems, yet we NEVER see an actual peaceful solution or peaceful handling be fully, successfully executed in this series. Armin should have done more, there should have been more effort put into showing him actually succeed using his words. But we never actually see this.

Shani_Jeizan,Warm-Bison2006,"Shame I discover this so late: Let me start by saying, if you felt that way no one can really say anything against that, but it feels like you set yourself up for failure by having wrong expectations that then clouded your judgement. Most people like you end up in the hell that is titanfolk or ANR, so I guess good you stayed on the good side lol.

Mikasa is the one most obvious to me since I spent a bit of time trying to understand the character. In my opinion it was never her ""job"" to confront Eren ideologically, that's what Armin did. Mikasa confronted him emotionally in that sense. I really don't understand what you mean by she sacrificed nothing, but the reason you may feel underwhelmed is because you misunderstood what happened to her? Because she did NOT let go of Eren, that was the point.

Armin and Eren I feel like are kinda fair\[?\] At least these are a little more subjective. I found some of your reaction to S4 very interesting, since it has so many memorable moments (maybe too much is happening? xd) => Declaration of War, Liberio Attack/Sasha Death, Table Scene, The entire episode trio pre-rumbling with Eren dying/Zeke and Eren in the paths and the Rumbling starting, The entire Rumbling?!...  
Unsure what to tell you.

Also out of curiosity why did you hate the Ymir ending?  
I feel like hating on Season 4 is a bit strange, since especially the first part is VERY strong, War for Paradis kinda loses itself at times in the action and the conclusion (the narrative coming together in the end) is slightly below average for AOT (probably like 9/10 for me with the rest 10/10 lol, but I guess I do get where you are coming from)",mbqwa76,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-09 00:35:57,2,1,,Shani_Jeizan,False

And she doesn’t ‘blindly’ follow Eren, she just chooses to be next to him.

Aot isn't pushing a pro-pacifism message. In fact, it promotes fighting when necessary and it explicitly criticizes inaction, pacifism, slave morality and self-hatred. The problem with Eren is that all he has is violence, it's the sole way he can derive meaning - through the existence of his enemies.

redeclipse619,sp1ke__,"> A major, central character to one of the biggest arcs in the story is written off by getting impregnated by a literal random guy who we don't even see the name or face of.

If that doesn't at least raise your eyebrow, you paid no attention to the story whatsoever. I feel like people just say that to be contrarian because the critique of that part is heavily associated with EH/titanfolk/AnR crowd and they do not want to admit they might be at least partially right.

I definitely agree that just because someone's character arc is ""completed"" doesn't mean they have to be written off. Sometimes an arc is not needed at all. Look at Gintoki in Gintama. His arc is completed. He's almost 30 years old after ton of experiences, a war veteran etc. and all we see is how his character reacts to various situations.  Not to mention i have to say that becoming a ruler is not the end of your arc, your work only just begins.

What pains me is that she is so lazily sidelined compared to everyone else. Yes, Season 4/post-timeskip has a lot of issues, especially with dumbing down of characters and worldbuilding, but she is the most extreme case i think. She has been there from the start. She was part of the original squad from the start, why Connie and Jean deserve to be central in the endgame but she doesn't? She also fought titans alongside them and was their friend so to treat her like that narratively is very concerning.

One thing that people might not notice is that she doesn't have a SINGLE scene in post-timeskip that is not some sort of flashback aside from just a few 2-3 second shots of her standing or sitting in a chair or something. We literally never see her react to current events. Even in the endgame we just read her letter and that's about it.",l4l9oe3,1crxnqs,AttackOnRetards,2024-05-18 14:13:23,2,1,,redeclipse619,False

Dependent_Lab8918,GLNK1,"131 and 139 is just way too much content for one episode. Dawn of Humanity adapted about 30 pages of chapter 130, and about 25 pages of 123. On top of that, the second half of 130 has tons of large panels, some double page spreads and not all that much dialogue. Even then, it only just fit inside 1 episode. Chapter 139 is 45 pages on its own, and that's not including the extra pages they may well include at the end of the episode. 131 up until it cuts to the boat is about 30 pages as well. There's just no way you could also fit 131 in there, even if you're only going to show the Eren section at the beginning.

Even without that, I don't think it's a great idea. The brutality of 131 is crucial in helping people empathise with and support the alliance, it's hard to fully grasp how awful the rumbling is without that. 134 does a good job as well, but I think you need the more personal moment with Ramzi. On top of that, coming off 138 we'd already know that Eren is dead and has lost, so I don't see how the stakes would be there for the first half of 131. I can see the logic in it making some of Erens motivations clearer to the audience, but I don't think that would really be the best way to do it.",ij50mw7,whb84d,AttackOnRetards,2022-08-06 04:41:09,10,1,,Dependent_Lab8918,False

AdImpossible6194,Warm_starlight,"Her decision was implicitly influenced by Eren though. Before being pulled in the paths she was struggling with the idea of killing him. Immediately after she comes out of it she is determined to kill him but it isn't grief or conflict we see on her face, but a smile before she lops off his head. She also knew all of Ymir's situation. This suggests that Eren talked to her about it in the paths just like he did with Armin. She already knew her role in all of this and saving both Ymir and everyone else. He explained everything to everyone when he met them as we see their reactions (Jean, Annie, Reiner, Connie and such) so it would be weird to assume only Mikasa was left in the dark. 

I think it's only presented as an independent choice, but it wasn't. I would have prefered if she made the choice without having any knowledge and without being pulled in the paths prior to that. Only then could she be pulled in the paths before Eren's life completely ran out and explained everything so she doesn't live blaming herself and wondering.",j9e4arc,117lu90,AttackOnRetards,2023-02-21 07:35:58,4,1,,AdImpossible6194,False

Sebox_,AlphaCockGigaNuts,"No, that's just untrue. As fucked up as the ending is, I have gotten over it. I have no reason to feel the same, absolute hatred I felt when I first read that atrocity of a chapter. Well played, Yams. 

But, I will say this. Erwin's entire motivation was to find out the truth behind the walls. He strived to prove his father right, that there were humans out there. With him realising that there is no love for them outside the walls, His purpose is basically over. And as a far more effective and ruthless Commander than Hange, He would take extreme measures to make sure that his island survives. Sure, be mah try to avoid the Rumbling, but if it remains the only option, he wouldn't hesitate and make sure that the entire world to trampled, so that Paradis doesent face any future threat (unlike that moron Eren, who saved like 20% of the world and Paradis still ended up getting nuked.) 

Tldr; Floch said it himself: Erwin is the devil himself. He was the Devil before Eren was. He would do unimaginable things to make sure his people live.

Sonik_Phan,Paclone,"Depends on the person.

For example, I already quite disliked the rumbling arc because of the constant ass pulls, lack of stakes, off-putting humor and overall not matching the tone of the series, even before 139. It had great moments(131, 134), but a lot of the Alliance moments were really badly executed.

When i read 139, i felt nothing really. I even thought I liked it at first, but honestly, I just was ready to accept any ending at the time. I just wanted the series to stick the landing. I wanted the series to be over and was ready to accept whatever ending we ended up with.

However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that despite the Rumbling arc being messy, 139 was another level. It retconned every single important event of the series and it lead to nothing. If Eren had the power to control Dina, he had the power to control all Pure Titans. Hence, he was responsable for all the deaths in the series. If this lead to something, like the end of the cycle of hatred *against Eldians*, i would understand, but it was all for nothing. 

Besides, every single character turned into a shell of themselves. It was all about love, when it never was. Honestly, if you think about it, almost every character was ruined in the ending. Historia chose a farmer who threw rocks, Eren decided he didnt have any motivation, Armin decided to care more about Mikasa feelings than the rumbling and the lives that were lost. Ymir decided to love an abuser, and Reiner last moment was to be a sniffe. Jean decided to marry a girl who never cared about him, and honestly thats quite a shame.",k8xss0b,17tc6k9,AttackOnRetards,2023-11-12 16:46:21,-2,2,k8vynih,Sonik_Phan,False

Yes war continued as is in that timeline, but it also in the rumbling timeline. Eren throughout S4 and the final seasons exhibits is convincing himself the rumbling is for the greater good, it’s not Eren wanted a sandbox of a world to play in and took it personally when that wasn’t the case and blamed the world because it made him so it deserves him.

Reasonable_Carob2534,YardOk5005,"I always saw Eren’s change as him trying ‘something new’ since it follows a theory I love that Eren’s future self is constantly manipulating his past self via how the Attack Titan inheritors can receive memories from the future as well as the past. 

This is linked to the first chapter in the manga and the anime (I think it’s been a long while) where Eren talks to Mikasa about the future, like her hair being short. 

So theory goes that Eren is trying to find a ‘perfect’ timeline where everything goes according to plan and the people he loves gets a happy ending. Ofc, it’s not perfect perfect, since Sasha dies and he was expecting it but I’d say 8/10 is better than 0/10.

I saw the part where Mikasa and Eren run away as a previous timeline where Eren did what he wanted and I see the current timeline where he starts the rumbling as him sacrificing himself for his friends even though he wants to live with them.

So he does things like guiding the smiling titan to eat his mother in order to keep Berthold alive, and in the same way he forced his own father to kill the royal family in order to steal the Progenitor Titan; he’s been manipulating the past to get a ‘good ending’ for his friends. 

One where War ends. 

This can also be seen when Eren’s dad meets the Owl and the Owl says,

“If you want to save them all… Mikasa, Armin and the others… Carry out your mission until the end.”

I always saw this as Eren’s desires leaking even the past users because he wishes to keep all of them safe. 

I’d even go as far as to say, Eren was the reason Grisha lead his sister to go outside therefore ensuring he met Diana, Zeke was born and Eren afterwards.

He’s definitely capable of it since he got the smiling titan to eat his own mother, therefore ensuring Armin became the future Colossal Titan and that his younger self would hate titans: creating the plot we read/watched in order to take revenge. 

As well as forcing his dad to massacre a family. 

So yeah, at least in my head canon, the moment after ‘The End’ Eren wakes up underneath that tree on a hill, confused about his dream and ready to repeat the story; albeit with a few changes in order to get that happy ending he’s been looking for.

Saying that, I’m definitely a little biased since I really like time stuff like regression (when done right)

Anyways, I saw the post and got reminded of all this so thanks for the blast from the past.

Also it does suck Fr that we barely see Eren in the latter half, granted it makes sense from a narrative standpoint since there’s supposed to be that whole ‘he becomes a villain’ thing while his friends try to stop him but as you said it would’ve been nicer to see what Eren was thinking before he straight up told us. 

Felt like his main character status got switched to antagonist for plot reasons.

Another example is when hange and Levi were talking about the dead survey corps members and later on when levi to give your heart( [I also think levi looked a little sadder in the manga](https://images.app.goo.gl/WEEYBebV1hXinQPMA) . One last thing when hange was appointing Armin commander, the ost should have switched to bauklotze instead of staying on footsteps of doom.

I expected muller to sound more regretful when gave his speech and I didn't think the ost( the global allied fleet)  fitted the scenes. I believe this concludes my nitpicks and critics.

Now on to the good shit.Ramzi's death and the rumbling was horrifically beautiful(if that makes any sense) I liked how got to the fate of Eren's grandparents, the pure desperation of the people trying to escape the rumbling, and the brutality of it all was executed very well. The build-up to Eren's freedom scene was great but found the actual ironic panel itself was ok. The new soundtrack for the rumbling and eren freedom panel was also good.

Now for 132's adaption. Floch's death was good but hange's was something else, the animation was so fucking kino l  didn't expect it to be that good, and great ost choice too.

EnterVENOM,i_love_petergriffin,"I’m super interested to see the “I don’t want that” scene. Like yeah it’s funny but also Isayama draws Eren so ugly/funny looking when he’s crying, but in the Anime he never looks as bad when he’s having his little rage moments. Im curious to see if they keep the crying the same or if they change it up a bit and make it not as gross. Jean and Connies goodbye is gonna hit hard, even if they’re brought back like 10 min later. Also seeing Beren at the tree is gonna be pretty cool, my favorite part of the extra pages",jhcspyr,12vtyj0,AttackOnRetards,2023-04-23 06:06:34,13,1,,EnterVENOM,False
