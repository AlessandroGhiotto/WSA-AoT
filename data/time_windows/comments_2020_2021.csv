I wasn't either. It would seem Eren could have gotten both the Jaw and Armor titan then and there with minimal effort.

I feel this was primarily written so to set up future events, but something Falco said about Reiner in a previous episode stood out to me: that a titan's ability to live and fight is tied to their will.

Chungulungus,formantzero,"I think you're basically right. It's called ""anti-natalism"" in philosophy. One general argument I've heard goes about like this: 

> By virtue of being born, a person will encounter suffering. If you seek to minimize harm and suffering, you should not make a decision to have children because you are guaranteeing they will suffer.

I think this is obviously a putrid way to view the world, and I don't think we're necessarily supposed to sympathize with this viewpoint. Although, it seems like the situation in Eldia has some complexities since Eren said that basically none of them have free will. Still, anti-natalism often ignores positive aspects of being alive, and who knows if they may be able to win free will as Eldians instead of choosing auto-genocide by psychic castration.",grqynry,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-21 23:32:21,5,2,grqx2dg,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

I also think this is not the right path to take, and I don't think Eren actually agrees with Zeke, because Eren has always been about freedom.

HarisNd88,Payment-Hour,"I started reading the manga some month ago and also it was my first one. At first, it was a bit weird, I think I have missed details in panels because of my “lack of experience” lol. But apart from that, I learned that it depends on 1. On your personal preferences (for example, I pay a lot of attention to the OST and some people don’t care about them) 2. In the type of chapters you are reading. 

I prefer reading heavy dialog chapters because in anime I can’t take my time to process information. Then, action chapters are great for seeing them animated. For example, I wasn’t expecting that much from the assault chapter and it ended to be my fav in this season. However, I was too excited about the declaration of war and it was a bit overwhelming. Apart from that, I enjoy watching the anime version despite knowing what is going to happen ( I think I have more hype than before). The bad thing is when the manga puts your expectations too high and the anime can’t reach them.

To test number 1. I recommend you to read for example Return to Shiganshina arc (an arc with plot twists and heavy action-packed) or another one and compare this experience to what you saw in the anime. It’s not gonna be the same because now you know what happened, but you can make an idea of what reading a manga is and how much do you like it. 

Apart from that, if you decide to read the manga, don’t make the same mistake as I did: don’t read the whole manga in a few hours. Take your time. Because you will reach a point where you will be lost.",gqyphgo,m588t0,attackontitan,2021-03-15 01:37:02,4,1,,HarisNd88,False

This episode explored issues with Paradis showing us that Paradis could be as shitty as Marley because while they are punishing those who are racist to Eldians what are they doing to those who are racist to Marley? It could just be Marley all over again but with reversed roles.

I’m hyped for episode 17 when that comes out but I wasn’t really satisfied with this episode mostly because I don’t like cliffhangers especially cliffhangers that end when all the action is about to go down.

Also the rematch with Levi and Zeke was awesome even if 3D monke didn’t look good. And then the Yeagerists just go ahead and have the 109th cadets beat Kieth possibly to death. As if that wasn’t enough we have Zeke get tortured by Levi in a scene which I’m surprised was able to air on television you got Zeke with the thunder spear in the side and exposed wounds all over his body. 

Zeke’s backstory was really sad do you just wanted to have a childhood but Grisha was a pretty shit father and yes I know he wants revenge for his sister and his aunt after he heard she was eaten alive by dogs that doesn’t excuse what he did to Zeke and honestly I don’t blame Zeke for doing what he did. The closest thing he had to a father was the previous beast titan Tom Ksaver and all they did was talk and play catch just goes to show how badly he was treated by Grisha then at least his father isn’t Rodd Riess. Zeke also shows just how much he cares about Eren in this episode despite knowing nothing about him other than he is his half brother he goes to paradis to save him from Grisha. even though he didn’t need saving. He also gives Eren Tom’s baseball which was really nice seven giving Zeke some much needed character development. And Zeke isn’t dead they wouldn’t kill of a major character like that plus if he’s dead it would mean Eren would fight against the Titans alone (this is in a spoiler it’s pretty obvious it’s gonna happen in Pieck wouldn’t invade Paradis alone) which I really hope isn’t the case because I want to see the brothers fighting side-by-side.",grskgms,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-22 10:17:10,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

His entire speech is riddled with contradictions. He calls Armin a slave but he has the founding Titan which is the ultimate slaver of anyone’s will. Dude has memories of three lines of Titan shifters and has the audacity to call Armin a slave? 

He says Mikasa will always be compelled to protect him but in season 1, Eren insulted Armin and Mikasa punched him in the face. In season 3, Eren told Mikasa how much she meant to him and said he would wrap that scarf around her as many times as he would have too. 

When Armin was about to die, Eren cried in front of Levi to tell him how much Armin wanted to see the world and how if anyone would save the world it would  be Armin. 

When Eren tells Armin they never fought because they both understood the skill gap between them, he wants Armin to take that as a hint that he’s bluffing big time. Those tow never fought not because the fight would be unfair but because they’re best friends and love each other. 

Eren knows Armin is smart and will figure out all of these contradictions and eventually Mikasa will tok after they’ve both calmed down. 

Someone also pointed out to me that Eren saying the fight between them isn’t fair is a hint for Armin to go colossal next time they have to brawl in order to close the skill gap.

Due to Zeke’s responsibility in turning the people of Paradis island into Titans and killing mosf of the scout regiment, I don’t think it’s likely that the scouts would let him join their side. What I think is more probably is Zeke aligning himself with Eren for some ulterior agenda. The reveal this episode that Eren has strayed from the plan makes me believe in this theory even more. Not to mention the baseball Eren had and the fact that they are brothers and Titans so they could have some kind of other worldly connection. Zeke was also not trapped with Pieck and Porko but that mysterious guard. To me, it has also seemed that Zeke distrusts the marleyan military somewhat as in the very first episode of this season, Colt asks him what’s special about Zeke’s blood, and Zeke recognizing that Magath is nearby give Colt a humorous answer.

Like yeah it's a point of no return for Eren, but also don't forget 1) Marley started this with an attack on civilians (including Eren's mom), 2) Marley and the world just declared war on Paradis, 3) Marley is full of racist assholes who have been terrorizing the peaceful islanders of Paradis for 100 years, and 4) a few episodes ago they were talking about how they absolutely need to take Paradis Island for the resources and time to reconsolidate their military around growing technology rather than the titans, so they're definitely coming for Paradis. They brought this upon themselves, and they deserve it.

On the other hand, these civilians did not make those decisions and they don't deserve it. If all of this goes back to the murder of Eren's mom, how many mothers and families have been killed by him just now? I'm certainly not happy to see him become the very monster he swore to destroy, consumed by hatred. But like Armin said, in a world as cruel as this only those capable of sacrificing their humanity can rise above monsters and change things.

This season has also shown them also at war with another nation, so their end game is to obtain all titans and rule the world right?

Who the hell could the guy from the zeppelin be though. Pretty sure he isn’t from Paradis, but he seems loyal to them. Also he has a different uniform than the rest

It’s nitpicky but Mikasa looks really good, last episode she had a few odd-looking shots, I’m glad that wasn’t her actual look

It’s so cool how Eren can now transform instantly after leaving the titan body. Stamina 100. 

Damn Eren really took all of Porcos limbs and forced him to break the crystal! All while having that scary open-mouth face. That was so badass

Can’t wait to see how the Warhammer power will be used. Porco might get some of it too since he kinda had her body in his mouth. Idk.

Then you get to the most recent two episodes of season 4 and watch Reiner’s heart drop as their pure fear he has of Eren arises when he sees them, Pieck look on in astonishment and fear as she sees that ODM once again, and Gaillard be in complete disbelief as a bunch of ordinary humans swoop down on him to finish off one of the 9 titans with no second thought in their mind.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OGFN_Jack,"Because people still can't seem to understand why the Eren and Gabi comparison makes 0 sense I will try to go through every point as clear as possible.

Eren and Gabi's hometowns were both attacked by foreign enemies that is true. However, lets look at the circumstances between the two

**Paradis/Eren**

* Paradis is a place surrounded by gigantic walls, as massive titans who eat them roam their island. These walls effectively trap the majority of the population in a place where they can never leave as they fear the titans who for some unknown reason inhabit their island eat any human they see.
* One random day, two very powerful titans attack Eren's hometown for an unknown reason. Slaughtering half the population, including Eren's mom, thus fueling Eren's hatred for Titans as they killed his people, his mom, and destroyed the town he lived for a reason he does not know.
* He joins the scouts and ends up learning he has the power of the attack titan. He uses this power to liberate his people from the titan threat, watching many of his comrades fall along the way and learns that a place called Marley has been sending titans to their island for years, and sent Reiner and co. there to recover something called The Founding Titan. Learning that he has more enemies responsible for so much death and destruction, he sets out towards Marley to get his revenge

**Marley/Gabi**

* Marley is a country that is run by a government that forces Eldians to live in an interment zone and fight in wars Marley starts.
* Gabi is a part of a select few group of talented kids are selected to be apart of their program where they are going to be injected with something that turns them into killing machines with the potential to wipe out an entire city if they wanted to. 
* These powers that they will receive will allow them to travel to Paradis and exterminate the entire island. The people of Paradis have never left their island to attack Marley, yet apparently they are ""devils"" and a ""threat to world peace"". Gabi is determined to achieve the role of the armored titan, and as someone who has already murdered hundreds, is overjoyed at the opportunity to go to Paradis and wipe them all out. 
* As her country declares war publicly on Paradis, Gabi is ecstatic to attack these people, even though she has never once seen first hand that they are of any threat to her and has only been told. As this announcement happens, Eren and co. attack destroying Gabi's hometown and killing multiple of her friends.
* As she prepares to attack them, Falco, someone who has gone through the exact same experience as her, tells her that he learned that the reason they are doing this is because they were attacked years ago by none other than Reiner and co. 
* Even though this is a wildly dumb claim to make up, and knowing that Falco is just as upset as her Gabi decides to use the logic that if she didn't see it, then it didn't happen and ignores this. Even after hearing this, Gabi's thirst for blood doesn't settle, and she sneaks on board the ship, killing Sasha.

If you read all of this, and think that there are any real similarities outside of the fact that their homes were attacked, then I'm really not sure what else to tell you.",gljko5e,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 02:04:39,6,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

1. Reiner explained that the reason he destroyed the wall was so that they could slip into the chaos. Was it necessary to break the wall? Absolutely not.

2. Tybur KNEW this attack was coming and knowingly set up the stage and groups of people so that they would die. So is it really just Eren in the wrong or is it Marley as well for allowing this to happen?

This is war. Yes, Eren could've taken the peaceful route, but do you really think that the Marleyan's would have taken the peaceful route in eradicating all of Paradis Island? Do you think that if Eren somehow killed nobody in his attack that Marley wouldn't sacrifice their own people to benefit themselves?

Eren may be the bad guy but someone needed to be. I love Mikasa and her peaceful mindset, but it's kill or be killed especially when Tybur had just declared war.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"ok.. so I have a theory I mentioned on last week's podcast (link in profile) that i THINK is reinforced by this episode. Preface: i'm an anime only watcher, and I'm guessing other people have thought of this already too, but:

I think Eren's goal is to eat ALL of the titans (he now has 3: founding, attack + war hammer) so that he can control all 9.. But not for military superiority, but so that he can eliminate titan control and hand down the curse of the titans in order to remove their existence from the earth for the benefit of humanity. he was inches from taking Galliard in this episode, too.

Of course, him not going for Beast or Cart (and Beast seemingly being killed) this episode might poke holes in this... and maybe there are more holes I'm not thinking of cause I'm still buzzing from this episode... but i don't know. seems like it might fit.

Thoughts?

•	⁠Willy knew something was up and that he was likely gonna die. Explains his emotion last episode.

•	⁠Magath also had a heads up and was prepared to retaliate

•	⁠a big one: EREN DID THIS WITHOUT DIRECT COORDINATION WITH THE SCOUTS? he is surprised mikasa and crew showed up. How long has he been under cover? Has he disobeyed orders?


•	⁠the mikasa and Levi arrivals were amazingly timed and cinematic.

•	⁠cliffhangers on cliffhangers. Man. I want to hear what Levi has to say about erens actions -  if everyone gets out of this alive...

•	⁠lastly, I hate to say this, because I have refused to complain so far, BUT... I finally get that the titan CG was a little clunky, specifically in this episode, mostly Erens. Still shots were great, but the more we saw his whole body moving, the more jarring it was.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,PartTimeOtakuPodcast,"so many twist and turns, i loved this episode. too much to process. a few fav moments:

&#x200B;

\- the constant reversals of 'Team Marley' having advantage - quickly followed by the scouts reversing was amazing

\- I say it every week, but I am so glad we got to know these new characters before we saw this stuff, it matters SO much more when they are at odds.

\- Loved the coordination of the scouts. Levi using the opening to take out the Beast was surreal. I will be irritated Zeke he survives this.. but I feel like he will because we may have more to learn from him? As in a final confrontation with Eren?

\- Eren using the Jaw titan as a 'tool' was both one of the most badass and simultaneously terrifying moments of the show for me.

\- I was hopeful that Reiner was going to drift off peacefully, but of course he can't.. I think we are finally getting ready to say goodbye to his character after some great development.

\- the music was really great this episode

Is it a literal time loop, or more of a theoretical 'Oh we'll just keep attacking each other's civilizations with titans every few decades' kind of thing.

First, I'm crying because I just realised we'll never again see the happy-go-lucky cast we all love so much. Those 15 year olds who made jokes and smiled at each other are gone. From here on out were going to see adults weighed down by the blood of thousands, all to aware that they have no right to be happy. 

Secondly, I'm honestly glad that they're getting their revenge but they're ultimately proving the Marleyans right by doing so. They no longer have the chance to say ""you were wrong about us"" and they've truly chosen to become the devils they were portrayed as for decades.

I've managed to avoid spoilers so far so believe me when I say I genuinely don't know who will die, but when they do, it's likely that they wont feel fear as the people in the previous seasons did, but rather see their deaths as an atonement for their sins.

Basically the only path they can take is to become an imperial power and enter into an almost never ending war, just like Marley had.

Now, tie all of that together with Sasha. All she wanted was to reclaim her farmland so that she could enjoy delicious food and a peaceful life. That peace will never come to the eldians of paradis island, and Sasha has shown us how terrible war can be. 

This final season is really knocking it out of the park. What a brilliant tragedy. What an interesting focus for the show.

But moreso than the animation is the actual directing itself, the cuts, pacing, the time spent on certain shots. It's not ***awful****,* but it's definitely underwhelming.

Compare the Warhammer Titan fight with Levi v. Beast Titan fight, and you'll see the gulf of difference in tightness, pacing, and integration with music, which I also thought was poorly done.

They been doing that for years to survive so it’s second nature now. I don’t blame Porco for it, I would too if Levi came out of nowhere and nearly incapacitated me.

Plot, direction and music wise the episode was awesome, so far each new episode has been better than the last. That said, I could only feel sad as I watched what could have been one of the most awesome action scenes so far held back by animation. I'm sure mappa is doing the best they can with the time they were given, cutting only the necessary corners due to time constraints and during non-busy scenes the art and animation is just as good as it's always been. But during the action scenes it doesn't compare, the cgi is very noticeable and immersion breaking and the camera angles are not nearly as complex. I tried thinking of it more like an animated manga with voices instead of a full on anime but I still couldn't help feeling sad that we couldn't keep the 10/10 going on this final stretch. I feel like once again people are only thinking in complete extremes, either being full on hateful dicks or praising mappa to high heaven for a flawless adaptation even better than seasons 1-3 and nobody is being honest/fair. They are obviously very skilled and passionate and that shows, they did their best with what they were given and they deserve our respect for that. However the compromises are obvious and that's the truth of it imo. It's not bad but it doesn't hold up to the standard it's set so far which imo has been a benchmark for the industry in general. Even if we had to wait another 2 years I'd have much preferred that personally instead of a rushed adaptation. Once again people in suits who want the money and don't give a shit have messed with something people love, and mappa who are doing their best to patch up their shitty decision are taking all the backlash.

SSSS gridman vibes.


Then there was also some 3d very well hidden due to camera angles and by mixing in some gorgeous 2d animation for some the hammer titan and eren scenes. But then, again when eren got impailed with the 3d spike around the 10 minute mark, they showed his 3d model just lying there like a mecha suit at 9:26-9:29 and i was completely out of it.


Also something I noticed was they have also used 3d models for the paradis people. They painted over them well but the way they move and speak to each other, they move in a very stiff robotic way that i've seen in other shows before. 15:13-15-17, is all cgi movement for example. Also, in 15:19-15:21 right after seems just so stiff. Their faces and mouths are also done in a way that you can barely tell which character is which, like sasha and connie are very animated expressive people normally. 



That's all. It is what it is I guess. I think they showed they know how to mask the 3d with 2d animation cause when they did it, it was so smoothly done, so they might fix them later for the season's release for blu ray. Maybe they could do some dramatic close ups with 2d drawings to make things looks smoother during the fights, we'll see in like a year when it comes out.",gjo7bfz,kz8wir,attackontitan,2021-01-18 02:10:51,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sinplyevanlopez,"One thing I’d like to point out is how the War Hammer doesn’t have ent interest in Eren himself. It’s been stated that the War Hammer has been privately owned by the Tyburs for years now, and that they have no relation to Marley’s military. She tries to finish if Eren quickly and kill him instead of eating him and taking his powers. Frankly doing so would hurt Marley a lot more than help it, because then they’d have no idea who now has the Attack Titan and if it goes rogue it would harm everyone. This makes me think that she’s acting on her own personal vendetta? Like she couldn’t care less for war politics and instead is acting on her own moral compass and avenging the slaughtered. Since she’s not one for war, this makes me believe that she could essentially be a wildcard for either side to manipulate or sway to their side. Also, Mikasa says something of interest. She says, “Eren please... Come home.” This kinda hints that he went off on his own, that he’s a rogue soldier and none of this was part of their plan. Eren was definitely gambling on her and the rest of the Scouts chasing after him because of his later line. He says something like, “You guys actually came.” I think this means that the rest of the Scouts(probably lead by Jean, Levi, and Armin), are acting on their own. I think they plan on taking Eren and getting the hell out of there because they’re in enemy territory and they don’t time or supplies to hunker down and establish a base there. Speaking of Armin, we saw him in the last episode. I’m willing to bet that the bearded soldier who lead Pieck and Galliard to the trap was Armin. Considering his close proximity to the rest of his teammates, I don’t think that if he transforms, and that’s a big if, he’s gonna cause a lot of destruction. I think he’s gonna stay as a human and act as an impromptu strategist like always and get Eren and the squad back home. Few things of note in the second half. Magath is having the whole internment zone surrounded by soldiers and it makes me wonder how Armin is gonna get everyone out of there. Now I’m thinking that he might actually transform and carry everyone back to paradis. For the rumbling to happen, the Colossal Titans have to cross the ocean so the sea must not be more than 60 meters deep. Also, Gabi ran off with a gun from one of her dead buddies into the war zone. I don’t think she dies here because they just killed off Udo and Zofia. This also makes me think that Falco’s still alive as well. These two got a lot more development, and they’re both interesting characters. Lastly, the War Hammer is controlled remotely with its user encased in a hardened shell much like how Annie was at the end of season 1. This means that Annie’s still alive, and since Erens trying to eat the War Hammer that means his jaw can break through the case meaning he can probably get Annie out of there. Annie was genuinely remorseful for what she did and she hated the whole mission in the first place. She wanted to go back after Marcel was eaten. She might honestly join Erens side. That’s all I have for this episode, keep in mind I’m an anime only and these are just my thoughts so please don’t spoil anything if you know.

It has been a huge disappointment since episode 1 but I've been holding it back since people kept saying to wait for it, it's gonna be worth it. It has not. Why do I have to look at the world through the perspective of the people outside of Paradis? They are exactly as evil as Eren and the Paradis people think they are. That piece of shit Gabi is annoying, arrogant, spoiled and eager to kill human beings. Stop fucking comparing her to Eren in the past. Eren saw his mom being eaten ALIVE. He knew nothing, he couldn't understand why it had to happen. This piece of shit Gabi knows. She is hyped for the war declaration. They WANTED to START the war with Paradis first before Eren transformed. Your people wanted to start the chain of violence and you don't understand WHY? 

Story aside, what have the animators done to our characters? They all have chubby looking face. You can barely recognize Mikasa if it's not thanks to her voice, she looks like a freaking man! The CGs kill all the hype moments. Remember how badass Levi, Mikasa were???

Ffs, I don't care how the people outside of the world feels, why don't you give me the perspective of Eren of the scouts? WHY has the main character of the show changed???

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kitsune-oni,"Couple of thoughts. 

1) Armin with beard. Armin has a beard. Bearded Armin. 

2) These first five episodes have made me feel so much for Reiner that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. Like homie just constantly has it rough and can never catch a break. He was doing what he thought was right. If anything its the Marleys fault. So...

3) Why can't Eren just scoop of the Eldians in Marley and have them all live in Paradis? It seems like a reasonable idea. Eldians in Marley are treated poorly ans they'll never be ""equal."" But by moving to Paradis and joining forces together, they could be equal. Given, the islanders would probably resent the Eldians, but its better than living in Marley, right? 

4) And why pit Titans/Eldians/Paradis Islanders together? Yall are the exact same. I kinda hope Falco sees that (if he's still alive) and tries to bring everyone together. The Titan race could literally take over the world if they wanted to. So why do the Marlyean Titans stand by Marley so much if they're mistreated? I understand its for their families. But do they not see that there's so much in common between them and Paradis? Is ""Paradis = Bad"" just so far ingrained in their minds at this point?

And Armin! Let’s just say he got out of the friend zone and went 0-100 real quick! But on a serious note, I feel so bad for him. The pain that he must feel with how much destruction his Colossal can do. He’s so kind hearted that I’m sure all of this will weigh on him. It definitely makes you feel bad for the innocent victims in Marley. But the same goes for all the innocent in Paradis when Marley attacked too. That’s the thing about war, everyone gets hurt regardless of what side they’re on. 

I can’t wait to see more Hange!

Levi and Zeke seemed suspiciously short lived. I think there’s more to Zeke than meets the eye. I’m really starting to think he’s another Owl. I started to question his role when he wasn’t escorted to the pit with Porco and Pieck. 

(Side note: it’s basically confirmed that soldier that trapped them in the pit wasn’t Armin too since he was in the boat. So that was definitely someone else undercover 100%)

And Eren is a damn savage!! It was so badass how he would just pop out and transform again whenever his Titan was done. Definitely shows how much he has been mastering his control. Don’t get me wrong, it was a crazy move using Porco as a Titan nutcracker and I was hyped watching it! But at the same time it felt so inhuman and monster-like to use the Jaw that way to crush the Warhammer. I think its showing how far Eren is willing to go (and probably then some) to do what he feels is just. I kinda wish he would have just taken the Jaw too while he had him but I can’t wait to see how he will use his new Warhammer powers in the next episode!

I also hope poor Reiner gets put out of his misery soon. I feel so bad for the guy!

Very confused with what Eren did in the end. Even though it looked fucking bad ass. I felt Eren is going to follow his father to become a revolutionary for Eledian everywhere but straight up killing them makes me feel he doesn't care about anyone but people living in the walls.

Why did the event take place in interm zone, also I'm pretty sure Magath and Willy knew about Eren being here. References the rat in last episode and Magath not surprised when his people when missing. It is ok for a Titan fight as long as it takes place in Interm zone.

That must be Armin.. there is no other option according to me. Looks taller than Eren tbh was that because of Collosal 😂😂 well even previous Collosal was tall 😂.

Zekes scene with Levi was so weird. He has to be the conspirator behind this attack. They just had to make it seem like Levi killed Zeke, so he can escape with the guys from Paradis.

The Owl probably told Zeke as a child what his role was. He had to turn in his parents, so Grisha would get taken to Paradis. Grisha then inherites the Attack Titan, gives it to Eren who‘s mission is to free all Eldians from the oppression of Marley? On the other hand... Eren did kill many of them. Idk but

Zeke said in episode 2 of this season to Colt, who‘d inherit the Beast titan after him, that Colt would get behind his secret as soon as he‘s the beast titan... yeah, Zeke afterwards said his secret how he wipes his ass, but he probably had his life as a double agent in mind.

It reminds me of Itachis burden. Although Zeke probably hasn‘t that kind of bond with any person from Marley.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NickBooms,"I had this idea in my head after the conversation between Eren and Reiner for ""Declaration of War"" but after this episode with conversations between Falco and Gabi along with Eren and Levi it is now certain: this show is great. I know this is an obvious statement but here me out.

I became a big fan of Game of Thrones and one thing that always stood out is that you cared about the conversations just as much, if not more than, the combat. There was no filler because each scene just added another brick to the path the story was following. Not only that, but you always felt excited when two characters who you know well finally meet, whether it's their first time meeting or it's a long-awaited reunion. 

AOT has become just that. The back-and-forth dialogue between Eren and Reiner showed the regrets Reiner still has along with the undying rage Eren feels. Falco telling Gabi the true reason why their friends died and her ignoring this information shows a dark path in her future if left unchanged. Levi scolding Eren while also filling the viewers in on the fact that no one wanted this to happen leaves even more room for conflict. At this point I don't care if there's an epic showdown, what I want to see is a genuine debate between Eren and Gabi and hopefully a revelation showing that they're really two sides of the same coin. That is why I think this show is great, and it's been a while since I've felt that way about any of the shows I've watched in the past few years.",gljcr9v,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 01:01:55,17,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wing_Fish1302,"I don't usually post on this subreddit (Or Reddit in general), so I preemptively apologize if I make any mistakes. I just wanted to dump my thoughts here.

Haha, what an episode. I put it up there with 'Declaration of War' for favorite episodes of this season. I loved the adrenaline rush of the last few episodes, but episodes like this really make me stick around AoT/SnK. If anything, these types of episodes enhance the action for me.

Unfortunately, I got spoiled on Sasha's death a while back, so it didn't hit as hard, but it was still sad, especially on re-watches (The music and characters' reactions really sell it). 

I'm seeing quite a bit of discussion around Gabi and Eren this time around (For anime-only people, at least). I mean, there was already, but this episode seems to have struck a nerve. Although there is responsibility to go around, I honestly don't really blame anyone. 

Gabi is responsible for pulling the trigger and physically killing Sasha, but I also chalk a good amount of it up to her actions being a product of the environment she's grown up in and a natural reaction for someone in her position to have. Again, she's still responsible, but I personally don't harbor any anger towards Gabi. 

Eren...is complicated. Although a war with Marley seems like it was going to happen either way, Eren chose the battlefield and kicked off this specific sequence of events that led to this specific occurrence of Sasha's death (It can never be truly known whether Sasha would or would not have survived in any other given alternative), but I see her death as being an indirect consequence of Eren's actions. I wouldn't absolve Eren of responsibility, but I wouldn't consider him completely or directly responsible. 

In the end, I don't really blame or feel any anger towards anyone. I just feel sad that Sasha died. Rest in potatoes, Sasha, you will be missed. 

Yet, regardless of who's really to blame and who's not, I feel that one of the important takeaways from this is that, justified or not, some of the Scouts blame Eren and, even more importantly, Eren blames himself. 

Regardless, the hardest part of these types of discussions is that we'll never know what could've happened. We can theorize about what would've happened if Eren didn't decide to launch an attack on Liberio on that day at that time, but we can never truly know what the outcome would've been (Especially for a show that's all about things going wrong). It also doesn't help that we're barely out of the Liberio arc, so we - and the characters - can really only speculate about what the consequences of Eren's actions will be until the anime releases more episodes (Even then, it'll probably be a chaotic, morally grey mess). So, until then, I consider myself pretty neutral in this conflict. 

But back to the episode itself, I think it was very strong. It's so impressive how much can be conveyed through lingering on a character's facial expression. I love how much was said this episode without it actually being said. You can feel the conflict and tension in the air that's been developing over the last four years, even if we haven't yet seen the full extent of what happened during that time. I really look forward to what comes next.

Gosh, I love this show so much. That's probably my adrenaline rush from the last episode talking, but I think Season 4 is off to such a strong start. There are certainly elements I miss from the early episodes/seasons of the show (I do miss when titans were these horrifying, larger-than-life, and unknowable threats, but I absolutely love the direction the show is going in). I also love coming on the AoT and SnK subreddits after each episode to see the memes, art, insightful analyses, and theories that people have. As much as I am tempted to wait until the whole season releases to binge it, the experience after each episode is worth it.",glntcof,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 23:49:23,15,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

One side has concentration camps, a deeply racist population, indoctrinated child soldiers on the front lines, and just held a big ""we declare genocidal war"" rally. The other side has been fighting a desperate war of self-defense against slave soldiers (basically what the mindless titans are, they're sent to attack the walls against their will) and has finally had a chance to strike back at a military target. Yes there were civilian casualties, but the attack targeted the military harbor and the assembly of military brass. That's a hell of a lot less civilian death than Hiroshima but people are perfectly comfortable accepting that attack was justified. 

Like guys. We all agree that the war has hurt innocents on both sides and that is bad. Gabi and the other kids are brainwashed and need rehab not punishment. But let's not pretend that this attack of self-defense by the paradis people puts them anywhere near the marleyans morally.",gljunb3,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 03:25:02,43,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Either way, this was another great episode and this and Assault really remind me of Hero/Midnight Sun. The former is the big exciting climax to the battle while the latter is the quiet but still emotional aftermath. Lots of interesting new developments this episode too, Zeke is in cahoots with Paradise as I expected and Gabi and Falco are hostages. That leaves Marley with Pieck, Galliard, a suicidal Reiner and zero young warrior candidates. How the turn tables.

Going to be completely honest though, and please no one take this the wrong way, I've always thought Sasha felt a bit out of place in the show. She was entertaining and had that cool episode back in Season 2, but other than that I felt like she didn't have the same pathos as the rest of the cast and was just along for the ride. Though maybe that's the point, she was just a random and crazy girl that got caught up in this hectic war and became great friends with those involved. Despite that, it still hurt to see her die and especially everyone's reactions. Even seeing Mikasa and Eren get effected really drove home how devastating a loss this was. R.I.P.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Optimal_Bit_5600,"Damn, two episodes back to back was a treat. I did admittedly cave in and watch the 17 minute version of episode 14 last week, but it was still nice seeing the high quality, full version today along with episode 15.  As for my thoughts, 14 was a great follow up to last episode, giving us the long awaited EMA meeting and rematch between Zeke and Levi. The EMA meeting wasn't as lengthy as I expected, but was still a hard scene to watch due to Eren wrecking both of his best friends either mentally or physically. While I have a sneaking suspicion that Eren is putting up an act and doesn't mean what he's saying, the whole thing with Mikasa being manipulated by some generational brain-washing akin to the Reiss family was a hell of a twist. It's something that retroactively makes Mikasa much more interesting, and fixes my major issue with her in past seasons (being obsessive and over protective of Eren). Kudos to Armin for standing up to Eren too, even if he was no match in a fight. As for Levi vs Zeke, it may not have had the same fluid animation as Imai's action sequences, but much like episode 7 the direction and pacing still carried it. Considering the tight schedule, it turned out better than I expected, and the whole forest sequence was thrilling to watch overall.   


Now as good as 14 was, 15 is another story. This was a phenomenal episode that is right up there with Declaration of War and Assault as being among my favorite episodes this whole season. Genuinely feel really, really bad for Zeke, and while I don't agree at all with his plan, I completely understand where he's coming from. Poor kid had a shitty childhood, with that scene where Grisha was freaking out in the other room actually making me tense up as if I were right there alongside Zeke. It's just one of the many strengths of this story, how much perspective can alter things with this episode and That Day showing two sides of the same coin. And yeah that last scene looked gorgeous, definitely one of the best MAPPA has put out for this adaptation. Only one more episode left until we say goodbye for a bit, interested to see how they leave off this story before we head to the actual final stretch of episodes.",grryl6v,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-22 04:50:18,1,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Gabi and Falco are precisely where Eren, Armin and Mikasa were at the beginning. Having their lives blown apart (figuratively and literally) by these evil creatures.

But now they’re just committing the same evil onto more innocent people. Yes, the Marleyan government is evil. But are MARLIANS evil? Just like Eren and the gang before they found the basement, Marlians only have the information they’ve been given. They genuinely thought Paradis was full of evil people. Willy’s story was a revelation for them. They are just normal people put in a situation where they didn’t have a choice to pick sides, just like Paradis Eldians.

So what makes it ok for Eren and the gang to murder hundreds of them? Nothing. If anything, it’s worse, because they have more information than the everyday Marlian. They knew that the Marlian government was evil, but that Marlians didn’t really know what was going on.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hibiscxs,"I am amazed that Reddit is the place I find the most rational discussion about the episode vs Twitter or Tumblr. The amount of Gabi hate I'm seeing there is crazy. People are seriously wishing death on her as revenge for killing Sasha/cheering for her getting beat up by the Scouts/joking that she should have killed Floch instead.

A lot of people are missing the point in Gabi killing Sasha. It's normal that people are angry about Sasha's death, especially if she was their favorite/ their comfort character. In fact, her death was the best choice for this moment, instead of Floch like I've heard people wishing (I mean, does anyone really *like* Floch?) or any of the other Scouts. Sasha was always the more light-hearted character of the main crew. Her death (and in such a pointless way, too) is a symbol that this final season *is not messing around*. There are no more comfort characters you can count on to smile and joke at the end of all this.

But back to the Gabi hate. Again, it's really understandable why people are mad about Sasha's death, and they need something to direct their anger too. I'm just so confused about how passionately and directly that hate is put to Gabi. 

You shouldn't hate Gabi. Not for killing Sasha, anyway. You can hate her for her personality (she's arrogant, that's for sure), but not for this. Gabi is literally a brainwashed child soldier. We know exactly what Marley feeds the Eldians in terms of Eldian history and the current situation about Paradis Island. We know exactly how the military ropes in their Eldian soldiers with their propoganda. We know that, to Gabi, the Scouts are devils who perpetuate the devilish legacy of the Eldians that Marley continues to use to oppress her people.

Does that justify her actions? Of course not. We know the truth about Marley and Paradis. We know that the people of Paradis aren't devils, and that they have been living in hell for years because of Marley. We know that the girl Gabi just killed wasn't a devil, but a girl who loved meat, who loved her friends, who only wanted to put an end to the hell conditions of Paradis.

But we also know the truth about the Eldians in Marley. We know that they're oppressed and tortured. We know Marley uses them as canon fodder. We know that the Eldians were force fed a nasty and false history that raised them to believe that they deserved the conditions they lived in, and that the only way they could atone for that was to live and kill and die in a war for their oppressors. We know that Eren knows this, and the Scouts probably know it too. We know that Eren and the Scouts just killed countless people who don't know the truth, and who only wanted to be free of their oppression.

There is no right side in the Gabi vs. Sasha situation. There is no right side when the people fighting are the Eldians of Paradis and the Eldians of Marley. They are only two wronged sides in an ugly war waged by Marley.

You should be mad about Sasha's death. It was pointless (not storytelling-wise, but in the context of the war). But the person to blame is not Gabi. The thing to blame is the war, because it's a tragedy. It's a tragedy that Sasha died so fruitlessly, that she had to live the life she did, the one that lead her to join the Scouts and kill monsters and watch her friends die and then kill people. It's a tragedy that the person to do it was Gabi, this kid who thinks she just killed a devil, that she's serving her people, who doesn't know the truth. Maybe she never will. Maybe she'll have lived and killed and died in a war for a country who thought of her as a weapon and never know it. Or maybe she *will* learn the truth, and realize that she killed people for that country, that her friends and family died for that country.

But that's the point of the story-- that there won't be a person like Sasha who comes out the other end smiling and joking. Instead, it'll be a person like Gabi, who might survive and return to Marley, waiting for a reprieve for her people that will never come, who might end up switching sides and fighting the rest of the war against her people who don't know better. Or there won't be anyone coming out on the other side at all.",glkoozx,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 08:20:56,9,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

If he followed the way of life being persecuted as an eladian he would have likely been a doctor with a family and kids. Dina Fritz would have never met him so no Zeke. He would have never inherited the Attack Titan and gone inside the walls and met Carla so Eren. No eren means Mikasa would have likely gone into Child sex trafficking ring and may have ended up in the same place as Levi's mom.

How are they gonna close the series cause the marley revelation is intense. 

I may have to read the manga cause it feels like anime is either leaving stuff out or really summarizing a bunch of stuff. 

Also it was brilliant to make the attack in the eladian. Quarters cause in real life any major attack doesn't happen in the rich areas it's usually the really poor areas.

I wonder why Zeke wouldn’t use this power to transform the Paradisans attacking into Titans? I know this would cause issues for Marley somewhat, including their soldiers that were there. But it seems like he can direct them somewhat, and think about it: a mindless titan Mikasa or Levi or Sasha is much less dangerous to the Marleyans than a trained scout with ODM gear and a plan they’re unaware of. He also could have done this during the suicide run at the end of season 3, all of those soldiers would have been more useful to them as Titans than as fodder right? Maybe there is something I’m missing as I don’t read the manga and this power hasn’t been fleshed out in the anime. Anyways, this leads me to think along the lines of some of the theories I’ve seen: Could Zeke be working with Paradis now? Doesn’t seem like he died when Levi demolished him from behind based on the fact that we didn’t see his physical death, and Eren had the baseball glove with his letters which seemed like a nod to Zeke.

B) Eldian Empire Jaegerists: Liberate all Eldians and fight back against Marley and the rest of the world.  Activate the Rumbling! Kill all our enemies!  Floch and a bunch of nameless characters.  It also includes Eren... unless Eren is lying to the Jaegerists.

C) Paradis Military Old Guard:  We just want to defend Paradis and not start a World War. This is where most of our old characters are still found: Hange, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Pryxis. Is Armin still here?

D) Marleyian Warriors: Fighting for Marley against those island devils.  Take the Founding Titan for the glory of Marley and their cool natural resources too.  Commander Maggath.  Galliard, Probably still Reiner. I'm putting Pieck in here even though she described her motives a little differently, but she's still fighting for Marley. That guy Yelena shot in the head.

People badmouthing Mappa really need a reality check. I never cared much for Sasha until this season, she had her moments before but all of them kinda felt hollow to me. But this season... damn, her synergy (even though it was only a couple of scenes) with Connie and Jean, her badassery as a sniper and her less histrionic characterization really made me like her character a lot more than the previous 3 seasons. Making her death super impactful, especially for the way the characters around her react. Armin and especially Mikasa (whom I really didn't like in earlier seasons) reacting to her death without us hearing their voices makes the whole moment so much more poignant and memorable. It also reminds you that these characters have really been through a hell of a lot together and the 4 years that have passed were spent in each other's company. The fact that Sasha dies without giving us a anime speech to her friends makes the whole scene feel so much more brutal and real.

What would have happened had Eren not attacked was basically the entire rest of the world declaring war on the Island and then going and attacking. A **lot** more people would have died in that war. Most certainly Sasha. 

His attack, with their assistance, got them the Warhammer powers, Zeke, they destroyed Marleys port, caused the death of Tybur and other high ranked Marleyans and they beat up all their Titan warriors. A first attack that cost 8 lives, gave them a key to overall victory and set their opponent back BIG. 

What I'm left wondering is what's the end game? What's going on with the important person who met with Tybur then left and him knowing he was going to die? Story wise it seems likely Eren will unleash the ""Rumbling"" aka turn the walls back into Titans who then run over the world killing everything. But is that the end? Does the series end with our main character and the ""good guys"" we rooted for killing everyone else on Earth in order to win? I'm not saying I'm against that, creatively it's powerful and gutsy.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirUlrichVonLichten,"- God damn, I really thought Pieck had switch sides.

- Armin's reaction to the Euthanization plan....was strange. I thought there would be more pushback on the plan. I mean the plan is really fucked up. They want to wipe out an entire race. And I know they are doing it because they believe it's the only way to stop the Eldian Suffering, but still. Will be interesting to see what the other characters think. Jean was the only one that showed any kind of push back to the idea. 


- I still don't believe that Eren is all in on Zeke's plan. I like that Jean even brought up the idea that Eren was faking all that shit. I'm gonna hold on to this. I got to! No way after everything our boy Eren hates Mikasa and Armin. No way he's really on Zeke's side. I gotta believe he wants to fuck Zeke over. I also like the idea that Armin was pretending to be emotional over the plan. 


- What. A. Cliffhanger.


- Thank god we are getting a part 2 and not a movie.


- It's going to be so hard to stay anime-only, but I got to do it. I've made it this far. Reading the manga now would feel like a betrayal. But mannnnn, I really want to.


- Overall, this season fucking incredible and cemented Attack on Titan as one of my favorite works of fiction. The wait for Part 2 is going to be brutal.",gsmq7i9,mf43si,attackontitan,2021-03-29 01:24:12,53,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

* I  long held onto the theory that Zeke was playing the Long Con and was on  Paradis Island's side. Looks like it was true! I'm fascinated to know  more of Zeke's story and why his allegiance is the way it is.
* Banter between Zeke and Levi was perfect.
* I'm  absolutely gutted about Sasha. The moment Gabi made it onto the  aircraft, I knew someone important was going to bite it. I thought it  was going to be Jean. Everyone's reaction to her death was  heartbreaking, but especially Eren since he knows it's his fault. For  all his stoic face stuff this seaosn, Eren is still Eren on the inside  and Sasha's death definitely hit him. Man.

* Well  the conversation between Eren, Armin, and Mikasa was so heartbreaking  and tough to watch. Just all the things Eren was saying to each of them.  So cold. Part of me wonders if he really meant, or if there is some  other long con going on here? Or at the very least it was harder for him  to say then he let on. But to be honest, it didn't seem that hard.  Eren....he's just completely gone now. I love his transformation, but  god damn is it heartbreaking.
* I loved seeing Armin fight back though.
* ""We've never fought before have we? It's because it's not even a close fight!"" What a brutal moment.
* Levi  being forced to take out all his comrades. so brutal...yet still  badass. Levi is now 3-0 against Zeke. Even if the second fight was  staged. Something about watching Levi beat the shit out of Zeke.
* The  scene where the Jaegerists force the cadets to beat up the old Scout  trainer. Is there a better scene that encapsulates how far and how  different AoT is now? Back in season one, things were so much more  innocent(relatively speaking). Something like that would never have  happened back then. It was a great way to show how far gone things are. I  just love how this show constantly makes you re-examine the way things  use to be.
* So  glad we learned more about Zeke's backstory and his motivations. And  now we've gotten a bigger picture into what Zeke and Eren are planning.  Holy shit man.",grr3moh,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-22 00:13:29,86,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

The cute photos that the Panzer Unit had of Pieck and the team in their little section on the Cart Titan’s armour. Little nigh inconspicuous Details like that really hammer in the loss of humanity. 

When Falco was trying to save Piëck she told him to leave her and save herself. It’s kind of funny and ironic how arguably the most kind hearted and (IMO) the prettiest and most genteel warrior has the creepiest looking Titan. 

The general looks of relief and admiration the soldiers had when they saw the Beast Titan enter the battlefield. Despite being Eldian, the warriors (especially Zeke) actually commanded a fair amount of respect from the Marleyan military. 

I’m drawing a lot of parallels between Pieck and Armin. In terms of tactical planning and leadership skills.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,honneypot,"My thoughts on this episode:

\-So much has probably happened to them during this time skip

\-Sasha and Armin look so different like the life was sucked out of them, Sasha looks so much more mature 

\-Jean seems to be the same but matured as well, when he hesitated shooting Pieck because of Falco, that reminded me of when he hesitated shooting that person as Eren was being kidnapped and Armin saved him. Pieck now got to live because he hesitated

\-It was so sad seeing Pieck's squad get shot, it's not often you get to see both sides of a war 

\-Zeke was defo acting super suspicious in this episode, "" we are running out of time Levi"" ... and Levi with the clock, mans just stood there and let himself get shot down easily by Levi... very suspicious indeed..

\-Porco was seriously underestimating the scouts... it is crazy how Marley easily won the war against that nation using the power of the titans. But, for Paradis, the only enemy they fought is Titans, all their life,  that's all they've known. So, it isn't surprising to see that they are so advanced fighting titans compared to Marley 

\-a lot of people commented on the soundtrack and how it was ""lacking"" but I personally found it fine, it was fitting and appropriate. The anime is a completely different vibe from the first 3 seasons so the soundtrack is not going to be the same.",gkncidg,l42oc2,attackontitan,2021-01-25 00:27:47,4,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

I'll support Eren through and through. Marley wanted a war, they were ready for a war but when they sent female, jaw, armoured and colossal titan to paradis island to get the founding titan people weren't ready, they didn't even know what was going on, they were at a disadvantage. Marleyans keep calling Eldians from paradis island demons but they fail to see that THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MADE THEM THE WAY THEY ARE.

It draws attention to the theme Isayama has been reinforcing time and time again that mere determination isn't going to trump strategy and tactics in war. It's even more satisfying this time around since Mikasa catches Porco in titan form by surprise, highlighting the fact that just like Titans were a terrifying beast in the first few seasons, now it's the Paradis Eldians who are picking apart the Marleyans with the same ease. 

Other parallels to draw between these two scenes is how they pay an uncomfortable amount of attention to Armin and Eren slipping inside the titan's mouth in S1 and Lara Tybur's remains falling into Eren's mouth in this most recent episode.",gkpkty3,l42oc2,attackontitan,2021-01-25 15:36:59,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Some thoughts

1. Eren - Porco - Lara scene was just brutal and satisfying at the same time. Am I wrong to think this way? But I just don’t love the scene, I love how Eren grew from being crybaby to a full-grown titan. He’s well-trained now, and he’s come prepared.
2. Armin’s eyes when he saw the massive count of dead bodies on his weight. They’re full of regret. Armin is still our old Armin but more badass.
3. Sasha’s scenes are always short but they’re always FIRE. Such a long-range shooter!
4. I believe in Ackerman Supremacy only. Levi and Mikasa. Oh man. No words.
5. Zeke. I gotta tell you there’s more going on with Zeke, Levi, Paradis Island. His “death” was shown too quickly I’m not sure he was killed or he just disappeared. Looks to me as if he’s having an escape plan with Levi. I don’t know it’s just me but let’s find out. 
6. “Don’t die. Survive til the end.” My sweet Levi.
7. The whole scout I am so happy they’ve grown, they’re well-equipped, they know what they’re doing. Rooting for them always.

There was also that wiretap scene in a previous episode when he said something and that he wouldn't want to discuss it ""in this room"". What does he have to hide from the Marleyan officers?

And that line he said. The subbed version I watched translated it as ""Eren is no match for me"" but I'm fairly sure he said something along the lines of ""エレンは俺の的じゃない"" which could also be taken to mean ""Eren is not my enemy"".... Maybe he was just saying that he was looking to defeat Levi instead, but idk it just seemed a bit off to me... especially considering everything else I've noticed so far.

Then again, what possible motive could he have for aiding the people of Paradis Island? It's very likely that I'm looking too much into it, but I guess it's just something to think about.

Due to trauma and two sided propaganda dude just believes erasing Eldians by preventing them from reproducing will solve the problem of Eldians. Well that’s good and all that but here’s my personal feelings. 

That’s a LAZY solution to such a problem. Just like we **don’t** say “let’s kill every women because they will be eventually sexually assaulted at some point in their lives and killing them while they are babies will save them from that pain.” Or just like when we **dont** say “We should kill all the black people because they are suffering unimaginable amounts of racism and only killing them will stop it”. We also shouldn’t be okay with “Let’s kill Eldian race by murdering their mojo”. Because that’s not a solution at all. In contrary this kind of a goal is working in favor of powers which are currently causing the suffering of Eldians. There is a cause and effect here.

Well I've got another theory that may be supported by those other theories.

What is it? Well if Zeke really isn't dead and it's working with the scouts he may also get eaten by Eren, how?!, Well think back to the baseball glove scene, it has nothing to do with Zeke, the beast titan is best known for its throwing abilities so Eren having a baseball and a glove means he's trying to get better at throwing and in case he does eat Zeke he won't have to learn how to throw in case the time comes where he needs to use the beat titan. 

Why would Zeke want to get eaten? He has a year left is he is really betraying Marley he has to get eaten by someone from paradis and why not by his own brother?  its perfect foreshadowing!

Could it be that he disguised himself and tried to protect porco and pieck while also taking them out of the battle because he knew what was about to go down? Also he would probably be one of the only ones who was aware of that trap door room clearly built for titans. There’s no way eren and the gang could have built that or discovered it.

That’s my vote! It was zeke who led them away and shaved his beard + lowered his helmet  and disguised his voice so they wouldn’t recognize him.",gkretxr,l42oc2,attackontitan,2021-01-25 23:47:50,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

1) Marley government knew something- they had a very strong and alert military standing by for a play/announcement on their own soil...

2) Pieck/Cart might have told the panzers unit ""follow us"" or ""check on us"".
The panzer guy was ""shocked"" a little more than just getting a hug from a sexy heroine...(in the next week's trailer we see Cart and Jaw standing on the street as opposed to  the grass floor of dungeon)- Panzer tossed down a rope i'm thinking.

3) In the beginning, Annie and Bert were discussing the old man wanting to be judged, then they cut to Reiner who wanted Eren to judge him...just an observation..

4) Asian lady IMO, Ackerman, She had an A on her back and says ""clan"" to Willy, previous cut info bump stated Levi, Mikasa, and Kenny are all Ackerman with ""related ?"" and states: they can call on inner power/rage and can't be brainwashed.

5) I'm going with Arimin for the guard, Zeke was too relaxed through the whole ordeal and told deliberately by guard to go somewhere else, with no question or suspicion by Zeke. Is he that laid back? He definitely in the know IMO..

6) Willy trying to get countries to help do what Marley couldn't.
Remember, they tried to kidnap the founding Titan when it was still in Royal peace-keeping possession, so yeah he left that out.

Funny to me: Eren: ""it's cool Reiner, you were a brainwashed child following orders"". Reiner: ""Yeah, but i kind went out my way to get thousands of innocent people killed and your mom too""...",gixg8hk,kuhrxr,attackontitan,2021-01-11 22:27:31,9,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,that80skid,"I’ve been rewatching this episode and especially that ending scene. Two take always.

1) Eren is still emotional or at least driven by the emotions of his younger self. We makes Reiner admit that he killed his mom and attacked them. And the way Eren throws it all right back into his face. Even the last words Eren uses are personal between him and Reiner. “I’ll keeping moving forward. Until I destroy all my enemies.” Make no mistake Eren internally is still emotional, he’s just not expressing those emotions the same way.

2) It’s terrifying how deadpanned / unemotional Eren is about the whole exchange with Reiner is. He comes off as cold and detached yet he’s discussing personal things with Reiner. Also was he clenching his fist so hard out of anger that made him bleed? He says he vaguely forgot about it threatening to kill Reiner and his people. I don’t believe he did forget about it. I think he understands how complicated it all is. He seems to have made up his mind and come to terms with his situation. Where as Reiner doesn’t (yet?) have that resolve. Reiner still has some compassion and sympathy. I can’t say the same (yet?) for Eren.

MAPPA continues to kill it with the production of these episodes. My favorite episodes so far.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BenCannibal,"I've actually picked up AoT after about 5 years, I finished Season 1 back then and didn't watch it again because of delays etc but now I've watched every episode start to finish in 2 weeks.

I think one of the biggest tells of Eren's speech is how in S1 or 2 Mikasa talks about how she used to ignore the cruelty of the world, where she's with her mum in the garden and an insect is devouring another one, and where Eren saves her from the kidnappers and convinces her she has to fight or die. You think it's just a heartwarming story of survival up until this episode.

Then you realise it's not just a defensive thing, that whole mindset prepared them for this point where they needed to do the evil deed for survival. If they just said to Reiner ""I forgive you this war will end"" but with the speech everyone in the world would have taken the side of the speaker and agreed to invade Paradis so it's inevitable.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingBowser64,"So far I haven’t seen anyone mention the conversation with Annie’s father. He seems determined that Annie is alive still. Annie was literally around up until the end of season 1. We now only get her through flashbacks. 
That scene just sat...odd with me. I am curious if it is bait for the audience to believe that Annie will be coming back, but in reality, she’s dead. I doubt she’d be willing to be helpful (her personality) if she came out of the crystal, so I feel like maybe Eren ate her in the crystal... I don’t know, but that scene just felt strange and like bait.

Also, in the teaser for next week: Udo is “helping” someone on his right that was smashed by a rock. The two people on his right (from where they were sitting for the performance): Gabi (middle) and Zophia (furthest to the right)
Either Gabi and/or Zophia got destroyed by a boulder. I originally thought that it was Zophia that was smashed. It would make sense because Zophia is less important than Gabi and she is sort of a background character, but that’s why I think that Gabi was killed instead. Gabi is hyped up to be the best, which is why she is thought to be the next Armored Titan. The Armored Titan is supposed to be either Gabi or Falco. Falco wants to save his love interest Gabi, so he wants to become the Armored Titan. What if Gabi is killed by the “evil island devil” Eren? That would cause a fire of hatred to explode within Falco (whom was shown to be questioning the motives in that one train scene with Reiner) towards the people of Paradise. Falco would get the Armored Titan and would be full of hate and anger. I feel like it would be more boring and “expected” for Zophia to die, so that is precisely why I feel it is Gabi that was at least crushed. 

Tldr; My guesses from this episode after watching it twice and pausing way too many times: Annie is dead. Eren ate Annie. Gabi was crushed by a boulder. Falco will become the Armored Titan and will hate all people of Paradise.

The whole chain of events for this series hinges on Marley sending out Titans for over a hundred years and then eventually send the 4 human titans in a mission to steal the Founding Titan.  If the Tybur family already knew that the King wanted to remain peaceful, then what reason did they have for doing any of this?  I could maybe see how the reason for attacking wall Maria was an effort to stop Grisha Yeager's mission to take the Founding Titan, but even that seems unlikely given that its unlikely that Marley would know of Grisha's plan, and it has been stated that Marley attacked Wall Maria to lure out the King.

In the end Eren saying he and Reiner were the same wasn't him putting aside their differences so they could work together, it was just him saying that he understood why he did it now and accepted that he's no better than him. I was really hoping that Eren and Reiner would convince everyone that the people on the island weren't the devils they'd been taught they were, of course that would have been more underwhelming because there would have been a lot less action but idk, I was really just hoping for a happy ending because there are characters that I like on both side of the conflict and the whole thing has just been caused by false information, if everyone could take the time to understand each other they'd realize there's no need to fight at all, its just tragic that so many people are going to die over basically a misunderstanding. Everyone in this show has been through so much and it'd be nice for things to start looking up in the end but now I cant see how it could end without one side being completely eradicated. Also, even though Reiner feels incredibly guilty, I still cant see him choosing to fight against Marley, where his own family is, if it comes down to either destroying Marley or Paradis, so it's unlikely I'll see Eren and Reiner team up like I was hoping for. It's getting hard for me to root for anyone in this show at this point, I still really like the characters and understand their motivations but i still just cant root for someone who's goal is to wipe out entire nations of people.

I genuinely felt so so bad for him because I never truly believed he was evil to begin with, I was just waiting for the story to reveal his actual ideals so I had sympathy for Zeke yet I also obviously understood Levi‘s standpoint. 

The further this season progresses the more I feel detached from our scouts and closer to Eren and Zeke. I trust in Eren and I think people really don’t give him enough credit this man is smarter than y’all think he knows d has experienced things beyond anybody’s imagination. Hanji and Armin on the other hand just can’t let go of their morals and beliefs and hopes for some kind of change in the greater scheme of things. Hoping everyone can become friends again but in that they are limiting themselves and causing more damage in the long run. 

They simply are not ready to make the sacrifices that Eren is preparing himself to make in order to end this cycle and progress. 

I do feel bad for them because Eren is not giving them any answers or hints that he still is the same person they grew up with. 

Anyway I don’t know how Eren is going to solve all of this because I really hope he is not going to kill off all Eldians but find some kind of loop hole to make everyone survive in sone shape or form.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I_am_Feli,"My theory:

Willy Tybur or SOMEONE within the Tybur family is working with Eren and they planned out to have this whole speech and everything to make him look like the bad guy, for the Marleans (and the rest of the world) to understand and FEEL what the Eldians on Paradis had to go trough, so that with the help of the Kiyomi (forgot her last name, the japanese woman) they can break the cycle so to speak and end the ongoing war and back and forth between the Eldians and everyone else, the Marleans specially.

Remember, the asians (or just japanese, not sure) and the Ackermanns can not be controlled by the founding Titan. King Fritz was not able to brainwash them. They KNOW something!

The story Willy Tybur told everyone today, is NOT the FULL truth! There is still something hidden within the whole Royal Family meaning BOTH Tyburs and King Fritz! 

It looks like Kiyomi is on Willy Tyburs side and the Tyburs are against Eren but I think all 3 are working together! They ALL know there is a key part missing that was not told to the public.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IustinKing,"Disclaimer: I didn't read any manga, so everything I think will happen is all from my little imagination.

SO, where do we start:

\-The moment Eren transforms: EPIC. What can I say? When I saw yellow particles I said in my mind: ""This is gonna be AWESOME!"". I think Eren's eye in close up must be some kind of message. Why did his eye shine blue? Is there any meaning behind it? We will see in future episodes I guess  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

\-The Jaw Titan and the Cart Titan got ""captured""(more trapped I guess). This event isn't ***THAT*** important, but the thing that got me fired up is Armin. Like, dude, is Armin. And not any Armin...... Colosal Titan Armin, after 4 years of having it's power. And btw, nice beard he got there! D:

\-Zeke. What the hell is Zeke doing? Eren planned the attack (probably), and trapped Falco and Pieck, BUT what about Zeke? I know he is more of a ""long range"" Titan, by using his powerfull throws, but for real, where is he, and what will he do about an Angry Eren killing hundreds of people? 

\-One more thing about Eren. I'm surprized how much he ""evolved"". Like you could see that he mastered controlling his super fast regeneration and he got wiser. I say this because, he didn't do anything stupid. I mean, old Eren ( like season 3 Eren) would have just punched Reiner to death in that underground room. Instead, season 4 Eren had a *conversation* with him. That line:  ""I just keep moving forward""  , was just GENIUS.

That's pretty much it about what i wanted to say about this episode.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kollarb,"So after rewatching all the tall soldier scenes and pausing on the frame that shows his face, I was thinking who the hell that might be. I think I got it. 

I want to state that I am an anime watcher only, I know nothing about the manga, I wouldn’t act as I know nothing for some internet points, I just want to talk about my theory. But if it’s correct then this could be a major plot point and it could ruin the surprise. So please stop reading if you want to go in blind. Maybe I am wrong, but now that I think about it, it’s quite obvious.

So I think the soldier is indeed Armin... and Annie.
The soldier is very tall so if we assume that a shifter phisically changes if they acquire a titan then that would explain that it is Armin because he ate Bertholt and grew in size.
Also Armin has blonde hair, the shape of the face is kinda similar, the voice is weird but it could have gotten deeper over 4 years.

So why do I think it isn’t that simple?
Two things: Pieck recognized him, and the shot where we see his face. Also kinda the fake beard, but maybe he can’t grow one, big deal.

The biggest clue for me are the long eyelashes. They are VERY feminine. That’s when I suspected Annie but all the other factors are pointing towards Armin.

So I think Armin ate Annie and got the Female titan from her. It would explain everything. That’s why he has these feminine eyes, that’s why he can’t grow a beard and that’s why Pieck recognized him (Pieck only saw Armin as a burnt body).

I really don’t know why Armin would eat Annie if he already possesses the Colossal but I guess we will find out.

I thought about the Tybur family doing a propaganda play to further make it seem like the paradies island eldians are the enemies since there was a scene in the trailer with Willy bowing down on a stage and in early S4 someone saying to contact Willy for smth.

Eren and Rainer's exposition had me sitting there with goosebumps! It was an absolute hell of a rollercoaster ride to see how Rainer just breaks down in front of him. I'm wondering what happens to Rainer. Will he switch sides, as he wanted to kill himself already because his only friends, paradies eldians, were gone (at that moment in time) and the only friends he had are all dead or missing except for Zeke and the other shifters and his family. Or is he just going to die/be a pawn in Armin's plan for what happens after.

Everything would have been avoided and I am totally on erin's side, they were going to attack them anyways then fuck em up bro.

Edit: actually i am not sure who to side with now that i thought about it again. I mean Eldian was at fault from the very start and for 700 years have been fucking Marley until they exploited it and gave them what they deserve and now they try acting all innocent and a coward part of them escaped or ended the war like king fritz who was soo good and kind didn't do shit these 700 years and when they started losing he is like nah i aint about these wars. I change my mind I am siding with Marley empire however I don't agree with them colonize other Empire's like Slava but that's how the world works.

Another edit: why did Ymir make a deal with the devil in the first place i misunderstood and thought it was because marley was colonizing them if thats the cause then i would be on eldian's side though its unfair and sinful however its not their fault its ymir's fault. They just happened to get the power it's not like they agreed and i guess that would be a great sacrifice of her but not acceptable.

Another edit: let me get this stright eren's missions was suppost to be him colonizing marley avenging eldians that are enslaved by marley but eren considers eldian his hometown so he will take revenge on both marley and eldins because those enslaved eldians hate the eldian empire anyways and thought the eldian empire betrayed them therfor they marley attacks eldian empire using eldians they slave like reiner ,bertold and annie EVEN FUCKING THOUGH GRISHA'S PLAN IS TO FREE THE SLAVED ELDIANS BECAUSE HE WAS A SLAVED ELDIAN BUT EREN IS NOT FROM THE SLAVED ELDIANS AHHHHHHHHHHHHH i mean it's the fathers fault for not teaching him who is his real town

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,curtismannheim,"So here are my speculationis about the future, based on some of the things from this episode and the past events.

&#x200B;

I don't buy that Eren will go along with Zeke's plan, and here are my arguments:

1. Making it so no more Eldians can be born is to give up. Eren does not give up, especially not on the freedom he's been fighting for his whole life.  Just remember season 1, when Armin is trying to get Eren to close the breach in Trost:

Armin: ""Why do we fight? What is the reason that makes us go outside the walls?""

Eren: ""Because this world is our birthright""

Sterilizing the entire nation, in Eren's eyes, would be do deny that birthright, the same thing the titans that he hated his whole life were doing. The same thing the royal family did by erasing Eldians' memories - denied the people's freedom to choose for themselves. Eren always fights for freedom, and urges everyone else to do the same. I don't think I need to remind you how many times he said the word ""fight"" for the  entirety of the show. 

2. In this episode Jean points out that Eren wouldn't hurt Mikasa without a reason (that scene was painful to watch btw). When Mikasa and Armin hear this they have a ""hey, waitaminit, he's got a point, maybe he's onto something"" kinda face. And, of course, before we get any of the characters' thoughts or speculations on this, they get interrupted. 

That is further proof, but from the meta point of view. I think most people know that this is how anime leave the breadcrumbs for us to follow. The same thing happened in season 2 when Reiner caught that Ymir can read Marleyan writings. That scene too, spanned just a couple of seconds, and got immediately interrupted by the titan attack. I believe the same is happening in this episode.

3. At the end of season 3 Eren asks if they would be free if all their enemies on the other side are killed. He says the same in his conversation with Reiner - ""I'll just keep moving forward, untill I've killed my enemies"". And in the previous episode again, when he talks about how Berthold is taking over Armin's mind, he says: ""An enemy within you that is in love with another enemy"". He still referred to Berthold and Annie as enemies. I think you can connect the dots.

In conclusion, based on our knowledge of who Eren is, going with Zeke's plan is completely out of character for him. Whatever his plan is, I don't believe he will do this. But then again, we didn't get Eren's own perspective on all of this in this season practically at all. All we have is other people's accounts and opinions on what he's got in his head. So there is still a possibility that he's changed. HOWEVER, such change would need to be justified hard, and I mean HARD. Literally, I think the only way he'd do this if he got some cosmic vision through his future seeing powers that there is no other way, because that's the only way you get someone as stubborn and driven as eren to break, and eve that is a stretch.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wolfpac187,"This show is elite.

I've been waiting for Eren to sit down and talk with Armin and Mikasa and it didn't disappoint at all. I think there's a possibility that Eren didn't mean what he said to Mikasa and only did it to seperate them from himself, but at the same time he's permanently ruined his relationship with his old friends. And watching poor Armin catch those hands was wild.

Levi is the GOAT but at this point he's made Zeke his bitch. He's bodied Zeke twice and I feel like when they fight for the third time it's gonna be Zeke's turn to get a W, and I don't think he's gonna keep Levi alive sadly. Besides that I was hype to see Zeke finally die.

Floch is trash and is in my top three most hated along with Rod Reiss and that dude that killed Grisha's sister and turned Dina into a Titan (forgot his name).

Yeah I wasn't hype to see Zeke die after ""Sole Salvation"" I don't think I've ever changed my mind about a character so quickly. He's done some of the most horrible shit in the show but at the same time seeing what his parents put him through was honestly disgusting. By the end I was hoping Levi wouldn't kill him.

I don't fully understand Zeke's plan of wiping out Eldians and why Eren is going along with it but maybe he's not and he's just waiting to turn on Zeke. Makes sense considering how happy Zeke was when Eren teamed up with him since Eren is loving breaking peoples hearts lately.

Before these episodes I've predicted that Eren will die by either Mikasa or Levi's hands but now I don't think Mikasa is even capable and I don't see Levi making it that far. I think it'll be Reiner or Gabi.",grvxg0d,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-23 03:43:07,3,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

* Armin seems to agree with Zeke a whole damn lot considering he cried after hearing their plan.

I'm struggling to see genuine conflict, I believe Pieck & Jaw are no match for Eren (Even before he had the warhammer) and I also believe Reiner is no where near a match for Eren on a 1v1 anymore (also before he had WH Titan)...

Eren can transform 3 times with moderate stamina at the 3rd while getting surprise fucked by the War hammer, Cart and Jaw, so now he has WH and completely composed on home soil i could easily see him quickly dispatch Jaw, possibly cart (how would she even get out of the shackles that fast) and solely focus on Reiner and the army...

and that is all without even talking about Eren having the ability to take out the blimps with WH's range attacks AND Having Mikasa with an army of 3DM Soldiers AND Having Armin on back up AND Possibly having Levi turn up (please no spoilers)...

This leads me to the conclusion of concern, I feel like its almost 100% certain the show is going to pull something out of its ass to Balance the fight (My biggest fear is Levi being wounded \[so the shows most OP character can't end the season early\] and not turning up for any of these fights)

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Harpzeecord,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a HUGE AOT fan (as evidenced by my A4 size Levi tattoo which you can see on my profile). But I think the end of this seasons especially has fallen into the trap of becoming too complicated for its own good. 

I know they're going for mind blowing plot twists but ""the brightest star is all the more glorious for it's brevity"" and at this point with all the betrayals and side switchings nothing shocks anymore so surprises lose their impact. 

I think they've also taken the whole ""everyone has their own cause, which they believe to be good"" and ""there are only losers in war"" narrative a little too far and are pushing it v hard with quite in your face examples. 

Don't get me wrong I've loved this season, I just think it's getting a bit muddied down and stalling (especially with the entire penultimate episode being Zeke back story). The first half was so intense you could barely breathe and now it's really slowed to a crawl, albeit the Levi Vs Zeke pt3. 

Also not knowing who to root for and by extension if the MC's motivations are true (does Eren support euthanasia, does he hate Mikasa etc) instills so much doubt to the point where any shock plot twists with MC motivations you just instinctively go ""probably a bluff, nah can't see that happening"". This combined with constant twists and turns makes it hard to get behind the plot and build momentum with it. 

Still loved the season just think it's definitely not as perfect as people say.",gsmhgau,mf43si,attackontitan,2021-03-29 00:05:17,7,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thegoodmanhascome,"I see a lot of theories about how eren will escape this. I haven’t read the manga, and only started watching the show a few months ago, so my predictions are either totally off (95% chance) or mostly on the money (1%) and then partly right (4%). But hey, I’ve gotten done weird predictions right before and so far. But there are a lot of details and nuances in this show which I’ve not noticed/thought about. Any way, mild caution at the remote possibility that I’m right about any of this. 

 I don’t think this is a matter of escape. 

I think Eren’s plan is to eat each of the other titans, and I think that’s what we’ll see here. I think he’s going to eat all of them, including Armin and Zeke, to bring together all of the Titans into one vessel again, like Ymir’s Titan. Like Thanos, it will have costed him everything. 

I think that in this battle in the beginning of part 2, I think that we are not only going to see Eren win, but succeed in getting three more titans added to his repertoire. Leaving only Annie, Zeke and Armin left. 

I also do not buy for a second that eren wants to euthanize everyone. He plans on starting this “rumbling” thing, and killing everyone except eldians. He wants to redeem his father more than anything. Unless I’m totally wrong and he only wants justice for his mother. In which case, he will euthanize everyone. 

We know that if Eren touches Zeke, he would have the founding titan’s ability. What if eren ate him? If he got his powers that way, that would leave only Annie, and Armin standing in the way to protect her. They will most likely move Annie outside of the city, and Armin will feel safe to bring out his titan. Then Levi and Mikasa will probably swoop in and almost kill Eren. But fail. 

Now here’s the thing. Based on what I’ve seen of this creator, there is going to be a concrete ending. And there is a grand purpose for why this story is being told now, and not later on. If Eren is defeated, then that leaves the possibility that someone else will do this in the future. If he does the Zeke euthanizing thing, I guess it ends, but it could still be reversed, by Historia or her baby. If he goes on a global genocide, that’s really the only way it’s all over. It’s a sad ending, but this is the anti hero that Eren has become. It would be an extremely controversial ending, and would absolutely spark HUGE interest in the show. I don’t know, just my thoughts.. then there’s the instant self destruct commands he could send to all eldians. So I don’t know. 

Either way, I think he’s going to have this dilemma, which I only see as a possibility if he has all 9 titans.",gsqwaz3,mf43si,attackontitan,2021-03-30 02:04:15,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Peowulf,"I used to think the show wanted to say something about control and protectionism against outside unknown forces and the like.

But this episode did something very specific to me, during a scene in two parts. It's about the story that both his grandfather and his father read to Zeke. These are two completely opposing stories regarding the same incident and both are considered history by the people that believe each side. Credible, objective and factual history. And that goes for knowledge in general.

And then large groups of people take two polar opposite narratives for granted, they create friends and enemies. The power but also the danger of this dichotomy lies in the fact that the stories believed by each side are black and white. The fact that there is no grey, leaves no room for compromise and trust and also deepens the animosity. This is also very very true in real life, in countries' and nations' relations but also in the relations between smaller groups of civilians.

After all this, of course the ones that are damaged the most are the future generations, the children that are born into communities of hatred against the opposing side.

* Poor Mikasa and Armin. They love Eren so much and to see and hear him tell Mikasa that he's always hated her, then have Eren mess up Armin... So sad. There's some debate about Eren having a tear in his eyes in that last scene, but it could just be reflection. Maybe I'm hoping it was a tear :(
* I wonder if what Eren said about the Ackerman's simply locking onto protecting someone is true. I need to rewatch that scene. I think if it is true that that was truly what led Mikasa to protect Eren, I also don't think it necessarily would invalidate her feelings and love for him.
* Y'all... I hate Floch. I think I dislike him more than any character on the show.
* Also, KEITH!!! I don't know if he died?!!?!? But if he did what a tragic way for him to go -- his story revolves around constantly being proven he's not good or 'special' enough, and here comes Floch completely undermining his leadership/that under Eren and Jaegerists is better than his leadership, and making all of Keith's cadets turn on him. 
* Zeke's backstory was painful. Feels kinda raw and real to what children of any extremism can go through. Those scenes of him being torn apart by Grisha's disapproval and disappointment was too freakin real 
* LEVI. Oh my GOD. So much loss. He already feels like he's bearing the weight of his choices saving Eren and helping him become who he turned out to be... And to top it off, he said yes to his cadets to bring that wine along. Yet another heavy loss that he feels is his fault. Just wanna hug him.
* OK BUT ALSO I was SCREAMING at Levi to just kill Zeke. I know the Beast should get passed down strategically but GOD I was over it hahaha 
* LEVI BETTER NOT BE DEAD, but also I don't think he is???? I truly think if a character as main and powerful as Levi gets killed, he will get a grand and epic death and farewell. But maybe not... Idk, you never know with Isayama haha

Eren is clearly lying out of his ass. He deeply cares for Mikamin.

Given that eren has always yearned for true freedom, there's no way in hell that he has actually agreed to Zeke's plan.

I always thought Mikasa as badass as she is is one of the weakest written characters on the show - single mindedly fixated on protecting Eren while he treats her with contempt - I always thought it was one of the more meh parts of the show.

First of all, where is all this mass brain washing going on to convince every single Eldyan that they are lesser and need to atone for something they had nothing to do with? Humans don't just wake up and think ""ah shit guess I'm part of the trash race."" There is one underground organisation that's only half convinced but I haven't seen a single non-paradise Eldyan that thinks they are normal humans. So where is it happening? Even places like North Korea have defectors that realise their country is lying to them even though they are fed propaganda about how evil the west is from the moment they are born. Are Eldyans just genetically fucking stupid?

Mikasa's brain washing isn't much better. I seriously doubt you could train a 5 year old to be a murderer for their entire life to the point where they physically cannot control themselves when some triggers happen.

And all that is making all their plans really fucking stupid. They have SO much power in their hands with the titans and yes they also deeply despise the titans but you have so many options. You could kill all the Marleans, you could force them into an agreement, you could work with other countries. But no, the ""plan"" they have is to kill themselves, sterilise their entire race, or probably stop whatever it is that makes Eldyans into titans.

Sure, the military would have found it suspicious for him to transform inside a city, but that seems like a small price to pay to accomplish his life-long objective.

If we take someone like Armin, I feel like he could have understood the rationale behind erasing the Eldian to end the cycle of hatred and protect the world ; but at the same time, he would probably react similarly to Kaya, with the (quite understandable) discourse that ""the people in the wall didn't do anything wrong, why must be punished"".

That's what I found interesting: we can say that the people living in the wall have generally led better lives than the Eldian in Marley (except maybe the Scouts). That's why they would probably see Zeke's plan as unjust toward them. But to Zeke, Eren, and Ms.Ksaver, ending the lives of Eldian is not a punishment but a mercy, because in the world that they know, living as an Eldian means suffering.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skyclad__Observer,"Genuinely very impressed by this episode. The CGI was a little weird in parts, but they actually used it to make some really impressive high-speed action that I just don't think would have been possible in 2D. To me 3D shouldn't be used unless it can justify its inclusion, and MAPPA looks to be doing that so far. The environment design and background art are both incredible, I think this might be my new favorite art style aside from Season 2. The color palette too is a big step away from WIT's brighter/sharper choices, but it worked phenomenally well in Slava, and contributed to the feeling that this was an actual battlefield. Another thing I noticed was a few decent moments of character animation, which is relieving because I was worried there might be *too* many static conversations. Hope they can keep it up. I was glad to hear at least one old track as part of the music, but the newer stuff worked well for this particular episode even if it was a bit different than Sawano's usual stuff. Sound design was great too, with the constant sounds of war in the background. 

Directing was good as well, even though this episode wasn't directed by Hayashi. Well paced both in terms of dialogue and action, and some interesting shot composition here and there as well. I especially loved the aerial shots of Fort Slava, the silhouetted shot of the Mid-East forces walking back and forth on the walls, the POV cut of the Mid-East soldier mowing down Eldians with that machine gun, and the shots leading up to the drugged Eldians being thrown off the airship.",gevlyet,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 22:44:57,16,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skyclad__Observer,"K I N O

I thought it was pretty much perfect. They did a fucking incredible job in building up the tension throughout the episode, exactly as I was hoping for. I think the things that stood out to me the most were actually the moments of silence, where they gave certain moments just enough room to breath. There's a few cuts in the first half where Eren, Reiner, and Falco just stand around in the basement in complete silence with only the faint sound of music pouring through the window that was just great. I think the soundtrack choices were all fantastic and fitting of the tone, though I guess I sort of understand why some may have wanted something more bombastic over the actual transformation segment. Even then, I think the complete silence leading up to the actual transformation does a good job of keeping the tension there until the very climax, rather than tipping off the viewer that something big is going to happen as soon as the BGM peaks. My first time reading chapter 100, that was the prevailing feeling I was experiencing. Shear confusion over what Eren was about to do. At the very start it seems clear he's about to wreck havoc -- ""Same reason as you"". But as soon as the music changes to that sad soft piano piece, and Eren starts talking about understanding the people beyond the walls, you're suddenly thrown for a loop, questioning if all this was a misdirect, and Eren has really changed so much that he's willing to part ways with war and take a more peaceful route with Reiner. Of course, you're left with this feeling of uncertainty up to the very moment Eren stands up and starts to glow, and that's when I was really blown away (along with everyone in those apartments)

in the manga i felt like things were going at a slower pace and at the same time there was still a LOT of tension in the air, then all of a sudden eren fucking transforms and destroys the stage. the way it was set up in the manga really gave more off a slow ticking time bomb feel which is why erens transformation hits a lot harder for me there

in the anime i didnt get to feel the same 'ticking time bomb' feel. it was there, but it was significantly weaker imo. i think the reason why erens transformation felt less explosive was just because they slowed it down. they made erens initial transformation when he shook reiners hand a slow mo, and then the way the buildings cracked felt slower than i expected. if it was more instantaneous BUT with a little bit more setup beforehand it would have been much more hype

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BioLizard18,"I can't believe anyone out there thought this wouldn't be good. I am glad to have held out hope! This was amazing!  


Main observations:  
God, this episode also reminded me of just how awful Magath was early on in the series.  


The final shot of the navy's destruction from beneath the sea after Zeke bombards them was KILLER. Like, wow, this is what an anime adaptation of a manga is all about - giving new and unique perspectives on the scenes we love.  


Another great adapted scene was Reiner's mid-air transformation. Showing the armored form around him as he falls, and the pose... so damn cool!  


I also like the new visual for ""inside a titan"" a lot. The WIT style wasn't bad but... it always seemed weirdly roomy in there. Mappa's style makes it feel like a really cramped and, for lack of better word, gross space with all the innards and veins all over the screen. I like that a lot!  


CG was noticable during Reiner and Porco's assault on the fort especially, but otherwise was good. Not mind-blowing, but rarely got in the way.  


I actually really love the opening. In my ideal AoT opening it is either ridiculous and epic like Linked Horizon or does WEIRD SHIT and this is definitely a certified WEIRD SHIT opening and I am here for it. I just wish there was a bit more symbolism. This is gonna be sooo controversial though I can tell!  


The ending on the otherhand, we've only seen partially, but we can see Ymir and paths in it so that's enough for me!  


Voice actors were amazing, and the episode looked consistently great too.  


The teaser with Jean at the end was interesting too. I always thought it was implied the Paradis scouts had infiltrated Marley for a while but... to see it actually confirmed was cool!  


Overall, I really enjoyed it! I can't wait for more! The declaration of war is gonna be incredible.",gewembf,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 02:57:37,22,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

All the extra details and anime-only shots blew me away.

That and all the other details, like the other members of the play being clearly defined and having the rumbling intercut with people's reactions.  


I agree that the music for the last scene didn't quite reach the hype that most people (me included) had built up for the scene but... I still liked it!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not complaining about the Declaration of War, I think that was sick. But one take that's always bothered me is the whole ""Youseebiggirl is the WARRIORS' song, so it can't play anywhere else!"" argument. Like, it literally played when Eren activated the coordinate at the climax of Season 2, so how is it the Warriors' song? To be specific, it built up to his punch with Attack on D (which in and of itself has the same melody as Youseebiggirl and Apple Seed) and then it switched to Youseebiggirl before going back to Attack on D as the Scouts ran away, so, like, it's really not the Warriors' song. Plus, the main melody of Attack on D (which, again, is the same as YSBG) has played a few other times throughout the anime as well.

If people are referring to the Vogel im Kafig part being the Warriors' song, then that's just not true either, because it's been played a million times throughout the series. Not to mention that Sawano usually names his tracks quite quirkily to allude to their meanings (Attack on D for Dina, K2 being a Japanese pun for Kenny, the Female Titan theme having the female symbol) so I don't get how ""Youseebiggirl"" could relate to Reiner and Bert at all.

So just, all in all, the whole thing about Youseebiggirl being Reiner and Bert's theme feels more like a romanticization on behalf of the fan base than a deliberate trend that the anime has set up, because it is quite literally *not* their theme. I just take this conflation as more of a testament of how iconic and well-done their reveal in Season 2 was.

And if I have to type Youseebiggirl one more time, I'm going to vomit.

End rant.

Like, after rewatching, I still think the scene is really good and really well done, but it easily could've been a lot better. MAPPA had to have known what caliber of song readers were expecting, so I just, like, *really* wanna sit down with whoever made the decision to use 2Volt and just ask them why.

I'm almost certain that the CG shot of the Attack Titan is the one in which we can see his abs? His model is either impressive or the blending/blur/smoke hides it well (or I'm blind).

The transformation OST was just fine, I'd personally prefer the trailer OST for that but it is what it is. Wouldn't say it was bad. Haven't seen anime onlies complain, I guess they wouldn't since they must not have seen motion mangas/fan animations.

It could have been a grander song, but I was fine with what we got, still had chills throughout and my anime only GF was so impressed she asked to watch it again twice for the first time since RtS.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,"2Volt worked perfectly for the ending, overreacting asses. My absolute only problem with the episode was the lack of emphasis on ""Because I was born into this world."" I always imagined it as a sweeping line, that he lets the audience really savor and take in, making them think about the deep implications of such a simple phrase. Maybe his voice tremors at the end as he says world, because he knows that he is mere moments from his death. Maybe the most important line of the speech apart from the actual declaration.

Instead it felt more like a throwaway line, that you maybe aren't meant to feel the weight of without knowing it's a callback. Eren's reaction was good and let the casual viewer know it wasn't just a throwaway line, but damn I honestly was really disappointed in it. Actually maybe my biggest disappointment with the season so far, assuming the Willy/Magath carriage chat gets put back in. I guess I sort of wish they had focused on Eren's face when Willy mentioned going to war with Paradis, because it's the moment he knew for certain that his future memories were set in stone, and why he and Zeke hadn't yet touched in the first place.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,"Y'all are as pessimistic as always I see. I've genuinely never imagined Youseebiggirl fitting with the tone of 100, the only reason I can even imagine it working is for a parallel with Warrior, which in theory is cool but the moments are very different. The Declaration of War is more akin to Annie's transformation in Stohess than Warrior, since both are situations where the opposing party know exactly what's coming but are helpless to really stop it.

Personally I would've preferred a new OST than 2volt, but after listening to the portion of 2volt they use I can see it working much better than Youseebiggirl. I think a lot of people just have it in their heads that nothing can top youseebiggirl, even though WMID literally already exists. From more rational comments it sounds like the episode was really good, if more of a budget saving one from an animation perspective, but had a few things that definitely were negative.

Basically, what I've been saying from before the first episode. This isn't going to top the manga, and people who thought it could had way too high expectations and had likely not even read the manga from before the timeskip, so they don't even know that WIT's adaptation skipped a lot and even wasn't better from a visual perspective by season 3.",girwp86,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-10 17:38:35,29,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,"Falco having future memories has to be significant right? Assuming the Alliance does win this may mean he inherits the Attack Titan for whatever reason.

But goddamn that was amazing. The pacing and voice acting are really my two big things. For the Marley arc especially I never expected visuals to surpass the manga, and I'm actually liking the CG titans so far because it's not like we see a whole lot of Titans, relatively, from this point on anyway. But God the pacing was so great, and every VA choice is on point. I also appreciate that they didn't change a lot of the sound design just for the sake of change, so little things like Reiner's footsteps or the sound of Titan Transformation are consistent with the previous seasons.

It also makes the last eren scenes less tense, before eren transforms its not entirely certain if he will. Only 2 people know that eren is in that room and he could have maybe made a deal with reiner and somehow gotten away. in the anime he has pushed into a corner, he doesn't know that but we do. This then gives him the choice to transform or die. its combined like a 5 second scene of soldiers getting ready but it changes a lot of the wonder of what eren is about to do.",givh549,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-11 13:40:01,26,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Gabi stole the entire episode. While I'm still indifferent to her in the manga, I could see the anime making me like her more. Didn't expect the Jean (could be Willy?) cameo at the end so it looks like we're getting some anime-original scenes in Marley; can't wait to see what else they have in store.

The OP was.....meh. I see what they were going for with the abstract war motif but I was pretty underwhelmed. ED was pretty good, on the other hand. The focus on Falco & Ymir makes me anxious to see what'll happen in the final chapters.

Upon rewatch, I like the whole declaration scene a lot more now; the first time, it was underwhelming to me. Willy's play was portrayed well & the tension was so thick the entire episode. Really the only issue I have was the tonal dissonance with the OST.

These 2 chapters had 99% dialogue so the still images didn't bother me. They actually fit way more than I expected (saw a rumor that the Warrior trap & Karina/Leonhart would be moved to next episode). 

I'd give this a 8.5/10. People understandably had extremely high expectations given this is easily a top 3 moment in the manga & I can see why they'd be disappointed.",girytr7,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-10 17:56:52,25,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

I defended the shit out of the past 4 episodes. Even the cuts to Reiner's backstory. I understood that MAPPA was allocating their resources and I was very pleased with their choices. 

For this episode, I wasn't really pleased all that much. I thought the animation during Eren and Reiner's talk was too stiff. I thought the music choices weren't that good. I think the leaked ost would've been perfect. Everything just seemed to go by too fast. It didn't have the same impact as the slow buildup of the RB reveal in season 2. I was a manga reader for both of these scenes.

I know how ungrateful people can be given how overworked MAPPA has been with the insane deadline for this anime. I still am enjoying this season overall very much and am excited for these next few episodes. But I did not really like this episode from an artistic perspective. I thought the directing and sound design could've been much better. The stiff animation is something I can definitely overlook given how much of a workload the animators are dealing with. 

If you enjoyed this episode then don't let me or anyone else ruin that for you. This is the peak of Attack on Titan storywise in my opinion. Just don't completely shit on people who don't like it as much as you do.

2 DAYS LATER EDIT ~ After rewatching this episode a few times I absolutely love it lol. Even everything I said I disliked earlier. I loved the musical cues (still would've preferred something a bit more epic at the end). I love the visuals. The animation has grown on me. I feel a little bad now for what I said earlier. It was kind of an immediate reaction after seeing the episode on a shitty NHK stream without subtitles. Although, I still stand by my point about not ragging on people who don't like certain things about this show. It's not a perfect show because there's no such

The trailer OST fits very well to the moment where titan Eren jumps out from the building. It makes the scene very “epic“.

I do also like the silence in the actual episode though. The music stops just after Eren smiles and reaches his hand out to Reiner. If you are an anime-only, it makes you think until the very last moment that maybe, Eren will just make peace with Reiner lol.
The suddenness of what is about to happen gets lost in the “epic“ edit, since you can already hear the music rising.

Not sure if I am a big fan of 2volt in that scene though. It does fit well animation wise, I just think it sounds a little too heroic for what is happening.

1. Why did Marley actually infiltrate Paradis? I know it’s to retrieve the founding titan and to get resources, but the last king announced that they would start the rumbling if Marley infiltrates? I know it was a bluff and that he would accept it if they did, but I thought Marley/the rest of the world didn’t know it was a bluff and they know that the rumbling would destroy the world. I think I’m missing smth there
2. Also, Marley wants to take the founding titan for themselves and use it to strengthen their forces, but how is it possible for them to use it as only a royal Eldian is able to use the founding titan’s power and they don’t have any royals (they don’t know Zeke’s a royal and he’s supposed to die soon around this time)?",gitp0j7,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-11 02:30:20,11,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

I already saw op, ed, and some shots. 

op is definitely not bad, I wouldn't talk shit about it, but I don't have much to say yet, and the song is pretty good although, I'd be happy to get LH.

ed is GREAT. First place with ending one probably, or even dethrones it. I like the parallel between ed6, Falco's ending, and ed1 Mikasa's ending.

I was hyping myself that we're getting a Willy Tybur tease, but it ended up being Jean. For a few minutes I was somewhat disappointed that the tease didn't happen, but tbh getting Jean is also great. 

When people were shit talking about cgi monke i was getting worried, and in fact, From the single image I saw of it until now, it does look weird, but whatever. Hope the climax of the saga will be good.

I also couldn't resist to see ep 2 pv, and I must say, I immediately started laughing because that commander (don't remember his name) looks like a mustache-less Hitler, and someone also pointed it out on Youtube so...

Off topic, I really think that  leakers are unfortunately hinting that the Rumbling will not be adapted as a TV anime.

Anyways, really hyped for the episodes!!


Btw I also think that it's lame that they're marketing season 4 as ""The Final Season"", while we're getting more, movie or not.",gevest9,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 21:48:48,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Unpopular opinion probably, but the Plot Armor Titan looked the worst, and the slowness. Angles were a bit disappointing sometimes, but that's fine I guess.

My friend who read up to the end of Marley saga seemed to be excited during the episode,but had the same criticism as me. He said that the animation as a whole got somewhat worse, and the other one agreed with him. The former still looks forward for chapter 100ish the most, and he still hates Gabi for potatoing Sasha, cause she was probably one of his favourites, and he didn't get the full picture yet.

i think the 2 places it stuggles most at the moment is hair and movement.

the fact that the titans on some frames hop between being animated at 24 frames and 12 is something that can really take you out of the scene, especially so when going from fast movements to calm. reiners roll to avoid the train is a good example of this. flows alright, but the animation is very start/stop as soon as the movement is over.

also hair. I think this is the most jarring thing, and why the beast titan specifically is called out as an issue. the Shaders themselves are good, but the way the hair on the titans moves needs a bit of work, since it can really desync with the motion sometimes.

That said I still loved it and the rest of the episode was absolutely fantastic. One thing I will note though is that Willy and Magath's talk before the event was missing. Not too big of a deal but it also provides some insight on Willy's mindset on the whole issue. Guess it's not really needed anymore and idk where they could fit it in.

When I was watching the episode, I felt a little underwhelmed by Willy’s speech and erens conversation with Reiner because I was so used to the fan made version where there the pacing was a lot slower and there were more breaks between the dialogue.

But when the climax of the episode begun and a lot more started happening, all the CGI was quite jarring to me, especially after 59 episodes of getting used to WIT titan animation.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Otheagony,"And it all comes full circle. The moment when you hear the Colossal Titans theme from the first episode you know what's about to happen, and Reiner's dread at the realisation makes it all the more impactful. Throughout the first half you can sense the buildup, in the music and the different chain of events starting to kick off. The play itself serves as good buildup whilst at the same time giving us the exposition to why the start of the series happened, and now that we know why the first attack on the walls happened all those years ago, we now ask why Eren is about to attack Marely and ho it came to this moment.

Another point I liked is how throughout the episode, Eren just looked dead in the eyes, no emotion, nothing, they were bland and you could barely see his pupil, whereas Reiner, Falco and everyone else on Marely, had eyes so full of life, again drawing parrallels to the first episode. But what makes it even more frightening is that we only see life and emotion in Erens eyes once he talks once more about destroying his enemies. This time, he isn't saying it off to the distance or to himself, he's doing so whilst looking directly into his enemies eyes. He's now reached the moment he always talked about, and he knows it, but somehow we can barely tell what he's feeling, after seeing him get so angry, so emotional about talking about this goal of his back on Paradis, when you see him say it now, so bluntly and without emotion, you know that the Eren we know is gone, all that's left is a machine of pure will and destruction.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fullmetal-ghoul,"Kind of disappointing I can't lie. It was obviously a great episode because the content is just so good and it was a solid adaptation of it but I wish they went above and beyond. It could've easily been one of the best episodes in any anime but I don't think it's on that level because it felt like just another episode adaptation wise, rather than a standout in the way it deserved, like the best HxH or Gintama episodes are for example. 

Main complaint like everyone else is the declaration of war which was a little underwhelming, though that's for sure impacted by the leaked OST. In the manga it's easily the best moment in the series up until that point but I feel like quite a few moments in the anime surpass it. Eren empathising with Reiner didn't really hit as hard as the manga as well but I can't really explain why tbh. I think the contrast between the more personal conversation and Willy's theatrical speech was done better in the manga as well. 

It could just be the fact I'm a bit salty over the series in general right now because of the last few chapters which killed my excitement. It was definitely a good adaptation but I was hoping for more, definitely much preferred the manga",gitb2fy,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-11 00:35:39,15,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

However the rest of the episode felt like a slight downgrade from the manga, like every shot is 90% of the quality of the manga panel. Way too many jarring jumps between scenes, the crowd responded quite weakly to Willy's emotions and he himself didn't deliver enough emotion into the line ""But I don't want to die"".

I also am not a fan that Reiner was mostly a bit more confident in the anime and that they didn't show the people in the building as Eren transformed, killing them. Those were decisions, not lack of effort or skill. But I don't understand these choices.

CG ain’t bad. Cart and Jaws look better with. Beast Titan has its faults and kinda lost its “punch” with the stark and arguably boring visual transition. Armored titan probably looks awkward in like two shots, otherwise spectacular job and decent movement. Sometimes CG can get “too fluid” in contrast to the outlaying 2D so glad I don’t feel that here.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HistoriaTheFirst,"I have posted nothing but dozens of positive comments all day about the episode, including the content and the OP and ED both of which I absolutely adore. 

I think you guys watch a lot more anime than me. The CGI didn’t bother me at all. There were only a few scenes where I could tell it was CGI. I’m truly not seeing how Zeke looks worse than the others and I’m really trying to (but like I said, this sounds like a me problem).  So my following criticisms have nothing to do with the CGI. 

Here is some criticism:

-MAPPA’s eyes aren’t the same as WIT’s. That might sound minor, but WIT brought about so much emotion in characters’ expressions with their eyes and that first scene of Falco waking up showed just how lacking MAPPA is in this department. 

-The color palette was overall dull. It was as if a fade filter had been placed over every single scene and it’s just not as visually appealing 

-I didn’t mind the CGI but the blur was real. There were several times I had to pause and rewind because I thought my connection was bad because my screen seemed blurry all of a sudden, but nope, that was the actual episode 

-The lack of a score in certain scenes really stood out

-I love the OP, don’t get me wrong. The scenes we do have that have actual content are exactly what I wanted for this arc, and those scenes alone were done so well that it made the OP one of my favorites of all time.  Those scenes are perfect. But there were several scenes of just colorful clouds, not even explosions. I hope that they’re going to add to the OP as the season goes, but if they don’t do that, I am really questioning the decision to include several seconds of literal clouds with nothing else in an OP of such a popular series. 

-Adding to that, while the ED is beautiful, it also has scenes of just sparks flying around for several seconds. 

-I watched the live stream this morning and I’ve seen the Hulu official sub as well as clips of the fanmade subs. Gabi’s hair has a distinct purple hue. While that may sound super nitpicky, in a series where characters are made to look realistic, I really must wonder why MAPPA chose to go with such an unnatural hair color for her. It’s definitely not black or dark red; it’s purple. 

Most of my critiques are really minor things because I honestly believe MAPPA did a great job overall. I can’t count how many times I got emotional over this episode today that was based on a chapter I didn’t particularly feel much for in the manga. Good on MAPPA. I look forward to their next episodes.",gex3krg,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 07:25:15,27,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

IMO all it need is just better pacing and spaces between dialogue (especially the transition from Willy's speech to Reiner's breakdown). They could have not added the soldiers searching for eren and let the dialogue flow as it is. Although, I have to agree that manga readers have played this scene differently in their mind, of course there will be disappointment. The flow of the chapter in the manga is soooo perfectly drawn.

The ost will grow on me as I continue to rewatch this, but the edited version with the fan-made ost is the headcanon for me lol. At least Eren's sorrowful and accepting smile is there at the end, that's the key development in this chapter. All in all, great episode.

The focus is mostly on Willy's speech, which draws away from the center of the episode going on between Eren and Reiner. When Willy says ""Eren Yaeger,"" he was supposed to SCREAM IT, or at least make it have some sort of significance in production, instead it got mixed down and filtered to where it lost all intensity. The OST used when Eren transforms is not very fitting in my opinion, I would've liked something more dramatic. Additionally on Eren's transformation, the animation was mostly stills, which was a little disappointing. They decided to add in soldiers storming the basement for some reason, I'm assuming to make the anime-only fans feel like Eren *had* to transform and had no other choice, when it was really his plan all along. This just adds confusion, frankly, because people who haven't read the manga will read Eren's intentions incorrectly. It was a good episode, but it could've been better.

Anyways, I liked episode. The tension buildup was just wonderful, and even I, who knows what will happen, is getting nervous. The OST disappointing people is an odd complaint, but I believe that this quiet background noise of 2volt fits the scene more than YSBG. I was kinda disappointed at first, but the more I rewatch, the better it gets.

Now, time for my personal fangirling about voice actors and actresses essay. Reiner's VA (Yoshimasa Hosoya) captured his emotions well. I could really feel that he was guilty and regretful of his actions to Paradis Island. And Yuki Kaji... He nailed the calm Eren voice very well. It just felt like Eren aggressively guilt tripping Reiner in the basement scene like the manga but more intense. Also Falco's VA was pretty great too.

I also wanna comment on Pieck's scream while falling down the hole. It's really cute lmao. And then Yelena's voice actress was amazing, her voice (probably lowered down to fit Yelena's disguise) was not exactly the one in my head, but it feels great seeing her voice acted.

God tier CG, especially for The Armored and Beast titans, the guns/cannons, Porco and Pieck were also good CG, but nowhere near the others. (Kinda reminded me of JJBA CG tbh)

Nice voice acting 

Overall very fluid animations, obviously going to take some getting used to but it’s certainly for the better

ED and OP sounded great, kinda dissatisfied with the OP visuals though.

Music was really good sounding, though did feel a bit out of place sometimes.

Pretty nice pacing as well.

What was Willy’s point in declaring war if he knew that it would result in an attack on everyone in Liberio? He had no reason to believe anything bad would happen if he just left things to the status quo.

Zeke’s plan (even if it was a lie) was to reclaim the founding Titan to deter the world from attacking Marley. He tells the warriors that the Tyburs will narrate ... something ... so they can do that. What was he even talking about?

I'm really miffed that Willy and Magath's carriage conversation was skipped though. That convo was extremely important in (further) humanising Willy, humanising Magath, and providing a concrete reason for why the brass of the Marlyean military and tons of diplomats were purposely packed together. It would also reveal that Willy knew he would likely die. 

Maybe the next episode will have the carriage convo as the prelude, and with Willy ending the conversation alluding to the fact that he expects to die.

This could just be an anime-only thing that has no bearing on future events, or it could be a real manga spoiler (for currently unknown future manga events) in the anime.

As for the episode itself, it felt... good. It definitely felt like AoT, except a few weird parts (music was uncanny in certain scenes, I'm undecided on the OP and ED). But otherwise, its at the standard we expect from an AoT anime. Well done MAPPA.

Gabi though... man, I actually forgot how manipulative she could be if she's determined. She played on Magath's own hesistation and relutance, netting herself a chance to shine. People with such fierce resolve are always finding new ways to worry you with the lengths they would go to for whatever it is they want... her title of ""female Eren"" is well-deserved.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShingekiNoEren,"I feel like the anime-onlies' reaction to Eren slaughtering civilians at the festival isn't going to be as drastic or controversial as when it happened in the manga.

Remember how that was a super huge and controversial thing between manga readers? One side immediately branded Eren as an evil monster, the other side still believed that what Eren was doing was justified/for the greater good, and some people were pretty much neutral.

I'm a Jaegerist myself and I hope at the end of the manga, Eren wins. But I still remember being a bit shocked when Eren started killing civilians at the festival.

I think this was because of the month-long wait between chapters, which kinda artificially made us think we were more attached to these characters than we should be. It took 10 months from us first being introduced to the Marleyan POV to see Marleyan and other civilians getting slaughtered by Eren. In that time frame, we had a lot of time to make fanart, theories, analyses, re-read the chapters, and just in general sympathize with and appreciate the Marleyan side of things. That's why, when Eren came swinging, it caused such a schism in the fanbase.

But...it's not gonna take 10 months from this episode to reach the Battle of Liberio. A single anime episode almost always condenses multiple manga chapters inside of it. And we're not getting one episode a month, but one a week. It's gonna be a lot shorter of a wait, which gives the anime-onlies less time to become attached to the new characters.

On another note, where do you guys think that this 16-episode season will leave us? I know that they showed Eren and Reiner's final battle in Shiganshina in the trailer, but can they actually get all the way there in 16 episodes?",gexdun0,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 10:09:16,28,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

2Volt feels too triumphant. This is the part of the manga where you're supposed to start seeing that Eren isn't an absolute good, and Reiner and the Warriors aren't an absolute evil. Because Eren has begun doing what the Warriors did, massacring innocent people. I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MPYyqJJHL4) OST would have fit that narrative much better.

What does worry me though is the number of episodes. I read that the Blu-rays of season 4 will be 16 episodes across 2 discs. I think 16 episodes is not nearly enough.

 There are rumors the story will be finished with movies and I'm not a fan of that idea at all. You can't just stitch 5 episodes together and say it's now a movie. It doesn't work that way. Movies have a different structure than tv shows. Manga or comic books like AOT or Walking Dead translate easier into tv series because they follow the same serialized structure. Novels translate easier into movies because they usually follow the same 3 act structure. Obviously they aren't mutually exclusive. You can turn a novel into a series or a manga into a movie. But it's way easier to take serialized manga chapters and turn them into serialized tv episodes (or chapters) than trying to fit them into a 3 act movie. You have to rework it more. 

Maybe they can pull it off but I just don't like the idea of them fucking with the story at the last stretch. But we'll see how it all pans out.",gj103aa,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-12 19:51:07,3,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

This is our first time seeing Eren killing innocents and they use a heroic ost??? We know Eren is conflicted about his actions so the ost doesn't match his feelings and neither the tone. The only way I see it working is if it was put to contrast the horrific things we are seeing but that's kinda weak and I don't think many watchers will get it.

MAPPA didn't mess it all up, but keep in mind that the source material is so good that even fan-made videos also looked great on some level to what a million-dollar animation company can produce can put it in perspective. We are still 11 episodes away from the season and I can bet the budget will only get tighter going forward.

Like, you do realize  Kodansha could've waited for WIT to finish whatever the hell they are working on and then give them AoT, right? They didn't because they wanted to cash out on the high hypes that the manga is finishing regardless if the quality suffers. And I say this as the guy who doesn't mind paying a premium for the Bluray sets, I don't see why I would for this season when the manga art is so superior.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MDuff57,"Pretty gutted that they slow-mo’d, still-framed and CGI’d perhaps the single most important/impactful moment in the manga. The episode was great up until the actual declaration. The final scene (to me) felt like a period at the end of what should have been an exclamatory sentence. In my opinion the music should have been louder, the animation should have been 2D and fluid, they shouldn’t have slow-mo’d the transformation, and they should have showed the actual destruction of the stage instead of concealing it behind smoke. Slow-mo and still-frames just sapped all the energy out of the scene for me.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Capt_Monty,"I just wanna put in perspective the comparison between the bertholdt and reiner reveal and declaration of war, becuz i think one of them elevated the scene in the anime while the other was only an acceptable adaptation.  I’m no mappa hater i love their work on season 4 so far but I feel like there’s a lot they could’ve done to make declaration of war feel like that wow moment. It’s fine as it is, but feels hollow at the same time and I wish they would’ve kept in some details such as the people above eren in the apartment building when he transforms or the punch through the stage.  Those are kinda nitpicks ik but the ost is an issue too that’s been talked abt so much already that I don’t need to say much abt it here, and the attack titan looked a bit whack and fat imo. As far as an adaptation of a big moment goes declaration just feels bare bones. On the other hand, the warriors reveal took a big moment and used a new ost, good pacing, and added bits like the flagpole snapping to make the scene that much more tense.  It took what was great in the manga and made it even better.  I wish mappa could’ve done the same for declaration, but as it is rn it’s not bad, it just could’ve been better. I’m very much looking forward to what mappa does w the next few episodes tho the shots we saw of eren and the warhammer in the preview look great.",gitfyd4,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-11 01:15:34,6,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IcarusIvys,"I am about to type something very long, its more like a vent than **complaint,** I just think it needed to be said.

I, as a manga reader who has loved SnK for the longest time, read the manga and watched the series several times, I think I had set way too high expectations of this scene, than what was projected. I think there could have been some details which could have made the last scene way better than it actually was.   
The episode through the entirety of it until the last scene was 10/10 for me, I loved the use of the good old OST from the previous seasons. I had tried to defend it from all sorts of false criticism (so please don't assume me to be one of those haters who falsely complain), but this time I have some things to say as well.  
I am happy seeing the anime-onlies be happy, but what they have in consideration while watching this episode is the progression of the story line as well execution, but we manga readers already know what is about to happen so we focus more on the execution of the scene.   
Even some of the YT motion mangas had depicted this chapter in a better way (in the OST department especially).  
Here are some of things I personally think could have been done well.  


* For the people who are saying that YSBG wouldn't be a good match for this scene, yes I do agree with the fact that the symbolism of YSBG is a bit different from what was trying to be symbolized in this scene but you can't possibly tell me that 2VOLT, an OST which literally generates vibes of heroism is more suitable than YSBG? I just feel like we got played because of how we got hinted YSBG towards the end of ep4, but we got this. Yes I am aware of the fact that we can still get a redone scene from the recap of this episode in the next episode, with a better OST, **but the impact can never be the same as how it could have been in this scene.** I'd have rather wanted the leaked OST which actually fit really well with this scene, or just anything new if YSBG didn't ""fit well"". I am saying this after watching lots of edits with different OSTs playing, and they do sound and fit in better. Yeah i understand the fact that the playing of YSBG or any other hype OST would giveaway what was about to happen, but I don't agree with that, if adjusted well, it could have still fit in with the surprise element punching in.  

* I really wish Willy's voice was more echoed and loud in the climax of the episode, to build the intensity and commotion. I wanted him to scream, with fear in his eyes. I did love the fact that his nervousness was reflecting in his voice, I just think it could have been louder, echoed and more focused.   

* We could have had details like, the Marleyan soldiers rushing down to the basement, I wish they were banging the door, during the climax of the scene before Eren transformed and they were storming in, it would be amazing to make it more intense.  

* I wanted Eren's titan to have more sharp features, the face looks really good, it looks more terrifying compared to that of WIT's design but I really wanted his eyes to look at Willy's, smashing his hands down the stage, and then lifting him up in the air. In this episode it looked really simple, it looked as though he just grabbed him and lifted him in the air, and the CG made Eren's titan at 21:57 look like a fat Roblox character, and I'm generally not even picky with animation.   

* I also wanted those manga textures that Reiner and Bertholdt had in their reveal, I wanted Eren to have it as well (would look sick and I know for a fact that MAPPA would have no problem doing it.)  

* In a nutshell, i just wanted more focus in the last part of the episode, in both animation and music department, slight elongation of it as well but i guess we didn't have time did we?  
Well it could still be adjusted by cutting some scenes and adding them later but oh well.

The animation was a 10, the voice acting and the pacing were a 10. The OST was a bit lacking in the end and i dont understand why they didn't choose a better track but it really didnt take anything away from Eren's transformation for me. Animation wise it was executed perfectly. I was holding my breath until the very last moment.

The moment reiner turns to falco with glowing Eren was perfect. They chose silence for the ""i keep moving forward until my enemies are destroyed"" which is fine but they could have used the chorus from a more iconic song or even the unreleased track we heard. 

Either way i suspect they did this to cater to the anime onlies which was bound to happen.

This episode was very good in regards of story progression. There was very good scene here and there but for some reason I am disappointed with art and animation (although I am not going to complain that much since they didn't have time to began with). VA are so incredible, they bought the life to the story. 

The biggest disappointed with me was tension. This episode was for tension but I barely feel it. The ost choice was worst. This season ost are not good in most part but now the most important episode had weak ost made it like joke. The art and animation quality are not good compared to previous episodes. It seems like from now on we will going to get less quality episode. 

There was some scenes which was cut from manga in previous episodes makes Annie , Reiner and bert conversation pointless or not meaningful to me. If I was anime only then I might have not understood it. That scene was so much important for character development ( to understand character).  And there was few scenes which was cut but not that important was discussion between Willy and Theo.

The best part of this episode was eren development. He acted only after declaration of war. He even was clam as fuck compared to previous seasons where he was so impulsive. The titan design was af🔥. Looking forward for war hammer titan. If next episode was done right, it might go down as best episode till now.

OP is ok-ish. It gets better once the explosions stop, peaks at the last 15 seconds, when they build up to showing the Attack Titan.

Gabi and Falco's VA were great. VA's for pretty much everyone did a very good job. Gabi's laugh after derailing the armored train made me squeal in delight, no joke, and I'm a guy so that's rare for me.

Jaw Titan looked great, Cart and pure titans were passable, the bigger titans were lackluster. Unfortunately, it will probably be the same for the Warhammer, Attack Titan etc. I didn't even notice Jaws was CGI at first. But Beast and Armored are an eye sore any time they move.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrDollSteak,"I'll be honest, I might have like terrible eyes or something, but I straight up didn't even notice it was CGI until like one or two frames with the Beast Titan. The animation was absolutely incredible! The battle was excellent, with all of the titans managing to feel threatening and powerful even when going up against soldiers and armoured trains. Can MAPPA please go back and fix up the Colossal Titan from Season 2 and 3 for like a complete season blu-ray boxset or something now that they're on the production committee?

In all seriousness, I thought it was a great episode. I have full confidence in MAPPA going forward. It condensed the two chapters really well, and managed to fix all of the few issues that I had with the chapters in the manga itself, in terms of the tone and dialogue. I think that rather than feeling like an exposition dump this episode actually felt like a logical sequence in the progression of the overall story. The explanations about why the war was happening, why they were there, and who all the characters were, felt far more natural, and as a result my interest and engagement with the battle itself was much higher.

Controversially, I also think the nods to later chapters, Falco's vision, and Jean buying the newspaper were excellent touches, that also helped to sell why these sequences are important in the overall context of the narrative, and made Falco's introduction in particular, feel a lot more like a main characters by having some clear parallels to Eren's dream with Mikasa.

I really don't understand the criticisms about the OP or the other music throughout the episode, I felt like everything slapped. In all honesty, this OP is easily in my top 3 of what we've seen so far. It captured the more technological feel of this arc as well as the existential dread that defines it, in comparison to the upbeat medieval ones of previous seasons, and the explosions of colour on otherwise statue-like graphics was a fantastic contrast in my opinion. I also imagine some of these explosions will be toned back in later episodes as more information and battles are had, not that in my mind this really needs to happen as I think its fine regardless. It feels like its for a completely different anime granted, but I don't consider that a negative at all, because that's exactly how I felt about the overall story after reading chapters 90 and onwards. Everything that came before now feels more like the prequel to the ACTUAL action, and I think this mature and gritty direction is far superior.

Overall, I'm just so excited that this is actually happening. It's surreal that as the manga is ending we have the final season coming out, and it is so far, absolutely incredible as an adaptation, and as Isayama says the 'final' version of the story. Full disclosure, I felt the same way about Season 3, and thought that it was overall much better than the equivalent manga chapters throughout apart from the occasional 'Ereh' criticisms about Mikasa's characterisation. Nevertheless, I am fully expecting that Season 4 will be the perfect end to this story!",gew2ur2,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 01:09:19,46,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisuthepretty,"This episode accurately showcases the world's hatred for Eldians. The Eldians were used as suicide bombers, suicide titans, etc. without second thoughts for their lives. It was really sad to witness them die as tools. 

The scene of the Eldian man kissing the photo locket around his neck, which most likely held a photo of his wife or family members, before charging out to die was really heart breaking. He knows he will die as a tool and he will never see his family again. Also he most likely knew his death wouldn't amount to much or change how the world views Eldians but he gladly did it anyways for his family to have a better life than before. That's probably another reason why he kissed his necklace. He was doing it for them.

The Eldians were told their deaths would be meaningful but that isn't the case at all. Marley (and the world) will still see them as Eldian devils even though they are helping their oppressors to win a war. Even though Marleyans need them to survive, they treat them like crap. It's really sad.

I think the  Beast Titan is really my only complaint about the CG, but I'm alright if they just polish it up later on and move forward.

Magath's voice actor is a great one too! He portrayed the actual voice my mind would give whenever he says something in the manga.

Have to get used with the CGI animation for the Titans, but their usage is still beautiful in my eyes.

Also, they managed to give hype to both anime-onlys and manga readers. The dialogue on Falco saying he flies with swords can be both forshadowing for the future chapters/episodes or just a fourth wall break for the animal onlys because of the change of perspective.

The opening gives a war-like tone, like it tells the story is not about eliminating Titans anymore, but in a much wider perspective of war between two sides. And the ending song just gives the usual Attack on Titan vibes: suffering and depression.

With a steady pace of 2 chapters per episode, the part could end with chapter 122 and neatly set up the rumbling arc. This is super fast but there are a lot of action scenes and they might cut/compress some parts of the Marley arc.

It might also end with chapter 113/114 with Erens escape/Pieck/spinal fluid wine as a cliffhanger and the Zeke/Levi forest confrontation as an action-heavy mid-season finale.

I would even say that if it were mappa that started AoT from season 1 instead of wit I would be satisfied (Not trying to debunk wit they did an amazing job as well).

I love the additional scenes they added as well with soldiers being gunned down and blown up to the extended battle of the armoured titan.

The opening again it's not wit but I do like it in its own way but it is very different but still good, also the end of the opening has erens attack titan on top of a bunch of other unique looking titans is that foreshading the current events of the manga I wonder?

The biggest thing for this episode and most likely the rest if the season is again yes it's very different compared to wit and the previous 3 seasons but and I big BUT it's completely ok being different because in its own way it's still fucking amazing.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,reicha7,"I thought it was really good. Took some getting used to the art style but the shifter titans look absolutely spectacular!

Really liked how they extended the fight with Reiner getting his ass handed to him (even if adding a second armoured train was a bit weird considering how important the first one was) but still proving how strong Titans were.

Liked the extra focus on the Eldian soldiers as they were being briefed for the suicide charge. The sheer horror on display and the nightmarish suicide vests (which is such a Marley thing to do) was a great flourish.

Gabi and Magath's VAs were absolutely phenomenal and really helped bring the chars to life.

Some of the really wide shots looked a bit janky at times. An example is when the titans are smashing into the ground and then just vanishing in a puff of smoke basically. 

I also always pictured Zeke's scream being a much more terrifying sound but maybe he'll do a better one in beast form.

I think in terms of pacing it was good to get both those chapters out the way in episode 1. I know people are concerned at a 2 per-episode pace but here it made sense as it was largely action and they still had to pad it out with extra shots to hit the runtime anyway. I imagine it will slow down again until episode 4 or so so we can get all the awesome world building and character interactions that made the Marley arc so great",gevlxsn,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 22:44:49,7,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,salmancharms,"The highlights of the episode:
-The OP with its unsettling nature; It was already expected it to be creepy from the same band who made the S2 ed. 

-The focus on deaths, dead bodies and atrocities of war; It really enhanced the theme of the Arc, like the soldiers watching from the heap of dead bodies, situation in trenches.

-The mindless Titans drop. That was just amazing! 

-The framrate and good CG; The fluidity of action scenes was amazing. The aerial shots, The armored train, Jaw Titan's scenes, Majority of Reiner's scenes were really good.

-Realistic colours and art; The detailing was really good. The scenes of Gabi destroying the train was too good. Although I liked the slightly saturated colours of WIT, I love the realistic colours too.

-The still scenes of bodies flying!

-The Eyes! Everyone was afraid of eyes not being to the level of WIT but MAPPA's eyes are amazing too.

-OUR BOI >!JEAN!<

-The soundtrack. It was good and immersive, especially after the mindless titan drop.

Minor things which I didn't like:
-The Jaw titans face; I loved how they animated him in the PV but downgraded him a little bit like the teeth, amount of hair,etc.

-Increased amount of CG on Reiner and Zeke; Reiner's CG while destroying the Fort looked really good but they should have kept it 2D in still scenes which made the CG prominent like Reiner signalling Zeke, Zeke destroying the ships. The shift from smooth action scenes to the jarring 12 fps hurt me.

-The ""Isn't war a terrible thing scene"". I had so much expectations for the scene from the small clip in PV, but they ruined it with CG Zeke. 

In my opinion, MAPPA is more or less saving it's budget for the *spoiler* >!The declaration of war and Liberio raid!< Which are much action packed and integral to the story.
Both the studios, WIT and MAPPA are amazing! As we have seen the news about the Production team's forceful calendar to release the season in less amount of time. So, we need to give MAPPA the benifit of the doubt!
Overall, I loved the episode! I liked the OP, which sets the mood for the arc. I'm excited for the future episodes! Let's see what's more to come.

P.S. I got to know from the comments that CGI wasn't done by MAPPA themselves, but was outsourced to another studio. I really hope the jarring CGI isn't repeated again!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAteTheCheezyNacho," My thoughts:

The OP:

Its  visually quite good but its a bit repetitive and lacks variety. I love  the smoke effects and the explosions look gorgeous. The rainbow colours  picked sort of remind me of the rainbows in OP 5 and I adore the airship  and the soldiers marching, they really fit the Marley aesthetic.  This  all comes together to make an idea of war being romanticised by Marley  but the reality is different as then comes the images of the Marley  soldiers, Survey Corp scouts and the airship being smashed to pieces  showing how war is horrible and affects all.

Then  we get a liquid falling into a puddle and someone holding out their  hand in the rain, this I believe could be the blood rain we've seen  before in the last episode of season 3.

Next,  we get the shot of the painting style landscape full of bodies and  above them all stands the Attack Titan (probably Eren) reaching out with  an Armoured Titan (probably Reiner) visible behind him possibly showing  the battle in chapter 119. The Attack titan looks really demonic in  this and the imagery of it being at the top is really fitting given that  Eren has the Founding titan.

Overall,  this OP is hard to compare to the previous ones because of how  different it is. Its very aesthetically distinct and aims for different  things. Whereas previous OP's focussed more on characters and story with  Epic undertones this one seems to focus more on the horrors of war  while blending it in with propaganda that was so prevalent during this  time in our world. In terms of the song it really fits the visuals and  the theme they are going for. It seems slightly unnerving and creepy  whilst retaining a bit of the hype that characterised the previous OP's.

The Episode:

The episode was inconsistent in quality but in general very good. This section is a bit nitpicky:

The  first thing that was immediately obvious to me was Colt's ridiculous  running in the beginning, whilst not terrible in animation it just  looked a bit absurd and took me out of the episode. The new music  sounded familiar compared to earlier songs and in general fitted in very  well personally in the first section.

The  additions to the episode were I also love the added shots of the  trenches and showing how terrifying it is for the people there and how  exhausted they are. Later on in the episode I also liked the addition of  suicide bombers to hammer home how brutally Marley treats Eldians. The  scene with the soldier climbing over corpses also really helps to  establish the mood of the season.

One  thing that stuck out to me in a good way was surprisingly the animation  on Gabi's foot when she is unattaching the grenade, everything flowed  so well and it looked really natural. I appreciate that MAPPA also kept  the midroll information sheets  as well as the episode number cards and  to be continued card.

Occasionally  it was obvious that they were obscuring peoples mouths to cut down on  the ammount of time they were needing to animate but overall the still  frames were good. Upon watching it again the CGI used for certain things  has grown on me especially with the armoured train and the arial shot  of the Fort. The CGI with Cart and Jaws was surprisingly good although  not as amazing as they were in the trailer. The both of them themselves  were hard to tell apart from their hand drawn counterparts and the only  thing that caught me onto realising they were CG was their movement.  MAPPA really did the titan bombardment scene justice, also the lack of  censorship was interesting given that it is airing on the same network  as last season.

Probably my  biggest problem with the episode was Armoured and Beast titans CGI, in  itself the CGI was actually passable but transitioning between shots was  terrible. The speed at which the action happens makes it hard to tell  what is happening sometimes so it doesn't help that both the beast and  armoured land, and then are presented in massively different ways. For  example, the beast comes down from the sky in a t-pose style before  transitioning in the very next frame to having his manga pose of hand  reached out to the ground with another behind pointed to the sky. Also  the beast's face looks really uncanny valley even compared to his style  in WIT.

Finally, the blend between  the beast throwing the shells to the naration to the scene with Jean  was so smooth and well executed. The last scene especially was really  well done and gives me a lot of hope for the festival scenes, it looked  exactly how I would have expected a good WIT adaptation to look but with  a depth of field blur added. I understand why some people might be  against Jean's appearance but for the casual viewer if they are able to  surmise his identity it will give them some hope of returning to their  main cast and to the ones that don't guess who he is it adds in that  mystery that drove seasons 1 through 3.

Overall,  the episode was a 9/10 which is better than I expected although it  leaves a bit of room to be desired. The backgrounds and character  designs were consistent, well presented and detailed which I loved. The  additions give me hope for a more fleshed out world and the pacing was  perfect. Whilst the worst thing was obviously the CGI, I believe that as  long as the quality remains consistent they will grow on me and get  better.

The ED:

Obviously  we have only seen the last part of the ED so it is possible that there  are things in the first part that indicate different things.

The  ED it starts with falco standing infront of a wall (possibly one on  Paradis) with birds flying in the background, these are probably just  part of the general bird symbolism in the series.

Then  images appear behind him showing general images of the battle and we  get a closeup of his face probably to show how the fighting impacted  him. The title of the ed ""shock"" probably relates into this as Falco to  some extent is suffering shell shock or something similar, a relatively  common thing in WW1 for soldiers to get.

It  goes on to show Falco closing his eyes and thinking of a phoenix flying  obviously in reference to his dream before it explodes into a ball of  light. out of which many string like effects appear. I believe these to  be a representation of paths, they make up the body of the phoenix after  all. We then see Ymir with the paths tree behind her and you can see  the paths coming off it, I love the pan up here and the slow growing of  the tree.

We then see the screen  fill with the paths and then they are condensed down into a sphere that  Falco grabs, in reference to him gaining the power of the titans, before  finally the scene where Falco reaches out to a bird.

Overall  the ED is great, breathtaking song and stunning visuals although it,  like the OP, is very distinct from the other ED's it probably overall my  2nd favorite ED behind Season 2's.",gev22nh,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 20:22:52,9,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Daddy-Dalton,"I think the most disappointing part of the episode was just how much cgi was used, it was used for all the shifters, machine guns, ships, etc

The guns and ships are understandable but it was kinda a letdown to see that all the shifters are cgi, especially since they were 2d in all previous seasons and 2d in the trailer Mappa put out back in May

Don't get me wrong, I think the CGI animation looked incredible (with the exception of the beast titan and some shots of the Jaws, which hopefully will get better as the episodes come out) but I'm sure if we all had the option, we'd all want them to be 2D

I'm just curious on why they made the change, why they showed one thing in the trailer and then did the complete opposite for the actual show

It makes me a bit worried about some of the upcoming anticipated fights like Eren v War Hammer or the Attack on Paridis, fights which I feel like won't be as impactful if they have clunky CGI, even if just a bit",gewe6au,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 02:53:27,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,e_m_a_n_r_e_s_u_,"Overall 7-8/10.

Plot: It's Attack on Titan... Of course it's a 10/10! Seriously though, for an introductory episode, it began the season with hype. (Since it's in the manga, I will leave it at that.)

Art/Animation: I really do not like CGI, but S4E01 did CGI much better than I expected. Still, the CGI feels unnatural, especially in an anime like AoT. I really hope they animate Eren vs WHT well, preferably without CGI. I was expecting something closer to the trailer (where I didn't notice any CGI, or at least I don't remember any). I'm not for or against Mappa's art style. Art/Animation: 7/10.

Music: I noticed they reused some of the music from the trailer. This is not a complaint though. That was some dope music. 8/10, no complaints.

The opening was beautiful and perfectly captures the dark and somewhat mysterious vibe of the Marley and Rumbling arcs. I cannot wait to see EREH!!!!

Edit: I also love that in the end of the opening, they clearly show Eren's Attack Titan, being followed by some titans. I wonder what that symbolizes ;)",gew9zt9,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 02:14:22,13,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wrathandweeping,"Things I liked:

- 2D animation : some sequences, like the bird flying to the port while Gabi gave her recap, or Reiners transformation, were amazing — detailed, immersive, fluid, gorgeous 
- 3D animation: honestly, most of it. Very fluid and well blended 
- added scenes / changes: I didn’t love the 1:1 panel adaptation from Wit. Respectful but can be boring as a manga reader. Cool they changed/added some things while honoring the source material 
- hearing some old AOT music 
- the washed out color palette. Hated it in the PV, but grew on me here once I accepted no longer seeing WIT’s striking, vibrant colors 
- opening and ending. I love abstract art, and I love weird typography. Cool how the text appears and disappears asymmetrically throughout, and always respect trying something different 

Things I disliked:
- the blur. Was hoping that was a trailer only thing. Just rewatched hoping I was mistaken, but damn. It flattens everything — even when the shading and motion is dynamic and conveys depth. At the very least the filter setting is too high and constant. As a digital artist I lean on blur to soften my mistakes sometimes... but seems like it’s always on. Honestly gives me a headache 
- Direction. Everything is fluid and realistic, which is cool, but — too much so. MAPPA doesn’t let the frames pause and breathe to give dramatic weight or let us appreciate designs, entrances, twists, etc. Blink and you miss it; gone is that anime stylization that really slows down the action to emphasize specific moments and make them “epic”
- new OST. Im sorry but I hate it. Generic strings brass instruments etc. Old OST blended those components with crazy electronic stuff and Gregorian chants and all other kinds of weirdness and catchy melodies... this is much more lazy and cliche. 
- too much CGI. MAPPA’s CGI is dope, and blows WIT’s out of the water. But WIT only used theirs sparingly: colossal, horses, roof tiles, etc. Seems like it’s used with every shifter, even during still frames / close ups, although these don’t quite happen anymore due to the direction issue noted above. 

Overall: pumped. Even tho the audiovisual aesthetic of S1-3 was probably my favorite aspect of the show, and I do consider this inferior with respect to my personal tastes... I really do appreciate MAPPA stepping up and giving it their all, and I did enjoy this. Despite my criticisms, all my love to MAPPA for this adaptation and I’m excited to see their take on the rest of the story",gewve4i,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 05:42:12,9,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TrojanXP96,"Man, they teased us so bad with that epic Jaw and Cart scenes in the trailer and I know my expectations were too high, before watching the episode I even read that titans were CGI, but even then I'm left with blue balls here.

My guess is they decided to use CGI on titans considering the amount of titan scenes they'll have to do in the future and they didn't want to switch from hand-drawn to CGI all of a sudden in the middle of the season, I'm ok with that.

Then there's this issue of CGI not blending with the background, the titan fps being choppy in some shots etc. I'm sure at least some would agree it was very weird. I haven't watched other shows from MAPPA but I guess I can attribute this to studio's characteristic style, so this is also ok.

There's the part in the trailer where Galliard jumped on soldiers after bending the rail with his Jaw, they removed the pouncing part for some reason, though I'm glad he was masterfully represented as this fast feral frontliner.

Also there's Cart's first scene, they changed that shot a bit and it's generally fine but the angle is so weird for some reason. The trailer angle was definitely better imo.

Reiner with his gunnars looked badass.

Idk wtf that op was (maybe they'll add to it later?) but the ending was pretty good. I wonder if every episode will end blended with the music.

It is fine, it's not bad CG, it's just way too fluid, contrary to everything else. Also, the music went on for like.. too long? Like, half the episode had this epic combat music, which kind of lost its effect by the end. Keep in mind though that I am being very nitpicky here.

Opening was very unorthodox, but I kinda like it. The ending on the other hand was fucking fantastic. Like, holy hell, that shit bangs. 

The average WIT episode was like an 8.5-9.0 / 10.

This episode was a strong 7 / 10.

So not bad by any margin, just, the quality drop was a bit too noticable.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaulVader2,"That was... a wild ride.

First, let's get the minor complaint out of the way, obviously, the CGI Titans. Now, I didn't dislike them, the models are very high quality and I can only imagine how it looks in HD, but it'll take some time to get used to. I just hope that some key scenes like Eren's transformation during the Declaration of War are hand-drawn, since there's not much movement from his titan (the battle with the WH will obviously be CG, that I don't mind).

Besides that, I think the episode looks great. The pacing is perfect, I don't think they cut any lines from the manga, the movement is fluid, the character designs are extremely detailed and the VA's all did an amazing job! Unlike some, I quite liked the opening, it was a risk doing an op without any characters, but I think it payed off, it really sits well with the theme of the Marley Arc. The ending is great as well and I think that Falco is gonna have a far more important role in the resolution of the story then we may think.

Overall, fucking great episode, props to Mappa for putting this much effort into it.",geubpqt,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 16:56:31,4,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,InjusII,"I don't want to be a downer, I had such high hopes for this and even though I absolutely hate CGI, I was still trying to convince myself it will look good and I won't notice it, just like I didn't really mind Wit's colossal titan. 

But damn, I don't know the difference between good or bad CGI, is it blended well enough in the background or not, I am no professional but I can only tell that CGI is not something I like in general, and it looks incredibly stiff for me. 

And i'm just so disappointed seing how bad my boys Reiner and Zook look. Especially since all of their scenes in titan form are CGI. 

I mean when there is a lot of movement, the CGI isn't that bad and can be well integrated. But every fucking frame. There were so many still images that could have been 2D.

 And yes this is definetely a downgrade from WIT. Only the colossal and Rod were CGI, and tbh it wasn't too much of a bother since when there were 2D characters involved in the scene, the colossal was also drawn in 2D (like the scene Bertholdt kindapps Eren, the image where we see his hand holding eren, it is a 2D titan hand) while in this episode, even Monke's hand, zoomed in, when he grabs the missiles, is 3D. 

They could have at least tried to blend 2D animation within the 3D ones, especially for the still frames. 
Especially for the main  titan characters. I mean, the bombarding of titans from the plane had plenty of 2D titans, while our most important titan shifters looked like they came from a (bad) video game cutscene. 

I guess this was a way for us to get used to the CGI in order to prepare us for the rumbling, but i wouldn't have cared less if only the colossals in the rumbling looked CG while all the other episodes and other titans were 2D. I can't imagine Eren or Warhammer titan looking 3D. Or Grisha's titan in the flashbacks, or even Ymir's titan. All these important and amazing scenes will lack life and loose all impact on the watcher (or at least for me) if they are CG. 

That's just my opinion , I know you're all trying to stay positive and see the good in this new season, I was having hope too and trusted that SNK will be in good hands with MAPPA. I really tried, but I've lost all hype. 

I think everything looked good, the seiyuus were incredible as usual, the ost were perfect, the op and ed were good, but the fights, wich are so important in this season, looked so dull and childish for me. I felt no impact when stuff was thrown at titans, no feeling of everything being so small and vulnerable near the giant and creepy titans who fight in a war. I felt so many more emotions while reading the manga, and I feel like these CGI titans don't pay a nice tribute to Isayama's godly titan drawings. 
Especially since the animated version of a manga is supposed to give it life, these fights seemed dead to me, and i felt more life reading the scans compared to this. 

I am not trying to shit on MAPPA or anything, I believe they are giving it their best, and are taking it very seriously, it just isn't working for me. 

I'll miss the times everything was 2D, even the new Ghibli movie is a 3D one, I am at a loss of words. For me, animation looks most beautiful, fluid and natural when 2D. I know it's harder and takes a lot more time, but it's definetely worth it.
I wouldn't have mind if I had to wait a couple more years to watch SNK entirely animated by hand.",gewxe0b,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 06:05:15,18,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wail-D,"Anyone else kind of disappointed about the first episode? Most of my anime only friends I watched it with enjoyed it (though they did have a few critiques). I personally felt like I hyped myself a bit too much. Like when the titans were parachuted down I was anticipating some epic sakuga but was thoroughly disappointed afterwards. When Gabi fell and did her throwing thing I expected the camera to follow the grenades and zoom out as the explosion happened (not saying I didn't like the anime version of that scene though)  


And at first, the slight usage of CGI was fine, I think the first 5 times they used CGI it actually looked good but then during the fighting it just felt off and not as impactful. Mainly because the music was also just... not hitting those key moments, the music was more so for a ""holy shit everything is happening at once"" moment but there wasn't all that much happening.  


To give the anime credit: I really liked Gabi's voice actress, so I'm really hyped to see her continuing and I'm honestly still hopeful they'll do the Marley invasion justice. But we can only hope...",gevnnv9,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 22:59:06,7,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Lisbethman,"I kinda feel like the anime could be a different time loop than the Manga. Falco did not have the flashback in the Manga. Some people said that isayama might have forgotten to add it then, but that seems a bit odd to me. Also the split at chapter 122 would be perfect to make the part after that different... In the Manga, during the rumbling Connie said something like ""how could we get to this end?"" so that kinda implicated an alternate ending to me.. I don't know, I don't have real proof. But everything about eren would fit into that idea. I think the Manga happens first, and the anime is after that. It seems as if eren tried different things to solve the Paradis problem, but nothing worked, so when he can, he goes with the rumbling (he said something like ""because you're here, I now have this path"" to zeke). Maybe the anime is a loop even after that, with another additional happening, giving him another path? The ending was so focused on Falco and I don't see any reason for that when looking at the Manga. So, theory: Falco will eat eren for some reason in the anime (eren probably will know about how useful it would be to get eaten by Falco), and that's why Falco has the flashback to survey corps. He didn't have that in the Manga so at the end of the Manga, he will not eat eren. That would be a time-line where Falco does not gain the ability to see through time and manipulate it. So eren will learn something during Manga timeline that makes him believe getting eaten by Falco might solve something, so in the next loop, the anime, he tries that. Isayama said the anime is the ultimate version of the story...maybe because we've been looking at two different timelines all this time?",gf9kyrr,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-10 11:38:07,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NephilimAura,"Overall, I feel this episode was an above-average re-introduction into the SnK series but overall underwhelming. I have high hopes that episodes to follow will only get better.  
  
I don't like the art style a lot. It's good but I think it's a bit contrasting to how the earlier SnK seasons were drawn. The dirt and ground, the character portraits, and the CGI all are things that stood out to me as things that I don't like a lot and things that I find are a break from the previous art style.  
  
Regarding the CGI: It's average. I wouldn't give it above average or below average. It's stiff and the shadowing isn't perfect but it still fits into the show neatly, to the point where most viewers I'm sure don't look at it as something that stands out from the episode.   
  
That said, I am disappointed that CGI was used, especially when we were handed a trailer that didn't use CGI. Why set up false expectations and lie to the viewers? We all love SnK here and the first episode is going to come out, regardless of what trailer was released. Maybe they ran into some budgeting or other challenges but regardless - I'm one of those ""don't like CGI"" folks.  
  
The CGI looked stiff at times and although it was a step up from the Colossal Titan CGI, it's still not an approach many of us enjoy. I don't like CGI and feel confident that, if the artists took drew things by hand, they would have been able to accomplish good art too. We had an epic Eren-Reiner fights, Eren-Annie fights, and Levi-Zeke fights - mostly drawn by hand, so I don't buy the excuse that ""they wouldn't have been able to pull it off in Marley."" The SnK directors have shown that they are more than capable of pulling of epic fights with hand-drawn illustrations.
  
Moving on:  
  
* Falco dreaming about a bird, waving a sword around is cool but I think unnecessary. It seems like that foreshadowing was just shoved in. There's enough foreshadowing to go around as is, and I hope the direction isn't to shove more foreshadowing like that into character lines because they don't feel there's enough already.  
  
* Gabi blowing up the train was lame. Honestly, are you going to tell me, from an enemy army point-of-view, you're just going to watch an enemy girl crawl up a mountain, without investigating, firing back, or doing anything else aside from gossiping to one another? Especially in war, when people don't exactly act rationally? Sure, I get it - they retaliated with gunfire, but the whole ""let's watch this unknown girl who has something strapped to her leg walk up to a key point of our base, and not do anything"" doesn't seem realistic at all.  
  
* Zeke's intoxicated Titan-bombs(the people in the plane) really didn't feel as big in the Anime than it did in the Manga. They didn't even really looked intoxicated; they looked paralyzed and scared. It felt like, because they were dropped off the plane so quickly, it didn't send a message about war or using civilians as warfare - which I felt was more powerful in the Manga. Even in the trailer, it seemed that scene was going to be given more weight, but it didn't really have it.  
  
Overall, I'm glad SnK is back, but I have high expectations for this season, and higher expectations for future episodes. Many of us were already saying that the new SnK season is going to beat out the other anime for the top spot of highest ratings. I'm still in high hopes for that, but the first episode has dramatically lowered these hopes... especially since the first ep is often supposed to be the one that catches attention.

Part 2 production started in October 2020 . So that makes 1.4 years ( or more ) of production for Part 2 compared to 8 months of part 1 with 16 episodes . If part 2 has 9-10 episodes then this is the best production schedule AoT has ever got .

Falco is doing everything for her and she's constantly an asshole to him.Even with Falco explaining to her why everything happened in Liberio she refuses to acknowledge it.  On top of that she has now killed Sasha which the manga readers knew she was going to do, and who knows what else she does next.

&#x200B;

Then why did he go out of his way to say he wouldnt stop moving forward no matter what ,even if the alliance tried to stop him? Why did he say in chapter 123 that he would flatten the entire world, and kill everyone outside of paradis? He was very specific about everything he said and wanted.

The only explanation to fit in your theory...was that eren didnt mean any of that and was manipulating people to hate him, so he could be stopped midway through the rumbling, which imo is character assassination for Eren. 

Even now, in chapter 137, if Eren was given the chance, i'm pretty sure he would restart the rumbling all over again.

&#x200B;

'' What I will say, though, again, is that it might be that Eren saw it happen in future memories. Reiner's involvement, see you later, you get the gist of it. ''

He did say they were still free, so even though they’re using it’s powers, ymir / eren could be holding it back from stopping the shifters, since they have their own will that she / eren are protecting.

1st being Reiner not understanding Eren in terms of ""We are the same"". In war of paradis he assumed that Eren just want to die but then the looks he gives in his Titan gvies me vibe this is totally opposite. He wants to make throught it cuz off...

2nd being words of song ""Zero Eclipse"". The 1st part of the song is definitely about 104th Ymir and Historia but the 2nd part is about Eren and Historia.

In this part Historia is asking Eren that everything he has done till this points has any meaning  if he has no desire to comeback. That's why she is asking retorically if being paying for all youve done just by dying is being a Hero? the answer is...

In her eyes if he doesn't come back from it alive he is zero. What's the point of doing all of it if you won't come back alive? (It would be just another Lelouch and I think it destory purpose of two lines -  ""I just keep moving forward"" ""cuz he was born into this world""). Also the hide line pretty much is perfect for what is happening right now. Literally Eren who do you hide?

>Make a promise that I cannot regret  
>  
>As long as I can see you but in secret

This is the part about their meetings in Paradis that nobody knew about. They made a promise to each other that they both won't regret. There is so much other paralels but here are already so much other posts desrcibing it so there is no reason to call it here now.

To sum it up Jean calling Eren suicidal bastard is in my opinion perfect here cuz it was like that for entire series up until chapter 90. Since then it is a total opposite. This guy will just keep moving forward and come back alive to hold his child in final panel.

The narrative point of Zeke and Eren’s convo about Mikasa is to discuss the romantic feelings she harbours for Eren, not the ackerbond, which as we know isn’t even real.

The baby wasn’t needed for any kind of plan. Historia simply wanted to have a child (you know, like women do it irl?).

Paths is like a purgatory that she and the other shifters have been trapped in for eons.,gmwmzaa,lgitvd,titanfolk,2021-02-11 06:02:56,2,1,,Matt_37,False
Matt_37,Proxy_of_Death,"Overall, this is good stuff, just will like to expand on somethings

>Eldians are forever free from the Curse of Ymir, but they also lose their (by far) biggest military advantage. That is why Eren saw the rumbling as necessary -

I think it is likely that his plan is much more multifaceted, if not intentional then it is very effective.

First is that the rumbling could also unite the outside world and Eldians as seen in 136. This further expands on why Eren pushed his friends away and made them hate him. By not allowing the SC to take part in this Eren is the perfect scapegoat since he doesn't represent Paradis' government. So there is a way to guarantee Paradis' safety. Also, Magath.

As I have said many times this isn't Lelouch, a better reference will Ozymandias' plan for world peace in Watchmen. There are some differences though.

>And this is the part where I lose most of my yeagerbros - the real world Eren is either already dead (Gabi snipe™), or about to die.

This one I had a problem with. In 120, Zeke said to Eren _I have been waiting for so long Eren, for you to recover and awaken._ It's like I've been sitting here for a year.

So it seems Eren was rebuilt in paths likely by Ymir. Also, I don't think Eren wants to die, I don't think Ymir will let him since he is the only one she has a connection with.

>When Eren and Zeke are going on their Paths adventure, Grisha remarks to Zeke that everything is going to go Eren's way, and asks Zeke to stop Eren.

Grisha saw Zeke because Eren sent him memories of him and he even positioned himself opposite Zeke in 121 to make this possible. I think it was intentional.

 And what do you mean ""where is the brain washing happening?"" How exactly were you expecting the brain washing is supposed to work? Did you expect Marley to strap Eldians into chairs, tape their eyes open, and force them to watch propaganda videos for hours in a dark room until their brains go numb??? Obviously the brain washing takes many forms, one of which is just like racism in real life where its built into every facet of society and effects you subconsciously, how they are mistreated, demonized, and given fake promises of redemption and rewards. Another form is generational bondage. Eldians have been born and raised since a young age to believe that they are devils for generations. It's called indoctrination. And if you are at all familiar with religions or cults, you will know it's a very hard mindset to break once its been planted in your brain.

As for Eren, have some patients and try and use a bit of critical thinking. What do you know of Eren? What are his beliefs? Do those beliefs actually align with Zeke's?

I wouldn’t say the ending is great (there are some things that could’ve been explained better, and some minor twists that seemed unnecessary to me), but the hate is *way* exaggerated. People expected certain things from certain characters, and, to them, the reality was cheaper than what they had in their head (the long wait between chapters probably contributed too). It doesn’t ruin the story by any means though. The only chapter of the manga that is a little below par is the last chapter (the rest are great), so proportionally, it’s really not all that much, and the best parts of attack on Titan were really just living the story with the characters and the themes that were created out of that, and none of that goes away because of the end. It wasn’t terrible, and it can only get better in the anime with the voice-acting, music, clearer action scenes and better translations (even if they don’t edit anything, which they might).

And then is the fact all the dark, gritty, teeth-clenching brutal nature of the manga is totally dropped by an sudden change in direction, with lots of talking and more plotholes created than answered  (Jesus i shiver every time i think of Ymir Fritz and Eren's debacle in character). The result was quite underwhelming and far away from what Yams has been building so far, almost as if written by someone else in the latter chapters.


It's too generic and lacks compromise overall. The anime has the advantage of possessing resources to make the scenes more ""impacting"" to a certain degree, but unless they hange a HUGE chunk of the final stretch it will be as underwhelming as in the original material.

When Falco first comes out from the wreckage, and we see a cgi Erin, and then immediately cut to the animated Falco, it's a little jarring, but at the same time the hand drawn Armin Titan was amazing.

\- Armin explosion looked like a sun and then red sun --> The episode in S3 where Armin gets the colossal is called ""Midnight Sun"".

I never considered this angle, and I had months to notice this as I'm a manga-reader. That's a pretty great observation.

>(unlike luffy were character pretty never evolve, even after traumatic events)

I will never understand why people view Luffy this way. Luffy's character has evolved, especially if you go back and read/watch past chapters/episodes. His core character traits didn't, and he does sometimes fall back into his bad habits, but he is a different character compared to back then. His development is just a bit more slow-paced and subtle.

A similar case of this is World Trigger (a high recommendation, by the way), where the main character, Osamu, grows slowly and subtlely throughout the series.",gkt2iaz,l5553g,attackontitan,2021-01-26 10:13:38,29,3,gkszkr5,despacito11,False

michael-james--,YourBoiiJeff,"I can answer a couple as a anime only,

The kid ymir ate was marcel, the older brother of porco (the new jaw titan) marcel had the jaw titan before ymir amd when she ate him she gained the power, marcel was also the leader of the group (riener, annie, bert). the reason riener wasnt supposed to be selected is because he was the least promising of the candidates, but marcel was hyping him up in a way so that his younger brother (porco) doesnt get chosen(to protect him.)

Eren lost control because it was the second time he transformed, he regained control and doesnt seem to have lost that control since.

Riener suffers from split personality disorder, it's his other personality that misses paradise. (could be more reasons)

Eren and Riener are the same in a lot of ways, but mainly...Riener lived under his enemy's (paradise) for a time and still decided to kill them, Eren did the same thing in Marley, lived with the people and then killed them, I didnt explain this very well, it does much deeper, but that's a basic explanation.

The Military wants Erens titan...everyone wants erens titan, the founding titan is insanely powerful, we dont know too much of what it can do yet, but it is the reason Riess was able to take away memories.",grlkqi4,m8trv9,attackontitan,2021-03-20 16:53:04,2,1,,michael-james--,False

Sure violence can be cyclical however: Marley *didn't* stop the the Titans, the Eldian king did. The Eldian's didn't *constantly* attack Marley to the point they were trapped behind a series of walls to not be fucking eaten. The Eldian's are not engaging in rounding up an entire ethnicity into ghettos, treating them as subhuman, and literally forcing them on suicide runs to attack their enemies.

The Eldian's also didn't declare war *despite* all of the justifications Marley has given them. Once war was declared all bets were off, there were always going to be civilian casualties that's just war. Especially if you look at the history of war where wiping out an entire city was just considered good tactics, it's only our modern sensibilities that have a problem with civilian casualties and even that is very conditional/limited.

Marley is clearly the bad actor here, even to the extent that they literally knew this would happen and were *counting on* the casualties to create a **bigger** conflict.",gjqtt31,kzvmfm,attackontitan,2021-01-18 19:42:15,374,2,gjq37rl,ZukosScar0219,False

But think about this from a military standpoint.

They also have the ability to explode bombs planted all across your country should they choose to.

I think what marley has done is wrong, they have used Eldians as weapons and judge them for their past. I dont know the truth about what Eldians have done. But i do know that in this time they are innocent.

To The point: Either way, all humans have suffered from titans in the past. Thats why they need to put a stop to all founding titans. Theres no way Eren would do something like keeping everyone from having children. It all seems kind off sketchy but Zeke needed to escape being eaten and Eren needed to lure Marley to paradis thats why they did all the things they had to do. 

By luring them to paradis, all the founding titans are all in one place, so Eren and Zeke are going to put an end to everything. They dont care who is in the right or wrong.

Eren is going to fight and eat all founding titans passed down for generations and sacrifice himself so noone can inheriate it again. So if im right the ending is going to be a ""sacrifice your life to become the hero of the world ending"".

vunacar,SuperMoonSensei,"Unpopular opinion, but idk that he's evil. A common theme in the series is how the perception of who's good/bad or right/wrong depends on the perspective and background you've been given up until that point. That's one of the reasons a lot of people are empathizing more with Zeke after the last episode.

The fact still remains though that the world has demonized the Eldians, and the only obvious way to free them from that persecution is to rise up against Marley. Tbh I'm not even sure the rest of the world hates the Eldians like the Marleyans do. Like when Marley gathered the rest of the nation before the declaration of war? Seemed to me they were trying to convince and be sure that the rest of the world would side with them in the conflict.

What if Grisha was right about wanting Eren to be the savior of the Eldians? I'd say the big question is whether or not Eren's will is gonna waver. The Jaegerists are behind Eren because they believe him to be the only one capable of making the tough decision to wage war with Marley despite the fact that there will be a lot of collateral damage/death.

This may sound dumb given the fact that I have no idea how going back the original universe works, so please be kind - but wouldn't it be interesting if the  characters were given the choice of whether they want to leave or not?

If OP's theory is correct, Eren has been working hard to fulfill his promise of killing everyone (which is what's likely going to end their deal and let him go back) so that he *AND* his friends that he so deeply loves can go back ""home"". 

But what if they don't want to?

I imagine that if they (they being Armin, Jean and Connie...I'm not sure where Mikasa stands in this respect) were to find out about how all this was the result of Eren's wish out of boredom and that the AOT universe would still exist once they left, them being the Scouts, wouldn't go with him. Or at the very least, it would be painful for them to. 

I love this theory, but I think it would also be interesting to see them given the choice to leave or stay and be distraught about choosing the easier side of leaving and forgetting, rather than them just disappearing into the orig universe like in muv luv. 

Imagine the heart-wrenching drama! If they leave, they don't have to remember the pain. They get to see Sasha, Marco - their families and friends, alive and well. 

But this also means that all these people in the post rumbling world will continue to exist and bear the consequences of their actions. It would align w most of their character arcs to stay, and even be consistent with the recent character deaths; they'd all give up on their dreams and die. Jean wanted the opportunity to have a happy family, live in comfort; Armin too because then he'd be giving up on his dreams and dying since he doesn't get to see that other world lol; Connie doesn't get to see his family again; this could even conclude Mikasa's arc (mind you, I'm aware I'm slightly biased, if only because I'd be more satisfied in the gut-punch kind of ending where Mikasa lets Eren go rather than them ending up together, so take this w a grain of salt) where she lets go of Eren and doesn't get to stay by his side forever *and* it's her own choice (i'm here for Pain). This discussion could even be part of that final EMA confrontation we're all waiting for! 

It's a very Those Who Walk Away From Omelas kind of moral dilemma and tbh that'd make up for the ""and it was all a dream"" effect of suddenly making a different universe. 

The ending where they all choose to stay can also align with the ANR video, since Eren seems to be the only one to make the transition to the orig universe and he seems to be mourning his friends back in universe 2 (as interpreted by OP)

emmyeggo,Administrative_Leg34,"This totally makes sense! Specially with 'MY WAR' Lyrics

I believe that the girl part is Mikasa and it is about her death. Here's my analysis:

*""I lost my way home. Evening upside down""*

-We all know Eren is Mikasa's ""family"", plus when they first met, Eren invited her back ""home""
- ""Evening upside down"" means she was not on Eren's side

*""With a chime that starts crying, Gradually falling down""*

-In reference with chapter 1, where eren woke up to Mikasa crying.
-""Chime"" is the sound of the leaves, and armin and zeke arc showed what it means to the friend trio.

*""You said you wouldn't let me finish my journey home, its okay to cry, just for now""*
-This  will be Eren killing Mikasa, and Mikasa telling him, its alright we're gonna see each othet again. Thus Mikasa's firshadowing in chapter 1, when eren heard ""see you later"".

*""What is happening along the railroad tracks? How will it bloom again next year?""*

-The railroad, was in reference to the scene where Eren and Mikasa was blushing in front of each other in chapter 108. This symbolizes their romantic feelings for each other, and if they would feel the same the ""next time"" they meet.
-Note that Mikasa is the ""flower"". The purple flower references in the anime, always appear in EreMika moments.

*""If the water is too hot, it will be too cold, If you're feeling drained, open the door to the night""*

-This is like Mikasa saying, if you miss me, you can visit me (through memories)
-""Open the door to the night"" symbolizes the ""paths""

*""You said you would not let me finish alone. Its okay to cry just for now""*

-This is like saying ""You promised to wrap that scarf around me (protect me) but you broke your promise.""

*""There's always tomorrow's lesson anyway,""*

-""You can always change it""

*""... I have to finish my homework and go to bed""*
- ""For now, I finished my duty (as a scout)... and die""

emmyeggo,yaujj36,"I think this theory changes how we look in AoT. The Eren from another universe morphogenetic travel to the AoT world with the start of the timeline, Chapter 1. He had the same personality and memories as AoT’s Eren and not much difference.

This all changed when he kiss Historia’s hand, it is not the royal blood rather by Ymir who sent all the memories Eren lost. This shocked Eren and he despaired over the situation. He knew he wanted to destroy humanity in his original universe. In a way, Eren did changed, he is not the AoT but rather the AoSC one. Like in AoSC, Eren regretted his dream so there are not much difference Eren in AoT world.

He pushed his friends away because I think he saw them as copy of his original universe friends. He did use lies back he meet Mikasa and Armin to justify his distance, maybe when he saw he hated Mikasa, because he saw her as a copy of the one from the original world. Of course he is also trying to train himself to be the villain, the one who destroy humanity on his original dream. We can see all over Marley and War of Paradis arc with him manipulating Zeke, torment his grandfather, goading his friends to attack and setting up the Yeagerists. Maybe Eren using the freedom ideology that his AoT counterpart have to justify his actions. 

Also I seen during the timeskip, Eren have prepare to be war with the world as seen in the shooting range. He is also seen cynical of the chance of peace, besides Eren wanted the world to be hostile at Paradis to give reason/excuse to destroy humanity. He also have a limited time gap to commit his action, that why he refused the 50 years plan not only to save Historia. He is not going through Marley conquest on Paradis despite different administration or Zeke's euthanization plan to go through as it seen to be time wasted spent in this world and clearly did not give a damn of consequences. Like in Eternal Champion, he wanted to slaughter his opponents as soon as possible and regret later, I think this is Eren's only way out of this cruel world that he wished. 

However, he still have emotions over his AoT friends and genuinely cared. I think Eren felt sorry for Ymir because he wished for the world in order to achieve his dream. In 131 where Kid Eren admiring the freedom, I think that is AoT Eren enjoying his dream, a somewhat kindness of the AoSC Eren to give AoT Eren the dream he wanted. Also in 853 in the train track, he did not want the Founding Titan to be passed on to his friends and don't want them to suffer the same fate as himself. After all knowing this world is created so Eren can destroy humanity can sent anyone to depression.

Also with Eren wishing the world, it made me switched perspective on Fritz I, he may be a cruel megalomaniac psychopath, but he is the devil that Eren asked for to create the world Eren desired. I haven't thought how Eren contact the devil but I ignored this for now. We know making deals with devils are unstable since the devil can name any price they want, so I am sure the devil wanted something harmful in exchange. Well I did thought of the parasite but this will derail the story we are talking about so I will skip. The devil disguise himself as Fritz I and uses Ymir to create the world Eren desired. When Ymir is in the Paths, he offer her a deal, freedom from the Paths in exchange on helping Eren to destroy humanity.",gmjtf5h,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-08 05:43:23,15,1,,emmyeggo,False

Yes you heard that right Isayama typically likes to have groups of friends consisting of 2 boys and 1 girl- examples are Eren Mikasa and Armin, Levi Erwin and Hange, Reiner Bertolt and Annie and then Jean Connie and Sasha now don’t get me wrong I completely understand all of these characters are friends aswell but you can’t deny the bond between 3 characters as 1 group is a lot more Prominent than the rest and I’ve noticed when 1 character dies or something bad happens the rest of the Group crumble aswell and it was right under our noses from the start when Eren first transformed into a Titan after being eaten we saw Armin and Mikasa become Suicidal in a sense and have no point in living demonstrated by Mikasa using all her gas knowing damn well she couldn’t make it but she was ok with dying because Eren did Armin also requested Mikasa leaves a blade with him so he could finish himself off. Or When Erwin died Levi and Hanges attitude completely changed Levi didn’t want to fight anymore and Hange died recently as we know. Same goes for Bertolt after he died Reiner was filled with instant regret and as he said just wanted to die peacefully. Same after Sasha died Connie and Jeans attitude changed Connie got to the point where he almost seemed like he wanted to die when he was dangling from Erens rib bone. Basically what I think Isayama is getting at is that these groups of 3 are important by this I mean once 1 person in the group dies the rest are guaranteed to follow them to their grave so based off this Judgement I’ve came to the conclusion of who I believe will survive and who will die in the finale 
Deaths - Connie Levi Jean Reiner Annie 
Survivors - Mikasa Armin Gabi Falco Eren 
This is based purely on the fact Isayama hasn’t touched the main group of 3 basically at all and when he does there is next to no chance they lose the fight yes I do believe the alternate universe ending theory is most likely but I feel that Isayama wants us to recognise the power of building strong relationships with others can have.",gnpn7yr,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-17 01:57:48,4,1,,emmyeggo,False

The sun part is shown if you go back to the last Episode of season 3 part 1 the night before the battle to retake wall maria. obviously its night time as it says in the title and we can see reiner and bertolt sitting on the wall facing north with the sun shining to their right side (east)

As for how we know they are looking north its because we see they are facing away from  Shiganshina and we know from the very first episode that titans attack from the south so them looking direct at the foot of the mountain can only mean they are looking north",gnkcka9,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-15 20:33:11,19,1,,emmyeggo,False

If Eren has seen only **fragmented future memories** of this event, where Tybur gives a speech and Renier begs, it's possible he wasn't expecting Tybur to say ""this world"" and was caught off guard by the phrasing.

“In numerology the 139 symbolizes the end of something and the beginning of something else. In other words, the “death” of one thing and the rebirth of another. The 139 symbolizes an important change, which can be in the right or wrong direction.”

It’s possible that “Attack on Titan” as a world dies/ends on chapter 139, since it’s fulfilled its purpose by being destroyed. Then something would be rebirthed as a result, ie: the Attack on School Castes world, or something else.

So then it’s possible we get more after 139 from a “rebirth”? Prob not, but it’s interesting to think about.",gm9qi1g,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-06 21:38:09,15,1,,emmyeggo,False

emmyeggo,sokidan,"I went back and reread some of the beginning of the manga after having gone through your theory earlier today, and Mikasa is much more peculiar than I remembered. There's a lot of strange things she says and feels, but one thing that stood out to me is in Chapter 7, when she believes she will die, she remembers Eren's words to fight and also him sleeping at the Ch.1 tree, and then thinks, ""I'm sorry Eren, I can't give up. If I die, I won't even be able to remember you"". What does that mean? Why was she apologizing for continuing to fight? I find that really odd. Does it have something to do with these alternate universes and Mikasa's role in each of them? I don't know what to make of it at all, but it is interesting to reread all this with the theory in mind.

Also forgive me if I'm stupid and this bit was explained later in the manga. It's been a long time sine I've read these older chapters",gob6s86,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-22 06:23:07,5,1,,emmyeggo,False

Eren wished for the AOT story to happen while he lived in a parallel universe, he made a deal with Ymir though the deal would only be completed if he actually manages to ""Destroy humanity"" and become the enemy of the world he lives in. So if doesn't manage to get there the universe resets to it's start point which is ep1 and then you can basically insert the time loop theory (https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lxy1q5/most_probable_ending_theory_youll_ever_read/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) which adds some interesting points and actually fits nearly perfect into this one I would only use your ending which is more fitting, I especially liked the parralel grisha - Eren whit the new life without memories.

On top of that, the final exchange between them in Volume 32 is 

Ymir appears before Eren.

Eren says “The one and only god Ymir has bestowed upon me her message!! Now all of humanity will be saved!!”

emmyeggo,InAsianSpaces,"Okay, I'm not going to lie when I started reading I was like ""yeah, right"" but by the end of it...it does make a lot of sense.

It would explain Eren saying that when he learned that humanity existed beyond the walls he was ""disappointed"". 

And it would explain the ""You started this story, didn't you"" right along with the ""Because I was born into **this** world"" line that Eren, Wily, Zeke, etc have said before. And the common theme.

And if that's true about Mikasa not having a memory wipe, it would explain her ""Ackerman genes"" activating - meaning her true power of knowing the truth of their world activating. That raises the stakes on her being unsure if Eren and herself will die forever if something happens, which is why she is so overprotective of him - she just wants to go home and return to their normal life.

(I wonder if this carries over to Levi as well. And to a certain extent, Kenny...since he wanted to be a serial killer in the capital.)

Man...this really would hurt a lot of Isayama's readers. I've never cared for Mikasa like that, but if she's the only one who knew the truth of **this** ""cruel, yet beautiful"" world...that'd be so fucked.

Over 10+ years living in a nightmare that Eren wished for, only for him to find out towards the end of his contract with Ymir...That still wouldn't explain what exactly Ymir is though. 

But if she was a slave in Eren's world...the Attack Titan's story...then maybe he saved her because she gave him the power in that world. He's the Earth Devil set to destroy it, and she was just an ordinary girl changed by unassuming circumstances in her character backstory...similar to Eren in the actual real world of HS Castes.

&#x200B;

Either way, very fascinating theory. I completely see the story differently now, and it's not a bad thing. All of the classroom stuff rferences and random Mikasa outbursts make perfect sense now. 

Or Mikasa's pained expression in that chapter when Eren goes to yell at Mikasa and Armin and then beats Armin up. When he throws a punch at Eren (or tries) Mikasa basically body slams him and then looks surprised and ashamed of herself. Maybe it was her reflex or ""Ackerman instincts"" (in that world) to protect him because she really wants to go home and he's her ticket out of there as well.

Like she wants to tell Armin the truth, but can't. And Eren won't listen to her.

Not to mention, I always thought the Tybur children's school uniforms were out of place. 

I recently re-watched Ep 22 of S3 to look at what flashbacks came true so far in season 4 and thought it was odd. Would make perfect sense if Eren was getting mixes of both the real world and his 'fantasy' Eldian life on Paradis....as the Earth Devil from Paradise who destroys the world.",gni5wi3,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-15 05:55:23,6,1,,emmyeggo,False

UH. No Muv-Luv Alternative is the third part of a trilogy and Muv-Luv Extra plays an important role in establishing the characters and themes. and the events of Extra directly tie into the plot of Alternative. Alternative calls back to very specific events from Extra that become important later on, so obviously you're supposed to read Extra. so no, you can't simply just read Alternative without reading Extra (and by extension Unlimited). all the worldbuilding and set-up and foreshadowing throughout Extra and Unlimited is 100% necessary to the story of Alternative. *that's how trilogies work.*

additionally, Muv-Luv was originally planned out and written as one overarching story. Alternative is not seperate from Extra and Unlimited. all three titles form one complete narrative.

So I fear this ending would feel extremely cheap to them (and some manga readers too) unless of course chapter 138 or 139 are super long and detailed and put all the loose ends to rest. Which I honestly believe Isayama can pull off. However if Isayama does not pull off this ending perfectly this would receive mass backlash and I would be very disappointed. So to wrap it up I hope Isayama continues to do Isayama things and doesn't screw this up!

emmyeggo,whatisgoingonpeople,"Hey, I left a comment yesterday about how some things did not add up to this theory. Today, I reread chapter 137, and I concluded that there is an ALTERNATIVE WORLD in AOT. However, it is not the world you are talking about. The alternative world is nothing other than THE PATHS. At the beginning of chapter 137, Zeke mentions how Ymir Fritz gave birth to something stronger, larger, to an undying body. Then he added “She escaped to a WORLD that was free... of even death.” Armin then asks “Isn’t there some way of getting back to the outside WORLD from here?” The time when Eren tells Ymir that he will put an end to THIS WORLD, he did not mean any world other than THE PATHS it self. He wants to put an end to the WORLD of suffering that Ymir lived in for the past 2,000 years... This is what came up to my mind when I reread the chapter, what do you think about it??",gn54moy,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-13 05:58:20,5,1,,emmyeggo,False

emmyeggo,whatisgoingonpeople,"I really enjoyed reading about this theory, however I would be disappointed if it happened. I am unsure if someone will end up reading my comment here, but I found few things that did not add up to this theory. Here they come:

1) As we all know, Armin is the narrator of the story. If he were to go back to the AU, he would forget all about what happened. So, how come he still remembers the events of the Attack on Titan world?? I know some may argue that he will sacrifice himself and stay in the AOT world, but that does not make sense... Armin was always a character that looks for peace. He wants to be able to live in peace and harmony with people from all around the world. This theory would COMPLETELY RUIN all the hardship Armin went through to achieve piece. YES, HE WENT THROUGH HARDSHIP, it is really hard to keep that peaceful mentality in a world filled with hatred and suffering.

2) As I understood from the theory, the part with kids in Uniform is supposedly to be in the AU. Well, I do not think this is the case. If you actually pay attention to colours used in that scene, you will be able to see a yellowish flash, which is the same flash that appears during the transformation to a titan. I have a theory for this scene, maybe the world ends up living in piece with the Eldians. The part where the flash appears, a girl had a really shocked expression on her face (because she saw a human transforming into a titan??). Also on their Uniform, there is a fallen bird symbol, which appeared in S4 opening (My War). I think this is a symbolism to honour the ""fallen"" or people who have sacrificed themselves in order to achieve the peace the world is in right now. 

That is all of what came up to my mind reading this theory for now... 

I tried to make my point short and sweet, but apparently I have written a mini essay. Thank you for reading up to this point.",gn1b0rk,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-12 08:20:16,2,1,,emmyeggo,False

emmyeggo,ijustwannadielol,"This is very convincing, I’ll give you that. However, to me there’s some parts of your theory that you’re taking out of context to fit your theory.

For example, when Armin talks about wanting to still believe that there is still a world out there that they don’t know about, he’s talking about the paths realm and the people still living in it. Same with the chapter 122, it is just hinting at the paths universe with the parasite.

Eren saying “I’m putting an end to this world” means ending paths and thus the Titan curse and pure titans.

Mikasa telling Armin that he’s saved them before is referring to Armin telling Hannes about Mikasa and Eren needing rescue when Carla was crushed.

i did suspect before that multiple universes could be at work.  my previous theory was that Eren would eat all nine titans (Armin included last), become the living embodiment of Ymir Fritz the founder, then send memories back thousands of years to the original Ymir before she made the deal with the devil, showing her the millennia of the cursed history of the eldian race and convincing her not to take the deal.  then he wakes up with everyone around him he knows in a world where titans never existed, and ""eldians"" are just humans.  im sure you could comb the chapters for supporting evidence if you tried

emmyeggo,YaBoiDanish,"I really like how much evidence there is for this theory, though there are a few parts of this theory that kinda bother me:
1 In chapter 131, we can clearly see Eren temporarily being conflicted about if genociding the world really should be done. He even says that killing only the people inside the walls would result in less deaths than if he went full rumbling, but he quickly refutes that idea saying that he can't accept that. This to me seems like he does the rumbling for the sake of Paradis, not to fulfill his supposed 'mission' that'd take him back to the schoolverse. Also, what counts as destroying humanity? Only the people outside the walls? Shouldn't the walldians also count as humanity, thus needing to be destroyed?
2 Supposedly, Eren made the deal with Ymir in the schoolverse, but when? Eren does wish for a more entertaining world, but he never directly said it to Ymir. The only two times he met Ymir was seeing her while talking to Falco and Gabi and the other time was when Ymir told her how to save humanity(I might me misremembering this), which was cleaning yourself. There's no way Eren made the deal in any of these interactions. Also, he wished for it at first, but after getting an experience of something that is not as boring as his normal life(kidnapping), he clearly regrets it and even wishes he never thought about it. If Eren made the deal sometime after those 2 encounters with Ymir, it wouldn't make a licker of sense tbh.
Anyways, that's all I have to say. This theory is really wel made and I can clearly see how much effort went into this. Though, if I'm gonna be honest, I wouldn't like this ending, mainly because every person in SnK that isn't Eren had motivations and goals that in the end, amounted to nothing, as they were just born into a world purely meant for Eren to destroy it. I think this ending focuses too much on Eren alone. I'd like an ending that focuses on all the (surviving) main cast with all their arcs completed. You said something that with this theory, you can also add your other theory and it'd would perfectly fit, but imo, adding this theory on top of the actual end of the SnK world that we know of would strip of a lot of meaning and would make the world feel very empty.

Appreciate you responding to my questions. Very interesting and you’ve just fuelled my desire and desperation to learn the ending even more. This is so torturing!! I really enjoyed and can’t help but be impressed with you validating your points in this hypothesis. 

I don’t deny that the possibility of EH baby is there. It’ll be a little lame if it turns out to be just nothing but red herring. But...but...I still don’t want that though, cos at least from what’s revealed so far, it’ll be an out-of-character decision for Eren the way I see it. He didn’t want to recognise Mikasa’s feelings because he only had 4 years left, yet he could father a child with Historia? Moreover, like I said, I’m still not convinced that there are circumstances for the duo to have a kid to happen. I guess we’ll know more after C137. 

I’m not familiar with Muv Luv, but are you saying that the ending of that anime/manga further cements a possible ending for EH in the AoT universe? Ok but ☹️

I’ve actually tried to find some traces of possible endings by watching AoT live action movies. Because Isayama said that despite it being a standalone story, the movie will have elements from the original manga. It may not be anything but the movie did end with Eren and Mikasa looking on to the world that they had discovered after scaling the wall. 🤷🏻‍♀️",gm878m4,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-06 14:05:05,2,3,gm82rp5,emmyeggo,False

Let’s just go by your theory, I have a few of questions though; 

1) So did Eren and friends travelled to the alternate universe with him or is it just him? 

2) Why and how did he travel? He just made it happen because he wished for something to happen? 

3) Why must Eren fathered Historia’s baby? He definitely doesn’t like/love her, so I concluded if he is the father, there has to be a reason for that choice. What is that reason if what you’re hypothesising is correct?

I’d be thrilled if you can clear my doubts. 😁

emmyeggo,ATOMate,"So after reading all this I wanna give my thought. Firstly I wanna commend you for doing this.  

The panel with the shard memories is indeed interesting. Even with his comment of wanting to link the school universe to the current one, I could still very much see this being just an easter egg-manga panel could still just be an easter egg.

You touch on the fact that Eren and Mikasa specifically talk about ""this world"" and not just ""the world"". I honestly do not see much of anything in there. Saying ""this world"" is reasonable and in the context of sounding dramatic it is a perfectly viable choice of words.

The fact that Eren can alter memories of past Attack Titan users does not imply the existence of alternate universes in my opinion. I see AoT as the type of story, where every alteration of the past has already happened and was always destined to happen. This allows the story to still be within one singular timeline and have no branches. A story that can branch off often feels pointless because one timeline will always be saved and another is probably doomed.  Multiple timelines of the same universe significantly lower the impact of everything that happens in one timeline. From a story telling perspective it is a huge risk to go down that route. So I really do believe that AoT does not jump timelines when Eren alters the past.

Another point I wanna touch upon is Historias baby. If we do in fact jump to an alternate reality in the end, I do not see that Historias baby story line going anywhere. It'd be a lose end to me. You mentioned the parallel to Grisha, of Eren getting a second chance in said alternate reality with Mikasa. But I just don't see tat working out, the mini cliffhanger of Historias baby would be abandoned and not feel satisfying to me. Maybe some extra scenes with her could fix this minor issue I have, but I do not quite see that happening.

The image of Ymir and the Devil looks quite significant. But is it really? I tried to find the scene of the anime where it was shown, but I couldn't find it. I remember this scene being used to explain the origins of the titan and Ymir. (Somewhere around the end of season 3 I think) Again, this based on my memory alone. Was this not used as the explanation to how Ymir got her original titan powers? ""A deal with the devil"" This was mere specualtion. No one except Ymir, and now probably Eren, knew how Ymir got her powers. So it was just assumed that it must have been a deal with a devil. This picture does not necessarily reflect reality. Gotta check that scene again, to confirm this though

&#x200B;

What I do find very interesting are the opening and ending lyrics. My god, they are just way too specific to not mean anything. We did have the entire Ymir story in the Season 2 ending after all. These things aren't just songs with funny pictures. So I do believe Isayama defintely wants the school universe to be part of his story line. 

Now having said that, I do think that it is possible that the school universe will not be part of the main manga story line. It could be type of thing we speculate about for years to come. Leaving some things to be interpreted and analysed sounds like the Isayama thing to do to me.

emmyeggo,Grantg543,"Hello, this theory was from awhile ago but a question randomly popped up in my head about it. I would love this ending actually, but am not sure about this part:

How would this theory connect to eren’s encounter with ymir in paths? Ymir seems to be a slave to fritz and stays with him because she’s connected to the world, and eren understood that and gave her freedom to choose to end this world or stay in it for eternity. It freed her and showed her true human interaction for the first time.

If she’s the one that created the world under Eren’s wish, why would there be this connection? If it was pure suffering, would she not resent eren for the deal, and how does it connect to sending eren a message 2k years later for him to free her?

If the shard of memory (castes AU) that Eren sees is so important for the development of the ending then i have a couple of questions...

1. Why Isayama did not introduce the AU in the first chapters of the manga to familiarize the readers to it

2. Why didn't he introduce the AU within the main story and not at the end of every volume?

3. why we haven't seen anything related to the AU in the anime.

4. If the fragment of AU (armin and mikasa) is important then shouldn't it be bigger and more centrally located on the page instead of being tiny and in a corner?

5. Explain to us the existence of Ymir as a God in the AU and why it seems that Eren is the only one who can see her?

6. In the AU why would Ymir make Eren wish of destroying the world  come true in the first place? What does she gain from doing so?

Since you wrote so much, some parts of your theory may come true and/or have similarities to the actual ending so you would make yourself feel better by saying ""I was at least right about this"".

You need to learn parsimony. Which is the simplest answer is usually the correct one.

3) He could simply fell in love with Titan world's version of Historia, while in the original world he  loves Mikasa. This might be a parallel for Grisha's life in the Titan world, marrying two different people from different places. In Eren's case, he loves two different people from different worlds.

I fear that a part 2 with all these chapters left will be even worse for them if they don't get at least 1 year for it.

Funny that you mentioned GoT because thats similar to how A dance with dragons ends right before we get the climax to any of the three main arcs (North, Mereen and kings landing).

In the end it doesnt really matter because we will definitely get S4P2 within two years max where as we have been waiting for The winds of winter for almost ten years, I just think ending in the middle of an arc is pretty weird.

However with the way Isayama has portrayed the two, for me, I really hope there’s a really reasonable reason why Historia’s kid inherited the Beast Titan. If Eren and Historia were really planning for her or THEIR child to inherit a Titan power, they are no better than Rod, Karina, Mr. Leonhart. They would essentially be using her kid for a tool and one of the main things Isayama has been trying to drill into us is to not let children be used for any sort of plan. Eren and Historia would be by far the WORST characters to do that, Eren for all the times he’s protected Historia’s from becoming a Titan and his constant rejection of her using her own kid, Historia for obvious reasons. Isayama would butcher their characters more than he already has this final arc.

Eventually he exists outside of time, so it wouldn't really matter *when* he received the powers. In one sense he's always had them.

GidgetSpinner,len_slibinas,"Hello, I really  liked your analysis. While I  wasn't initially onboard with Eren basically killing his own mother, it does make sense of some things.

I have read up through Chapter 138 and am up to date on the anime, so there might be  spoilers though my focus will be on an earlier section.  

With little time left I'm not sure if this will be resolved but it is still interesting to think about. First, despite my trying not to get too attached to anyone, Bertholdt became  my favorite  character, second  my favorite part is basically just before Utgard Castle up to Ymir, Bertholdt and Reiner recovering on the wall.   

Anyway, I always thought it strange how Bertholdt answers Eren's question when he asked him what Bertholdt was thinking when he told him how his mother died. Bertholdt gives him a long look and then replies,  ""At the time, I felt sorry for you."" (some translations  have  him say ""Back then""  or  ""In the moment"").  The specific way he phrases it  seems to imply that he  actually did feel bad for him at the time, but something changed since then and that is no longer the case.  Tied with the memory shard theory  it  could mean that Bertholdt has seen something, possibly that even Eren hasn't at that time and that is basically Eren took part in his mother's death.

While I'm not sure how Bertholdt would know this, it seems different titans have different abilities on the paths. I think possibly  the bearer of the Colossal is at times aware of  the guilt or sins in the past, present, and even future.  However the bearer is also burdened with the inability to do anything about them, and that the combination of the two weighs down on them. I thought maybe Bertholdt became aware of  what Eren did just before his transformation on the wall. In the anime version at least, he and Eren seem to have a moment where they are just staring into each other's eyes before it cuts to Reiner.  In the manga, it's a little different since it goes Bertholdt, Reiner, and then Eren.

I  don't think Eren really knew what Bertholdt was saying until he touched Dina's titan and then became aware of his own guilt in the matter and as he mourns Hannes he is also crying at what he has done.

I  also wonder if  maybe Armin had seen this in Bertholdt's memories.  He  seems to  be lying to  Eren when Eren asks him if he saw something in those memories and he says nothing significant.  Initially it just seemed that his crush on Annie has him basically spying on her in those moments,  but if he had seen either  Dina aka the smiling titan walking away from Bertholdt at the gate or he had seen what Bertholdt had  seen in Eren back then he might be  hesitant to share  this  information. 

Reiner also says that  of all the people to have the coordinate, that Eren is by far the worst. I don't know if that is a personal judgement  of character by him or if this is something the armored titan can figure out along the paths.  Fun note, the name Reiner means judgement warrior or deciding warrior,

Anyway, usually when Bertholdt says something odd it tends to make some sense later and the way he said, ""At the time, I  felt sorry for you,"" is a bit strange and I thought maybe there would be more of a resolution to it.",gqhtvnl,koudut,titanfolk,2021-03-10 22:19:16,4,1,,GidgetSpinner,False

JockyCracker,curiousCat1009,"Yeagerist fan but also an Isayama defender here. My take is this. Eren is still selfish. He is not doing this to save Paradis. He neither cares about humanity or the people of Paradis. He says he is doing this for the people of Paradis and he wants to end the humans outside the walls.

It's strange because Eren doesn't act like Paradis saviour - he didn't stop the pure titans from running rampant. He probably used Floch and the Yeagerists for their nationalism. Some of Floch's ideals are too extreme to have been instilled by Eren. Or rather his interpretation of Eren's ideals is...

 But what he really wants is

1. Historia and her(more likely their) baby safe
2. His friends to live long lives

The rumbling is stopped. The alliance are regarded as heroes. Also the curse of Ymir is ended. Armin, Mikasa and the others will be Gods in the eyes of the world outside. Remember the Tyburs? Eldians and titan shifters yet the most powerful people in Marley. Regardless of the change in sentiment towards Eldians or the ""Devils"" of Paradis, his friends are safe. 

Now, Historia and her baby are also free. How? Paradis is certainly not free from the danger of getting wiped out in the future if the outside world decides to end them all. But Paradis would never hide behind Historia or her baby because of their royal blood. Their fates and Paradis future are no longer entwined. No one will try to sacrifice Historia or her child because there is no founder or titans. If the world does come for them, they will fight or run.

Historia fake banishes Mikasa, Armin and the others, so now they help the world rebuild. They start a new life. Armin would have no problem - he has Annie. Jean has Pieck?? Mikasa goes to Hizuru and reclaims her birthright. Levi opens a Monke themed teashop. Connie becomes Lord Cornelius Springer the First after marrying a hot Marleyan noblewoman and arranges for his mom to join him in Marley.

With the baby storyline, the anime cut 2 big clues (the hooded figure, whose identity would've been far too obvious in color, and Historia not marrying the farmer) and I've seen a ton of anime-onlies who already doubt that the farmer is the father and think it could be Eren. Once 130 is animated, the number of people who think that will grow exponentially. Cutting out the due date likely won't harm the mystery since I doubt anyone who is an anime-only would even remember that line by the time Historia gives birth in the anime (whenever that is) or realize that she's giving birth just a few days after Levi said that. Hell, not even a lot of manga readers realize that.

I think from just the part the anime already adapted and chapter 130, there will already be enough to foreshadow the twist if it happens and anyone who doesn't hate the ship with a passion for whatever reason should be able to see it as a possibility at least by the time 130 is adapted.

Now this an exaggeration because while I didn't like the CGI, I still loved the episode and found that the CGI gets easier to look at the more you do it. 

It's impossible to expect an animation with a perfect budget because life is messy, and MAPPA is the only studio willing to pick up this series.

mashijams,limblessbaby,"1) there was no other better way to explain titan powers, this is still a fiction so you have to give writers leeways when it comes to stuff like that. 

2) very subjective, but how else do you think the battle could have gone? There are no additional powerups that I'm aware of that took place, eren is the founding titan so doesn't it make sense that he's invincible? This contradicts why he's losing atm but hopefully 139 will clear it up 

3) yes yams has gone out of his way to write eren off for alliance to develop, but 131 did show that eren is so broken he reverted to his childlike self to avoid feeling the guilt. And i think eren's current pov has been kept a mystery for a good reason and if that reason isn't gold enough from what we get in 139, yams deffo fucked up.

4) literally the opposite. The previous seasons relied on shit characters and incredible story and mysteries. Post timeskip aot relies on well written eren, reiner, zeke, grisha, gabi, falco, floch and hange. Some characters were sidelined and that's a valid criticism but to suggest that the previous seasons handled characters better is just wrong imo. Also this is the point that actually triggered me into writing this long ass response. 

5) final arc contains moments of tension and plot twists, why is this a criticism? Aot has relied on shock value since the beginning, like most works of fiction.

6) falco evolving like pokemon doesn't make too much sense. Agreed. Hange died trying to save the world and after sacrificing herself. Would you have rather hange died by an anonymous ancient shifter? Where would the sacrifice be if she was to die after reaching eren? Sacrifice is a common theme and it makes sense for the commander of sc to sacrifice herself.

mashijams,Mint_Choco7,"I agree with all your points. It’s interesting because I guess those criticisms are weighted differently? What you said is why I just can’t bring myself to like the arc. I’ll just comment on a few of your points:

2/5. Putting the physical fighting aside, the “this isn’t even my final form” is actually pretty on brand for Yams. Even the paths chapters, which are right regarded as one of the best stretches in the manga, suffers from this if you look close enough. Taking the plot twist that 121 provided away, those chapters were just Eren and Zeke pulling multiple uno reverses on each other.

4. Agreed. I like most if not all if my favorite characters less because of this arc. I’m still hoping that 139 can fix Eren but if not idk.

7. What makes this so infuriating is the lack of Eren, otherwise I wouldn’t mind.

8. I really hope this isn’t the case lol. Ymir acting so strange gives me some hope but idk how much we can expect from 45 pages. It would backpedal on all the claims fans have made about aot being so great because there’s no villain. The cycle of hatred conflict was amazing because there was no “big bad” you could just defeat to get rid of it but if that’s what’s happening now it would be a shame.",gr10sbt,m5nz3h,titanfolk,2021-03-15 17:34:54,5,1,,mashijams,False

\-Callback to Eren telling Mikasa to ""fight to win / live"" when she awakened her ackerman abillities in S1 EP6

\-Who influenced Eren to kill the slavetraders to save Mikasa in the first place

\-Reiner and Gabi also reuniting with their family and friends. It seems Zophia's family is there. They seem to be flying to the fort at the end of 135 cause they're so far away from Eren at that point.

\-Panels of Historia birthing 1-3 children. Personally I want to see her have triplets because she already parallels Ymir so much, even though Ymir had 3 children over time instead of at the same time. 2 will die, 1 will survive, just like wall Maria and Rose was breached (if you count Rose) and Sina / Sheena was not.

You mentioned Ackerman Origin so I'd put Royal Bloodline Origin too, because I speculate Maria started that one and Sina / Sheena started the Ackerman one.

\-Explanation for Mikasa's headaches

\-What Eren saw when he ate the warhammer. Tybur secrets? ancient history? a crucial piece of the puzzle?

\-The role of fate in the story and whether Ymir was bound by it too. It seems very likely. After all, Isayama just released a drawing of Ymir and pigs that has the words: ""A girl has a dream. She dreams of a world free from curses and fate.""

Something I would like to see:

A chapter called ""To you, 2000 years ago"" about Grisha knowing that Eren's way will happen and that it will be a disaster, so he uses royal blood to influence Kruger who then influences the previous attack titan shifter, which goes all the way back to the first one, either Ymir or Sina / Sheena I believe. And that's when she makes the Ackerman bloodline, for the sole reason and purpose to stop future Eren.

Kruger being Annie's grandfather. It checks out if Annie's mother had an early birth, and they look alike in some shots, but that's just a personal wish cause I think it would be cool to have at least one panel showing it. Maybe Kruger was bound by fate to save Annie just like Eren had to save Mikasa.

\-Annie using her Crystalization ability on Eren again. While Eren was in his flaming titan in S1 EP25, it was the only thing that made him scared. And he only barely escaped because Levi cut him out. So I wish she used it again and maybe that explains him looking petrified in the S4 OP.

BenCoHU,AnElmCalledV,"The Colossal / Armored reveal in Clash is always up there, and the anime definitely improved upon it. That said I just really enjoyed the first half of that arc anyway. 

The whole span of 107 - 117 is fun since it doesn’t have much action yet manages to keep up the intense vibe and pacing through only character drama, and it’s done well. Sure, it was a bit hard to follow as it came out, but reading back on it clears a lot of things up

Despite its unpopularity I still love Falco’s Jaw Titan. It’s the dumbest, most obvious thing yet it still came out of the blue

I also love a lot of the minor panels, just characters joking around with each other, or well drawn ones of my favorite characters

Anime-wise, I really, really love the music.",h0fpq2y,nr89x1,AttackOnRetards,2021-06-03 15:21:27,4,1,,BenCoHU,False

BenCoHU,luigi-brocchi,"Eren internal monologue when he close Trost's hole. (I still have goosebumps)  
Mikasa internal monologue after Eren fake death, when she find another meaning in her life, a reason to fight! (that moment give me strenght)  
Historia refusing his father injection, remembering Ymir last, selfish, desire. (what a moment)  
Kenny speech to Levi! (Masterpiece)  
Erwin Charge/Declaration of War (you know why)  
AND MY FAVORITE MOMENT:  
Armin speech to Zeke in Paths! That moment change my perspective on life, I was always about fulfilling my dream of becoming a voice actor, I couldn't accept failure, I always acted like if i failed my life would be meaningless. Thanks to that conversation I have a new view, I can finally accept any outcome to my story. And now I am even more determined to achieve my goal!

BenCoHU,groceryl1st,"All of RTS was solid, but my favourite moment from the top of my head is when Eren hugs Ymir in PATHS. I think that singular moment summed up all the pain collectively suffered by Eldians, especially those burdened to be Titan shifters. 

Chapter 138 also gives me shivers. I am a sucker for full-circle stories and the fact that EM was requited all along was just sad AF.",h0faj7t,nr89x1,AttackOnRetards,2021-06-03 12:51:51,3,1,,BenCoHU,False

I totally get having problems with it but considering how comically terrible everything is and that our beloved characters are essentially leaving for a mission they can’t survive, all to it culminating in one of their most horrible enemies they haven’t seen in 4 years as just a comical, frantic mess?

RusselAxel,lucv2004,"You missed my point entirely. I was saying I’ve read many other manga and anime and in most of them the romance is very clear cut. Take for example Ed and Winry’s relationship in FMA:B, a *Japanese shonen manga* made for the same audience as AoT. It’s a romance where both sides’ feelings are clear and mutual. Hell, the other romances in AoT itself are very, very obvious. Ymir and Historia clearly loved each other. Same with Falco and Gabi, and funnily enough it was conveyed in the least subtle way possible. In EM’s case, Eren’s feelings for her are very confusing up until chapter 139. 


Also, aren’t multiple, diverse points of view important in objective criticism? Why should only Japanese people be allowed to criticise a manga? Extrapolating from your logic, you shouldn’t consume any media unless you’re the exact target audience for it.",h32e6yi,o7q2zd,AttackOnRetards,2021-06-26 04:28:27,6,3,h30vvwx,RusselAxel,False
RusselAxel,lucv2004,"I fully agree with your objectivity argument, but the ""it's just the Japanese way of romance"" argument crumbles once you read any other manga, or japanese media in general. Berserk's romance between Guts and Casca is subtle, but I still notice mutual affection and care between them. There are no extravagant displays of their love, but all their romantic moments come off as completely genuine. With EM, I see none of that. All their moments are just Mikasa loving him and Eren giving her none back (sans two scenes, one in 50 and one in 123). I still believe EM was always endgame because of the whole red-string of fate bullshit, but Isayma executed it in a terrible way.",h30klkb,o7q2zd,AttackOnRetards,2021-06-25 19:12:38,6,1,,RusselAxel,False
RusselAxel,Dependent-Rice-7308,"I see and can agree in some level but the manga industry has been international long before aot was created, and japanese culture isn't very present in it, not in the themes or in the ambient.The main themes of aot aren't constricted in one culture, they are very global: japan isn't the only country that got trough war,hate,discrimination,desire for freedom . There is a theme of gaining freedom/independence in old japanese folklore but the way it's portrait is very different.If  Yams intent was to create something only for his country he did it in a very bad way",h31fo9o,o7q2zd,AttackOnRetards,2021-06-25 23:13:02,2,1,,RusselAxel,False
