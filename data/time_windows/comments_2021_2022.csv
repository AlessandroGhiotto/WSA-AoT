I am willing to be patient if they can give the show the love and dedication they have in its entirety so far.

Them announcing another season is perfect for the anime, but people are now angry that they have to wait ? Like is this sub filled with 15 year olds year with no concept of how things work ?

When MAPPA started working on Season 4, back in 2019, Manga hadn't ended, they probably discussed with everyone and decided that Final season should be more than enough to wrap things up, and It changed as time went along, I am glad that along the way they elongated it even if it meant some kids would be whining about 'oMg tHe wAiT' instead of rushing it.

There is really no winning here, the toxicity here is so sad and pathetic.

Like, imagine if they had all original intentions to wrap everything in 2 cours. They decide to market it as the ""final season"" because that's what it will be. Doing multiple cours is not atypical.

But once they realized they had production issues, they opted to prioritize the quality and break things down to give animators more time and do more justice. However, it's two late to go back and change marketing that has already been released into the world.

Hindsight is 20-20. It probably seemed reasonable to them initially to wrap everything up in 2 cours. Would you have preferred them to rush it and give us substandard quality? I'd rather take some ""misleading"" marketing over rushed production resulting in shitty quality.

The primary point I'm trying to make here is that the misleading marketing mistake only needed to happen once in the past. They're not intentionally being manipulative every single time after that because it's too late to change your mind at that point.

How this ‚Äúladylike‚Äù ideal Ymir was juxtaposed with mega- masculine violent rage Eren in this episode. 

I see commentary on more broad ideals of masculinity and femininity (more in a yin/yang way than literal gender) through Ymir‚Äôs and Erens relationship/ connection. 

Ymir just wanted to ‚Äúhelp and be loved by people‚Äù, leading her to self sacrifice her body and soul to be used and abused by others, submissive, ‚Äúlady-like‚Äù, a good slave, child bearer.

Zeke tells her to be this good girl again, and end it. End her people, sacrifice again.

The constant abuse this ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù manifestation Ymir felt, led to the creation and eventual meeting with the ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù manifestation Eren, created to protect by attack and violence not self sacrifice. 

Eren then says she can stand up for herself, make her OWN decision. Which she then finally does. How unladylike. 

And that decision was basically violent deaths for the whole world. Very aggressively dominant.

King Fritz wanted to atone for all the atrocities the Eldian Empire committed, so he built the walls as a refuge where Eldians could live without hurting others. He wiped their memories to presumably stop them from wanting to leave or seek revenge.

lunchbag-mermaid,Flaming_Butterfly,"I think the animation for the underwater scenes didn't sell the realism of the swimming titans properly for a few reasons:

1) Scale

There's no point of reference to convey the scale of the titans when they're underwater. The scene right before the steam hits and the first titan silhouette swoops under the giant cruiser is excellent at communicating scale, and the only other notable example is when a titan zooms past the now stationary exploded limbs to communicate their speed. The other underwater scenes have no size or speed reference (i.e. schools of fish speeding across the foreground or a shark getting vaporised).


2) Effect on Environment

The volume and presence of the titans isn't properly highlighted by their effect on the environment. When the Beast titan is first introduced, he crouches down and the wind from his body blows through the trees shortly afterwards to emphasise the magnitude of his presence. It looks silly when the titans are shown swimming because they don't appear to be properly resisted by the water. Given their size, we expect to FEEL the deep *vwoom* *vwoom* as the displaced water from their kicks distorts the scene. We expect to see the missiles produce delayed shockwaves and gurgling bubbles of heat as they hit, and the titans should be bubbling with emitted steam.
Instead, the sound effects are shockingly faint, and the camera pans somewhat disjointedly over the swimming titans as they seem to glide with human-like weight and leave smooth, undistorted trails in the water.


This handful of scenes might be fixed with relative ease if the sounds of the bubbling and heavy swimming are magnified, some delayed water distortion is added to the titans/water trails, and some fish are sprinkled-on as blurs streaking across the foreground.",i3au806,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-04 04:02:45,21,3,i39cd2x,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

That's good because Erens plan is very extremist.

>Also, Historia made a good point about he's going to do to everyone what happened to his mom too... Eren's counterpoint made no sense to me...

Eren did need Historia. Specifically he needed her to not become a pawn of the MPs. The MP wanted to feed Zeke to her because they didn't trust Zeke. Eren didn't want that because he doesn't want any of his friends being forced to become titans and he especially doesn't want Historia to be sacrificed for the island. He went to speak to her to try to ensure that she wouldn't become a tool of the Maps since that could mess up his plan. Her becoming pregnant is what bought time for Eren Zeke and Yelena to set the stage for ""their"" plan.

>How did ""the scouts"" get a seat in that congressional hearing where Eren decided to leave and start his plan?

The Azumabito have connections and have been helping the scouts this whole time. Presumably they could get them into a conference like that if they were able to sneak them into Marley in the first place",i4a878x,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-11 14:05:48,4,2,i435b2w,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Eren can be seen accessing the power of the founding Titan for a second time, except he is no longer in contact with Dina Fritz. So unless mikasa is somehow of royal blood, because he was carrying her, then eren must be able to use the founding Titans ability under some circumstances without contact with a royal. It may just be a time duration thing. Like he might just have a limited window after touching a royal. 

Really strange, but interesting.

Edit: I suppose it would be a cool twist to find out Mikasa was a royal somehow. She does get a weird flashback to people with blonde hair in season 1 episode 6 (Timestamp 10:02).

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tkv_is_pro,"* These CLIFFHANGERS man;  
These episodes last like 5 min istg. These episode cliff hangers are a form of torture unto themselves
* So, time travel. I was roughly spoiled there was going to be an element of time travel, but that is the extent to which I was spoiled, which left me in the difficult position of not being able to really post in the manga thread (for fear of more spoilers) or the anime thread (for fear of spoiling accidentally); Glad to finally reach here and finally be able to discuss this.
* This is what I gathered from this episode on how Attack on Titan will tackle time-travel:
   * After this episode with all the 'future memories' stuff and Eren essentially influencing decisions that ALREADY happened, I am convinced this version of time travel is the 'fixed' version as seen in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.   
Essentially, 'past', 'present', and 'future' mean nothing, because everything has happened, is happening, and will happen.
   * As opposed to the other 2 types of time travel:  
The one with the 'butterfly effect', where going back in time to effect a change in the past leads to a change in the future (e.g., films like Back to the Future) or,  
The one with the multiverse, where going back to the past and making a change will create a divergent timeline (e.g., films like Avengers: Endgame or the 'Future Trunks' arc in Dragonball Z).
   * Basically, Eren's viewpoint of time is less of a stream, and more of like a flat piece of paper with all the information already on hand. His perception is similar to Doctor Manhattan in Watchmen.
* The most surprising (and terrifying) thing in this episode though is Grisha's reaction/pleading to Zeke (ZEKE! of all people, esp. since Zeke wants to euthanize every Eldian, a goal that is fundamentally against what Grisha stands for as a nationalist) to stop Eren's plan. Makes me really wonder how terrible/awful Eren's endgoal really is; and also holy hell I am so curious/excited to see what Eren's real endgoal is now.
* And one more for the road, THESE EPISODES GO BY SO QUICKLY.",huwgflh,sga0gi,attackontitan,2022-01-30 21:58:13,538,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

What a brutal scene nonetheless  


  
2. I guess Eren isn't omniscient with regard to the future.  
Much prefer it this way tbh; an overpowered protagonist is no fun.  
On a side note, he really is batshit crazy with his willpower, breaking his hands free of the chains like that.  


  
3. And there it is, the title card that illustrates just how meticulous the author of this story has planned everything out since DAY ONE.  A story almost a decade in the making (anime release time) (Season 1, EP1 (2013) title - ""To You, 2,000 Years From Now""; Season 4P2, EP5 (2022) title - ""From You, 2,000 Years Ago"")  
For the manga, I'd assume it's about the same length of time.  
Just insane levels of story boarding/ planning.  


  
4. (Wall) Maria, Rose, and Sina ‚Ä¶ oh my, there really is no wasted detail in this story

It‚Äôs been a crazy ride and this season has split the fan base so much with the extremists views and has gotten to how life is today.

I could not stand their mission when they had 300 of their men turned into titans and were alright with murdering Levi because he wanted revenge on the man who killed all the scouts.   

This world in my eyes was probably like 5-10 countries and were full alright with paradis being wiped out which is why Eren really had not many other options. He had 4 years left and only once chance to access the rumbling. Willy Tybur also convinced the whole world what eren was going to do prior to him attacking. What he did not count for is that the jaegerist were people carrying over the same hate that he wanted to end too and eldia would probably would split anyway and the cycle would still continue. I‚Äôm glad they showed those citizens from marley acting like devils because people have forgotten how awful Marley has been and what they created. Like they were flat out about to murder a kid because he stole a purse and his race. Eren saw there was no hope left and people will continue to lose their freedom because of their race and because of Marley.  

It was great to see the whole gang back together and something i have totally have missed the last 27 episodes.

Overall, another great episode. I like everyone's reaction to being in what to them seems like a whole new world and their party with the refugees. I especially loved the little hints that at this point in time, Eren's still dealing with what he saw and wrestling with the idea that it's fate.

I'm glad we finally saw Historia again and that but man oh man, Eren's expression while explain everything to Zeke and then us finally seeing him cut off his leg and gouge out his eye, was....*chef's kiss*. Also, did anyone else peep his face during the flashback to Sasha's death? I like how we see it's one of shock and horror, I didn't like how his laugh in the sub sounded genuine, dub did it better.

And the Rumbling, good god it's just as terrifying as I'd hoped. An unstoppable force and an unmovable object at the same time wielded by the most dangerous man in the world. Eren's Founding Titan up close looks great. At first, I didn't like it but now I kinda enjoy how it looks barely human.",i398sn9,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-03 21:01:04,314,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Glad we saw how everything started with Ymir, that poor girl, she didn't deserve any of that but the fact that she obeyed for so long is still strange to me. During her life she was essentially a Goddess of War but still chose to obey King Fritz? Also, cool that Isayama had hints of his future plans with naming the Walls after Ymir's daughters. Seeing Eren's Founding Titan and the beginning of the Rumbling was so worth it, we've waited so long

Now a few thoughts: Is there any significance to Eren's Founding Titan having the form really similar to a hallucigenia? Do Titan shifter's die after thirteen years because Ymir wanted it that way or because she died thirteen years after getting her power? How are regular Titans made if Ymir's power was passed on from generation to generation through cannibalism?

This leads to her truly feeling as if she doesn't have a will of her own or any sort of agency. She is merely a shell and a tool for the king. This continues even in death where she spent eons building titans as that was the king's wish.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daskrip,"My biggest question from over 8 years ago, **""why do the Titans exist?""**, has finally been answered. And the more I think about the answer, the more satisfied I get.

At first I considered that maybe they're just a part of the universe and a random element written in to cause lots of drama. But I slowly came to realize just how calculative Isayama is, and thought that maybe there really is an explanation for why Titans coexist with humans. But to give a satisfying origin story for something so intricately developed over so long seemed impossible. And yet, I LOVE how it got explained. 

A parasitic disease is just so fitting. Sure, there are a few logical leaps to take, but *way* fewer than I thought was possible. Parasites do change the biology of organisms, and they could spread to other organisms. 

Why 9 Titans? It's a biological limiter. Biology is a perfect way to restrict a function to a certain numerical limit, as we see this in real life all the time with animals' bodies, such as cats having no more than 10 nipples.

Why 13 years? That's how long the parasite lived in Ymir's body. It remembered that length of time, and programmed it into every subsequent host.

I'm even satisfied with why Subjects of Ymir were under the control of the royal family all these years. The parasite memorized Ymir's psychological state wherein she's subservient to the royal family, and so all subsequent hosts inherited the same trait. It's not completely realistic, but still, THIS IS SUCH A GREAT WAY TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. A parasite just makes sense.

So, what I am puzzled about is the whole 9 titan shifter thing. Ymir never split her powers, so did that happen by ""accident""? Basically her first three daughter inherited a third of her ability? And then their daughters/sons inherited more that it became 9 in the end? But if they still ate each other everytime someone died why did it stop at 9 and not split even further down every time? Especially since it works in the way, that if someone of those 9 dies, someone completely different inherits the power (I guess it's the next born then, but they don't have to be directly related to the one that died as far as I understood it). 

Furthermore, the original Eldian people were not able to transform into Titans, only the descendants of Ymir did. But all of them were supposed to always eat their dead family members. So why is there even a difference between royal family and non royal family? Everyone is a descendant of Ymir after all? And it's not like there was potential inbreeding to keep the blood pure. I mean, Ymir's daughters were already not pure-blood anymore and they were only daughters, so the next descendant would be even less pure of blood. Did the original Ymir family split at some point and one half just stopped eating each other so the ""royal family"" was the one that ""kept the tradition alive""? But I guess in the end, this wasn't necessary either as Zeke was just royal blood (and he was half and half as well, so it doesn't seem like there needs to be pure blood to begin with to be considered royal). So when did a split happen and what was that split?",hvv2ol6,slxcm6,attackontitan,2022-02-06 22:38:42,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ModieOfTheEast,"I guess there it is. I was expecting some kind of time travel twist. It wasn't so hard to figure out, but I hoped it would be done in a different way. Now we have a character that's basically the mastermind behind the whole story, the character who has been influencing the events of the story. And I personally don't understand why authors like to include a character like that (typically it's in Shounen where they have to make the final antagonist seem to be powerful, but here, I don't know why you would even go for it). It takes away from characters actions as they never had a choice to begin with (similar like with the Ackermann DNA twist). Yes, I get it's part of the ""freedom"" theme the anime goes for, but I don't think it was necessary. I mean, all that's left now is to show that Eren has been influencing Events even before that to really hammer home that there is this one character who has been behind everything. And I mean, they already did that to an extent with Kruger. I don't know.

We know that Eren cannot access the Coordinate except by touching Royals, and we've seen him do that three times: Dina's titan, Historia and Zeke. 

Further, Eren was able to communicate with Grisha only because Zeke was showing him Grisha's memories, which Zeke could do because he's a royal. Other than this one instance, I don't think we have seen Eren demonstrate the ability to ""send"" memories to past Attack Titans or even access their memories. He only knows Grisha's memories because of what Grisha wrote in his diary. 

The implication is that Eren hasn't really been pulling the strings all along. It's only after he kissed Historia's hand that he would have seen Grisha's memories and would have come to realize what was in store for the future. He couldn't have ""sent"" memories of the Wall being breached to Grisha, because Grisha was not in contact with a Royal until he confronted the Founding Titan, by which point, the Wall had already been breached",hva733r,sga0gi,attackontitan,2022-02-02 16:02:16,3,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DrPikachu-PhD,"Okay, so this episode left me with questions (manga readers, if I'm not yet meant to know don't tell me)

1) Why did Ymir return to being a slave after obtaining the power of the founding organism? Is it really as simple as ""It was all she ever knew""? Because she clearly hated being a slave and didn't love her king. Why did she continue to serve the will of the royals while in the paths?


2) Based on how the coordinate tree grew three branches when her children ate her remains, and then grew many more branches when they had kids and their kids had kids, it seems like you could surmise that all subjects of Ymir are descendants of her and the king's children. So if that's the case, shouldn't all subjects of Ymir be royal blood, and therefore be able to use the founding Titans power?


3) The impression I got based on the name of the episode and the line Eren says to Ymir is that Ymir essentially reached out to Eren for help, and the dream he had as a child in the first episode was him connecting with Ymir. If Ymir is seemingly a slave to the will of the royals, with no will of her own while she wanders around in the paths, how could she have reached out to Eren and called him to her?",hw1ll7d,slxcm6,attackontitan,2022-02-08 05:52:04,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

So what I can determine, the Attack Titan can pass down memories to those who came before.  To me, this would mean that originally, Grisha must have passed on the Attack Titan to Eren, who must have seen some terrible future, and thus influenced Grisha in the past to not only take the Attack Titan, but also take the Founding Titan, so that Eren would then inherit both.  That's the only way I can see them get out of the paradox of Eren needing to initially persuade Grisha in the first place.

So Eren may actually be the bad guy after all?  And if everything that's happened has been influenced and predetermined by Eren through passing down information through the years... then he must also have known about Zeke's whole ""vow loophole"" and passed that down and prepared for it.  I need some sort of recap episode that pieces together all the important bits and pieces from over the seasons to help me grasp everything that's been passed down and influenced.

If you think about it, what King would ever resign his throne to the children of the slaves he owns, even if they were powerful weapons. I believe that's the reason they couldn't erase their families memories and the other royals + the king's personal guard's memories. It's because what slave would ever have the power to do so.

Also, I think the rumbling isn't what we thought it was. It was never meant to defend them or to be used as a threat. It was meant for Ymir's revenge against the world, because if you think about it, not only has she been a slave for the amount of years numbers cannot express, but she's also seen all her people's suffering.

Plus I don't think we should call them eldians from now on. The eldians are just fucking degenerates who abused Ymir and the Subjects of Ymir. If you think about it, everyone has been doing so. The marlians, the royals in eldia and the whole world. There has't been a point in history where her people have been free, which is why the Rumbling is her revenge upon the whole world.

I don't even think Eren wants it to happen, but he saw Ymir's memories and all her Subjects' suffering, and both him and Ymir decided that's the only way.

I know better than to try and predict this show. But with Eren going wild and basically becoming the Bad Guy, there are three ways I can see this ending. 

1, the Scouts and etc turn on Eren and defeat him. They are sad but understand that, uh, murdering the entire world isn't a great idea. Most people on earth survive. 

2, Eren successfully kills everyone outside Paradis, making the people (who used to be ) within the walls the only humans that survived. might have to erase some memories while he's at it. Right back to square one except without titans probably

3. Eren wins but AT WHAT COST? Kills a bunch of Eldians and friends. Maybe everyone ever since I feel like a lot of Eldians would oppose his idea. And he Realizes he went too far. I'm thinking like Devilman levels of chaos and depression and world-ending

I like 1 and 3 best. I feel like 1 isn't very likely, though.

And what even counts as royal blood, since everyone is a descendant of King Fritz. Does it go by eldest daughter? If that's the case shouldn't most of the population have royal blood? This doesn't make much sense. How could you even tell who's royalty after 2000 years of reproduction.

Also what's the whole deal with Titans needing sunlight to regenerate. Why can Ymir only build Titans in sunlight. Does she require solar energy, is it related to the water bug thing.

What are the 9 Titans? Did Ymir's granddaughters eat her children resulting in more intelligent titans? If so why didn't they keep doing so. Would the process work only so many times before Ymir's powers were spread out too thin? Or did they just stop eating Titan Shifters' body for no reason. If three people ate Eren's body, would they all inherit each of his three titan powers?

Second generation (3): Maria, Rose, Sina (ymir x king fritz)

Third generation (at least 9)  (y/k+???)

Fourth+ generation: ???

You see, the third generation of titan wielders extermite other races and history, then force the victims to breed children for them. But problem is, they're not only descendents of ymir, but king fritz as well. There's 2 definition that i could think of, but i cant even convice myself

i) inbreeding: the titan wielders not only make children with prisoners of war, but also make children with other descendent of king fritz (by fritz's other wifes)

ii) ymir having children with other people: this is the most unlikely point. How can a slave like ymir get with other men? Plus, she's actually in love with fritz, i doubt that she'll cheat on fritz

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Jimmienoman,"My HUGE plot point was Zeke said he waited what felt like an eternity for Eren to be rebuilt. 

He then proceeded to want to walk Eren down memory lane.

In order for Zeke to know what memories to show Eren, would he have not had to walk through all of the history thus seeing how it played out prior to ‚Äúshowing Eren‚Äù?

So guess this could explained either by arrogance of Zeke (possible). 

or that the past was not changed yet as Eren had to be present to affect the past. This though would create issues with how AoT plays out timeline fixedness as Zeke would be viewing the past NOT viewing the past prior to Eren interfering.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sonofjupiteralt,"NO MANGA SPOILERS, Only Explanation  
So in order to avoid any confusion regarding the time travel mechanics, I will break down what type of Time travel we're dealing with here.  
  
AOT operates by a particular type of time travel where it's almost impossible to change the past even if you somehow go back in time. And any change that you tried to cause was always meant to happen in the overall timeline. Here time is a fixed circle, not a stream. We may see Eren meddle in the past but that was always meant to happen.  
  
The Attack Titan's ability is to receive the memories of its future inheritors. This was hinted when Kruger mentioned Mikasa and Armin towards the end of S3. Keep in mind, they can only view these memories but can't interact with them. So how was Eren able to meddle in the past?  
  
Well, he had 3 perfect conditions:  
  
‚Å†He had the ability of the Attack Titan  
  
‚Å†The ability of the Founding Titan  
  
‚Å†He was also in contact with someone with royal blood AKA Zeke.  
  
After Zeke tapped Eren's head, they were able to view Grisha's past memories with Eren using the power of the coordinate. They were freely able to view the past as if it were through a one way mirror.  
  
Now if Eren had any other Titan other than the Attack Titan, he would only be able to look. But since Attack Titan can see forward in time, Grisha can use this to see Eren's recollection of the same event that he's currently experiencing in real time.  
  
So this mean that whenever Grisha can see or hear Eren, he's actually recieving a brief future memory from Eren's POV where he can see out of his eyes and hear his words. That means he is seeing himself from a 3rd perspective. Then if he responds, his response is simply part of the memory that Eren/Zeke are viewing, allowing for a two way communication through time.  
  
Also Note that everytime, Grisha sees Zeke, Eren is always standing behind his dad. So whenever Grisha sees Zeke, it is from actually due to the memories from Eren's POV  
  
Another thing to add:  
  
Eren did NOT see everything in the future. Eren only saw CRUCIAL moments in the future, for example, he saw Pieck pointing a gun at him when he kissed Historia‚Äôs hand 4 years ago, this is why he was so calm when she threatened to shoot him, because Eren KNEW she wouldn‚Äôt shoot him. However, Eren DIDN‚ÄôT know that Porco was going to try to eat him just a couple of minutes later. Even Eren doesn‚Äôt know EVERYTHING that will happen",huxjeyg,sga0gi,attackontitan,2022-01-31 02:04:28,102,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Even the Owl got memories of Armin and Mikasa and immediately said out loud he had no clue why he was being given the memory but was just blindly passing it on to Grisha.

Past Eren had no power to select future memories to see. Future Eren selected every memory for past Eren to see as well as when he would see them - including when he saw the royal family massacre in season 3 after kissing Historia's hand. See his reaction. This is when Eren knew he was actually the one responsible for killing them

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jusaturt,"That was incredible. My brain still hasn't fully been able to grasp the implications of everything happening in this show, but this storytelling is really on another level in so many ways. I'm also high right now so this is gonna be rambly.

Where to start? My first time through the episode felt like being wacked over the head with so many plot revelations, moments of emotion, disgust and amazement that it was difficult to absorb. Immediately after it ended, I rewinded and watched the episode again. I'm about to rewatch it once more once I get some thoughts out.

There's so much complexity in this story, with so many different themes, narrative reframings, character motivations, and now time travel rules (which I'll touch more on later) that it's kind of mind-blowing how much.. plot, has been packed into these 80 episodes. But what's so fucking nuts about it all is that it's remained incredibly consistent. Attack on Titan has always felt like Attack on Titan, despite the fact that Attack on Titan feels like a thousand different things in one show. There's a scale and a depth to this thing that trump's anything else I've read, watched or played. The clashing ideologies are so interesting. The constant plot twists NEVER feel cheap, despite the fact that on paper it seems like they should. That's what impresses me most about this show.

I also am really growing to appreciate that Attack on Titan does not hold the hand of the viewer. It presents this story to you, and allows you to make sense of it all, in both the morals of its characters, and also it's internal logic (specifically the time travel rules and the powers of the titans.) My first time through the episode, I didn't realize that Grisha can't physically see Eren. I had to piece together for myself with a rewatch that when Eren kisses Historia's hand, he is seeing Grisha's memories of Future Eren, and that Grisha is seeing Eren's memories of watching him in the paths. Piecing that together for myself makes it feel so much more earned and rewarding than if the show had just outright explained it to me in an exposition dump. And even though I didn't quite get that on my first watch, it in no way hampered the experience. My disgust at Eren, Grisha's mental breakdown, Zeke and Grisha meeting again... It was a rollercoaster of emotions only made possible by careful buildup.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JakeXXII,"So I see a lot of confusion around the Attack Titan power and Eren ""changing"" the past. 

The Attack Titan allows its users to glimpse memories of future inheritors of the Titan. This allows them to see the future through the future host's pov. The Attack Titan power alone didn't allow Eren to ""change"" the past. It is because Eren also possesses the Founding Titan that he was able to do so. 

When he kissed Historia's hand, he made contact with royal blood allowing him to use the founder's powers and likely took him to the Coordinate where he could have spent as much time as he wanted studying the future. It showed Eren his father's pov of his memory of killing the royal family. Although they didn't show it in S3, Eren would have also seen future him reminding his father why he was there and urging him to kill them. (Except the father because the father needed to stay alive in order for the Historia plot to happen and allow Eren to kiss her and thus set this whole thing into motion) 

Present day Eren was only ""there"" because Zeke was using the founder's powers to visit their father's memories. Without the founder, the attack titan power does not allow physically revisiting past memories. Eren knew he'd end up there if he just followed the path however thanks to his Titans powers. 

Now for the trippy Inception like part. From Grisha's point of view, he is alone with the Greiss family in that secret hideout. At that point, as shown in the episode, he has already seen some of future Eren's memories. Normally, he'd experience these visions through Eren's eyes just like every other Titan shifter when they glimpse their Titan's memories. This is where the Attack Titan's power comes into play. Whenever Eren is physically present in one of Grisha's memories, it creates a feedback loop where Grisha is then able to see future Eren's memory of that very moment in his own memories through Eren's eyes. He doesn't see Eren standing beside him in the hideout or in any other memory, he sees himself through future Eren's eyes. 

He is able to see Zeke though because Eren is looking at him in the future and thus he is able to see him through that memory

People are saying that Eren has been playing everyone since the beginning but I dont think that's accurate. Up until the moment he made contact with historia, he was ""normal"" Eren and had no notion of the things he'd later do/has already done (Unless he also went to the Coordinate when he touched Titan Dina in S2 but they didn't show it). I think it is more accurate to say that Future Eren (post Historia kiss) has been the one orchestrating everything since the start, possibly even his own birth.

I also don't think it's fair to say that Eren brainwashed Grisha. We saw all throughout the memories, Grisha acting of his own accord without Eren's influence.

Things would have turned out differently without Eren's influence, but it's not like Eren is some time-lord architect who set up every event and controlled people against their will.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fearlix2,"Ok so I'm seeing a lot of confusion over this episode which is understandable for anime onlies. Manga readers had a month to make theories and analyze the story between each chapter which is roughly equal to every half episode.
So I'm going to try my best to explain stuff.
First off, something u should keep in mind is that not everything that comes out of the character's mouths is the truth. Case in point is grisha's explanation of the attack titan's power. He explained that the attack titan's ability allows it's inheritors to see the memories of future inheritors which is technically true but not the whole thing.
Let me explain. All the nine titans including the attack titan have the ability to see the memories of past inheritors ( porco seeing ymir's memories, Armin seeing bertholdt's etc) but only the attack titan has the ability to not only see memories from past inheritors but also send their own memories to past inheritors. So essentially what grisha said was true, he can see erens memories but he cant choose which ones to see because the memories he is seeing are being handpicked and sent back by eren and so by only sending specific memories back to his father he essentially manipulates and forces him to act as he wishes.
Something else to keep in Mind is that eren was actually unaware of the mechanics of this ability until right before the intro plays in the episode.
The first time we see the attack titan's power in action is when grisha notices future Zeke for the first time in the basement. If u pay attention in the episode grisha mentions Zeke's name before even seeing him just as he wakes up and he only does so when eren focuses on a picture of Zeke. So eren unconsciously sent back a memory of Zeke to his father when he noticed the picture and upon realizing how the power worked began essentially drip feeding grisha memories to guide him in the direction of the main timeline.
 It's a closed loop. Eren sends back memories, therefore grisha takes the founding and passes it to eren so 8 years later eren can use a combo of founding and attack powers to drip feed memories to his father and it all starts all over again.
And as for how eren knows the future despite not getting any info from inheritors after him, well it's ... Weird. Basically the idea is that if u see someone else's memory of something then that person's memory will become a part of your memories. When future eren sent his own memories to grisha they became part of grisha's memories which allowed grisha to become a sort of link between past and future eren. four years ago eren kissed historias hand and was able to see his father's memories and in his father's memories he found his own memories of the future. And that's how he knows his own future.
I think that about covers almost everything. Do ask if u need clarification on anything else.",hv9jr6c,sga0gi,attackontitan,2022-02-02 12:50:50,6,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheNewGuyGames,"It put a smile on my face to see the gang having fun with the refugees, and it was interesting to see Eren's actions once he set foot in Marley. To me, it seemed he had reservations about what he knew he was going to do. It also appeared that he was testing the future that he saw. ""perfect timing"", when the rest of the people found him talking to Mikasa I think implies that theory. As well as him attending the announcement for the Subjects of Ymir foundation, he wanted to believe that it would go a different way. When he saw that it wouldn't, he left and began the plan.  
  
Great to see Historia again. I imagined we'd see what's been going on in that neck of the woods, but I have been waiting for it. Interesting that Eren told her his plans. Could he have even changed her mind with the founding titan considering she has noble blood? If he couldn't, does that mean she's going along with his plan, or at least keeping quiet about it? I wont even get into whether or not he's the one that put a bun in the oven.  
  
I loved the conversation with Zeke. Eren actually had a true brotherly conversation. Eren truly could not fathom the idea that Mikasa may love him to such an extreme degree that he came up with the theory of an Ackerman protecting their ""host"". Cool to see the origin of that and further proves that he was trying to push her away so that she could go on without him.  
  
Okay, the last 5 minutes of the episode. Holy. SHIT. I don't know what's more gruesome, what Eren did to himself in the paths, or what he did to himself in the trenches. No matter his choices, that is some damn conviction right there. The swimming titans was sort of hilarious and equally terrifying. The Navy getting burnt from the steam was brutal and badass and awful all at the same time. Then the final shot of Eren behind the titan army, holy shit. I'd try to give myself the Reiner special if I saw that thing coming towards me.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheRealWipper,"(Anime only here) So it's what I've been thinking for a bit but this basically confirms it. Eren must have feelings for Mikasa as she does for him as well. Although he isn't sure she cares for him in any other way than family and after she gave that answer it was some kind of click in his brain that there's nothing left? But then we see him after with Zeke possibly trying to convince himself or find some reason that she doesn't care in a way he wants her too, but then says he ""only has 4 years left anyways."" Again just seems like he's trying to act like he doesn't care at all or something to that point. Then everything with Historia and the different points of view from everyone he talked with to set this plan into motion was spectacular. He was playing so many different sides and we got see throughly see his thought process finally. Such a sad and brutal episode that makes me feel horrible for Eren and everyone else. He's going through so much pain, and was even before they went across the ocean. He now thinks this is the only possible way to save everyone and save the people of Paradis. And you feel his anger when they rise from the ocean and it's a complete parallel to the start of AOT when the people in the walls were attacked and now they are facing that same horror while Eren feels that exact same rage he did when watching his mother get eaten.

2. What happened to Zeke? Hes shown as chained essentially in Ymir's ethereal plane, but did Eren eat him officially? Is he dead?
3. When will it explain where pure titans originated from? I'm assuming either at some point in the last 2,000 years someone had a bad idea to try and make new titans from a shifters blood and it being mindless/eats humans is a painful consequence to their arrogance, OR, the spinal fluid thing was already known and the only reason they are mindless/eat humans is because there isn't / wasn't a founding titan to verbally control them. Left unchecked by a founder, they default to mindless / human eating in hopes to find a shifter or the founder as an insurance policy the curse continues.",i6b91bs,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-26 22:21:34,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,robby8892,"I think narratively this was a horrible season finale as we gain no new information and are mostly left wanting.

The writers also commit to doing maybe the worst example of showing after telling I've ever seen put to tv.

And I truly believe episode 86 is the appropriate finale as it has a wonderful natural conclusion to the season.

Our characters are struggling and they are trying to build unity as a rag tag group that were initially enemies at the start of the season. 

Some are dead and there is an internal struggle to kill Eren to save the world. This was a true way to give us motivation for Part 3 as we already accepted that they are far to late to stop the initial destruction of the rumbling.

We ""killed"" Flock and got the goal set to refuel the air craft and catch up to Eren and his army of Olympic level titan swimmers. (I don't know anywhere that they established that Titans could breathe under water and I can admit I might need more context. It just looked silly) 

The stage is set.......

Point 1

Episode 87: Season Finale - Filler 

Episode 87 is 50% a filler episode in my eyes even if it gives a happy time with the gang it tonally doesn't fit with how we left everyone in the previous episode at such dire straits.

I get fan service, but the show needs to commit to this acceptance of the immoral genocider they created in Eren and stop trying to use characters like Armin and Mikasa to be his staunch defenders to pull him back or justify his cause.

It's not a cute fun loving show. Eren is going to commit global genocide to keep some of his friends alive which seems to make little sense.

Why would he think they wouldn't try to stop him? Flock was going to kill them all, would it not have been prudent to maybe say ""Keep my friends alive"" to Flock the trigger happy loose cannon....

Point 2

The writers want to have their cake and eat it.

The Episode commits to doing something I always known I would hate. They show us scenes of Eren doing things we were already told about in this season and the prior season.

So much so that it almost feels like a waste of time (Filler) as no new information is shared with us in the major plot. We already know Eren has committed to the path and we already know it's for the small reason to save his friends.

Now this would of been a perfect moment to address Sashas death....Seeing how the writers don't care to show us how he feels about her death I'll just assume it'll take up half an episode in Part 3 and not bother...

R.I.P. Sasha...

Point 3 

The writers aren't confident....

I'm 100% sure there is more lore and things to do from the Manga, but it doesn't seem to flowing as well as it could.

I very much feel confident in their decisions to make the character the protagonist they created a genocidal maniac as after a rewatch of the show up to now you can see how he slowly goes further into madness and blood lust over the years.

Truly a bold move and I wish it felt like writers were more confident in this choice. Because for most of the episode we try to play with idea that Eren could have always been like this.

A monster who is lost in his desire for revenge. No longer possible to reach his is a single minded killing machine....

Oh wait no in the previous scene it's so his friends can live happy lives. He has a good heart even though he will genocide the world.

Ultimately I feel like they can't decide what kind of monster Eren is. Is he the revenge machine pushed to the brink.

Or is he a person who would kill the world to save the people he loves. 

Guess we'll know which one fits next year!

Note:

This is very ranty and I respect any disagreement. 

If you wanna discuss I'd be happy to oblige, if you want to argue I'll probably ignore you.

I don't think the show is bad, but I find it's becoming frustrating when the writers can't commit to their decisions.

And I only wrote this because of how shitty I feel we ended the season as opposed to the last season.

Episode 86 is the true Finale. Fom a narrative perspective it's perfectly done.

Annie is broken, and we know the path forward is to save what little bit of humanity is left.

Yet she is done and wants to stop the fighting.

And what would be a perfect ending scene but having Eren making his first attack with the rumbling.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nervious_Nerve,"The pacing since The Rumbling started was off. I've only watched Attack On Titan on marathon format (I've never liked waiting a week for one episode; it always leaves a sour taste in my mouth). But i was too excited for this season as to wait, so I could be wrong. There's just been too much slow-show-don't-tell conversations with minimal action payoff. I'll have to watch Season 4 Part 2 completely again in one sitting as to validate my opinion on my complaint. ""The Dawn Of Humanity"" was a very poor episode. Even worse as a season finale. I even think it might have been better right after Eren Starts The Rumbling. You get a flashback, exposition about the last time they saw Eren. Then in episode 27, Mikasa on top of the ship heading towards Eren, Reminisces about what she could have said differently. Idk, this was too anticlimactic. The dramatic sequencing of three events: Historia (when was that conversation by the way? I'm genuinely confused), Floch, Zeke and cutting off his leg was emotionally charged, I liked it. It was a bit too on the nose for Eren but I liked it. I am happy though they're making part 3, I wasn't very interested in a movie seeing as it's just rushed content fitted into a 1hr 20 minute movie (anime movies are never long) attack on titan is better on longer run times and big payoffs. I hope the next season is better handled in terms of pacing issues. Seeing as part 2 was honestly the best attack on titan has ever been up to the rumbling. God the emotions behind those episodes is coma inducing. Followed by the slowest-rushed? Arc of the anime's entire lifespan. What the heck, i saw the first season when i was 13, I'm 21 now, i can wait another year.",i39ctbr,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-03 21:28:10,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

But something's really been bothering me as a plot hole, and that's the ability for one person to take on multiple Titan powers at once. If that's possible, then how come neither Annie, Berholdt, nor Reiner ever just chomped down on Eren and took the founder power that way? They repeatedly failed to capture him alive but each one of them had him in their mouth at some point so it makes no sense not to just take his power. 

It's also confusing that it had never happened before in history. If 500 years ago the armor titan ate the cart titan, then those two would always be together since the next person to eat that titan would get both, right?

On this same subject... What the hell happened to the Attack titan? It seems to be implied in this season that Grisha ate the founder and passed on both Attack and Founder to Eren, but in Eren's flashback his father was still alive and Eren just ate the Reiss girl, right? Maybe we'll see more about this in the future but it seems really weird that we don't know at all where the attack titan is or what it can do, especially since Grisha shouldn't be alive any more (assuming the 13 years thing is set in stone). Who has that power now?!?

Cheese_Boi_69,holloheaded,"it's not that time is slower there, it's that the realm of the coordinate is outside of time.  that's the whole reason the paths work like they do.  it's the same reason the attack titan can see future memories.  every instance of time is accessible at any moment via the coordinate, similar how you can pick out any frame in a movie or jump in wherever you want.  the difference being that instead of existing in a ""frames per second"" fashion, time has literally infinite divisions and can't be divided into basic instances because those instances could be infinitely divided and so on and so forth.  

the way the titan building works is ymir sees in one instance that a shifter is going to transform, so she builds their titan and then sends it to them through paths into that moment in time, but since that instance is basically just a ""frame"" (again ""frame"" is a generalization of the idea of an instance of time) of time it seems like an instant to the shifter who exists within the dimensions of time.

just to hypothesize on the nature of the realm of the coordinate a bit more there are a couple of ways that things can take place there without a flow of time.

one is that there is a localized, linear passage of time in the realm of the coordinate because if there were no passage at all then nothing could take place and everything would be frozen in one instance making movement impossible and preventing pretty much anything from existing there unless it was placed by an even more extradimensional being/force.

another way is that whatever exists in the realm of the coordinate \*appears\* to have a physical makeup but is actually composed of something that can function without the flow of time to allow it to persevere.  in my opinion this isn't the case in attack on titan because the titans are very much physical creations.  obviously there's room for infinite theoretical exceptions like the titans being just ""blueprints"" that are then manifested into a physical form once they arrive in the physical world but that applies to any theory.

my opinion is that this is the way it works in aot: in a fictional world like this one you can say that a person, place or thing exists in adherence to our universes laws of physics while still outside of time and just allow them to move through and affect their environment freely while while doing so.  in reality that is impossible, but fiction comes along with concessions and at a certain point no one cares.

in any of those cases however, ymir has been in the realm of the coordinate a finite amount of time.  an unimaginably long time, but a finite one.  however, depending upon how things play out she could very well end up there for eternity.",hvwqwq5,slxcm6,attackontitan,2022-02-07 06:20:05,27,3,hvuqv32,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

You can argue that it's simply best not to think about it.


Or, it you really are bothered by the grandfather paradox assume that going back in time changes the future. Events play out, someone effects the past (making it so that things play out differently), in that new future someone changes the past, and on an fon until you eventually get a past and future that match.

I think your explanation is 100% correct, but I don‚Äôt really like it.
‚Äî‚Äîif it‚Äôs ‚Äúfixed‚Äù as you say, then what‚Äôs the point of Eren sending memories back anyways if you know what I mean.

If it‚Äôs fixed, then sending memories back or not won‚Äôt effect the future. 

At the same time, I know what you mean. Sending memories back IS part of that future and the past, it has to happen because it already has happened. 

But like, just because Eren showed Grisha some memories‚Ä¶that doesn‚Äôt mean he HAS TO do anything. Like I don‚Äôt see what stopped Grisha from just not feeding himself to Eren after he saw what the future looked like. I actualy find it as somewhat of a plot hole that he DOES feed himself to Eren, especially after telling Zeke to stop Eren. 

Sure, he HAS TO, as otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt be watching what we are watching rn, and Eren would never have lived this long to even send memories. But idk, it seems like a gimmicky and non sensical time travel ordeal. 

The statement that none of these guys have ‚Äúfree will‚Äù is stupid IMO because there truly isn‚Äôt anything stopping them from defying the memories they see excluding the fact that they see the memories themselves.

That suggests that Eren has to somehow destroy the Powers of the Attack Titan, otherwise he would also be controlled by the next wielder of that power.

Likewise the power can only send memories to the past from the future (meaning the present time attack titan could fully choose what to do with those memories) UNLESS all three are present : founding titan, royal blood in paths.

I agree though, it isn't a deterministic universe, just one of heavy manipulation through time. Throughout the show, there have been examples of freedom being stolen, which Eren even referred to this episode. If someone is forced to do something such as via the Founding Titan, that isn't deterministic, it's manipulative or controlling. 
While AoT loves throwing curveballs at us, and twisting the plot into pretzels, the overall themes have remained consistent. With how much free will has been focused on in the show, and how fighting for freedom is worth any sacrifice, it doesn't seem consistent to suddenly have everything being set in stone from the beginning, and nothing ever matters.

if you're a casual that's in just for the ride I'd say you'll think it's an ok ending, not the best but it's still fine

If you're one of those people who spent hours going through discussions on every chapter, episode, character and story and analysing everything then

initiald-ejavu,Fabiocean,"Very well put. Apart from some assumptions I disagree with, this explains the ""hidden"" story of AoT very accurately. However, in laying these plot points bare, you exposed many things I and many others have problems with, even though you probably don't.

>The path Eren sees IS the one he will walk. He has no alternative. However, it is also exactly the path we WANTS to walk.

>Also, we know that the Founding Titan can cause tiny influences in different time periods now (such as distracting a titan away).

This is one of the biggest plotholes of 139 imo. Apparently, Eren has the ability to control any past titan (at least to a certain degree, he may have total control for all we know). I refuse to believe there was no other instance where he could have used this to get a better result than what he settled with. Bear in mind, there are endless possiblities he could explore, so a future where Sasha, Hange, his parents and many others die just for the sake of Mikasa's and Armin's survival (which wasn't even guaranteed either, by his own admission) seems far from the best option. If that really was the *only* way to save them (which wouldn't really make sense either given the infinite possible futures he can see), there should have been way more focus on that aspect.


>Eren pulled a lelouch in the ending. ""When the whole world hates me and you kill me, everyone will love each other!"" 

This is also such a stupid plan, since this would never work in this world, which also gets mentioned multiple times, and actually backfires massively in the extra pages, as you should expect. The outside world unconditionally hates Eldians, or are indifferent to them at best. After such an attack, no matter how it was circumvented, it's completely obvious that the survivors would one day retaliate. Also, if his plan was to get killed by the Alliance, why were they left in the dark about any of this? I know that it makes sense from a writing perspective, since the suspense and mystery about Eren's goals was a big part of the finale, but from an in-universe perspective, there's no reason not to let them know about this.

>she learns to get over her love of King Fritz (stockholm syndrome more like) and move on

That's another part I really hate about 139. Ymir really loved her abuser the whole time? It made sense when she was a powerless slave, it still kinda made sense after gaining titan powers, since she still was a mentally damaged child/young adult who didn't know better and probably didn't think she deserved better. However, after becoming  what basically is an omnipotent goddess with endless time to think about herself, it just seems weird that she didn't change her ways in those 2000 years. Even weirder is that somehow, Mikasa's half-baked love story made her realize the error in her ways, when nothing before could. 


>The cycle will start over again. It was completely pointless.

I'm honestly mostly indifferent to this, but I know that many people didn't line this. The futility of war and hatred gets showcased by this, even though the execution flopped hard imo, but the intent behind this wasn't that bad. The worst thing about this though, is that Eren lacked the foresight to predict any of this. *This is the path he chose*, so why does everything go to shit anyway? Some of these things were hard/impossible to predict, and since paths apparently was destroyed with Eren's death (also something we didn't get much needed closure on), he couldn't see any of it. But many things, most notably Paradis getting destroyed sooner or later and his friends potentially not surviving for long were so obviously going to happen with the outcome Eren chose, it just seems like he didn't even care what happened after his death, which contradicts everything Eren stands for.

All in all, I'm glad you laid the story open like this, so it's easier for you to see where I'm coming from. In the end, it's a matter of taste I guess.",hf5utwt,pzthco,attackontitan,2021-10-03 02:05:36,5,1,,initiald-ejavu,False
initiald-ejavu,HeNeedSomeSoyMilk,"This is a great analysis! Perfectly sums up how I interpreted the ending.

The way the panels switch between cabin-Eren and Rumbling-Eren as Mikasa kills him and kisses him goodbye was telling of the fact that they lived together in paths right around his final moments. Probably right when we see Mikasa get spirited away from the Rumbling to waking up at the cabin. 

I still believe he experienced visions beyond his death of him wrapping the scarf around Mikasa as a bird. This is why he REALLY wanted her to get rid of the scarf. He knew she was going to be there alone and grieving him years after his death still wearing it. 

But as he said, he doesnt truly know what she will do after he dies so I guess that was his last real experience chronologically with Mikasa and he never saw anything beyond that while alive with the Founder's powers.",hf42fm8,pzthco,attackontitan,2021-10-02 18:17:57,2,1,,initiald-ejavu,False

iamgoingtointernet,TyGuy223,"Dude, I'm so pumped because I totally saw this coming! Although, in my thoughts I thought they should've been doing the back stroke on the water's surface. Let me explain:

1. Titans are supposed to be less dense than humans. If humans float in water then titans definitely should, so it wouldn't make sense for them to walk along the bottom. Maybe they could give themselves some hardened titan shoes to hold them down, but that would be inefficient because of the following.
2. Wall titans have lanky arms and massive feet. Literally the best qualities of a swimmer. They should be able to swim way faster than they could ever walk.
3. Their intense heat means the water will likely instantly boil around them (as we saw) reducing friction and allowing them to swim that much faster.
4. I thought the back stroke could make the most sense if the titans were unable to submerge themselves because of their buoyancy, because then their napes would be more protected from shelling and bombs. Obviously this would be ridiculous, but it was a fun idea to throw around.

LightThatIgnitesAll,StealMyIdentity,"Hey! Thanks for clarifying some of this. Like I said, I don't intend for anything here to be taken as law, just offering some insights from someone at the very bottom of this process. I appreciate you expanding on Isayama and Araki's relationship in particular because I couldn't really find anything about this online.

I think you are misunderstanding some of my other points though. Starting from the bottom up:

* Yeah, of course. Criticism isn't in itself bad, harassment is.
* Of course it was popular from the start- and frankly it was popular most notably with people who had no experience with the manga. This being the problem in itself. Harassment of WIT employees continued until the very end of the anime, however, and the side-eye towards the anime was ongoing well into season 2. That's really what I'm talking about.
* Yep, that's true. I was really talking about the ramp-up pre-production period for WIT's take, not the independent schedule for each season. To further clarify, I'm not saying that Kodansha's specifications for the anime were new just for season 4. It just clearly become a problem that terminated in WIT dropping out.
* Like I said this is the part I wasn't sure of. I couldn't really find much information to substantiate this- not that I'm saying what you're saying isn't true. I was curious about where this was coming from however and still am.
* I think that probably a lot of what can be said how each part of the anime was perceived is probably relative to what circles you've hung around, so I will admit that my presentation of facts may be a bit skewed. Most of the reception I've been able to pull from is from Japanese fans, which honestly tends to be a bit different than US fans. What I'm referring to as ""peak ÈÄ≤ÊíÉ„ÅÆÂ∑®‰∫∫"" is the final few episodes of s3, which seemed to exhibit higher budget allocation. I would disagree it's the weakest season visually as well, but that is consistent with the timeline problem.
* This is very much an opinion thing. You're only looking at their big, successful anime when I'm talking about the bredth of their very limited field of work. But I can agree that they are *very* good at bringing emotional energy to their work. But MAPPA not being able to produce emotionally charged work? Absurd. *Kids on the Slope* is the quintessential music anime IMO. *Terror in Resonance* captures the fear and existential dread of terrorism amazingly. I don't really need to defend *Yuri!!! on Ice* as I know opinions are subjective there, but it was great. (except for the reused footage on the skating segments) *Inuyashiki* captures the frustration and dread of growing old as well as being imbued with power. *Banana Fish* is an extremely powerful portrayal of guilt, PTSD and the horrors of the world of crime. That's off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more examples.

Most importantly, my whole entire point *really* is not to pit these two studios against one another. I think both studios do great work and have occasional misses. It happens. I'm not going to go to the wall for either of them though.",hv5zmpj,shzamr,titanfolk,2022-02-01 19:34:52,3,2,hv5w7mv,StealMyIdentity,True

I'm totally soured on Isayama's ability to write an ending without feeling the pressure of expectations and whatnot, and this theory also continues to completely ignore Historia as she has no relevancy in most anything you mention, but I'd be somewhat accepting of this.

That said, you reference The Eternal Champion here, but the parallels between SnK and that series mostly centered around one Champion, Erek√∂se. With the 139 ending, Erek√∂se and Eren are no longer really similar, but before that there were many similarities between the two characters and their actions, specifically how they each chose to carry out omnicide in order to save a minority people using secret weapons the opponents had no hope of countering(in Erek√∂se's case his final decision was based on selfish love, for Eren if you didn't believe in EreHisu it was simply for his people.

The ending does not make sense because Ymir couldn't love, so no way she loved Fritz. Because Eren would not have rolled with his visions, and already had conflicting memories of Grisha with Frieda. Because there was no time, and no colossals, to rumble outside Marley, let alone 80% of the world. Because when they jumped off the plane, they don't want to kill him, but after stopping the colossals they go for the kill. Because Mikasa would have been killed within days of arriving at Paradis, let alone how she got there, let alone peacefully forming a family there. Because a peace embassy won't include traitors and mass murderers (Reiner and Annie),...

Does not make sense. But people believe it's real. Will defend it's real, while hating it. And that should give anybody pause. 

It's not a prank, but a lesson. 

About possible sequels...transmitting titanization means someone would have to become the origin of the paths. Trapped there again. And this ending goes for all clich√© moves and nihilistic hacks that writers with not enough talent use to ruin stories thinking they are elevating themselves. Isayama showed repeatedly that he's above them. As AU Armin says, it goes for the easy and obvious.

Remember the final panel Isayama leaked? The one in 139 is neither the panel, nor the baby, nor makes any sense Grisha would say that. He didn't change it, he showed it as a clue.

About other works in this world... I really would like the story about Karl Fritz. No way the set up in the present was a fluke, he was going for it.

emmyeggo,StNerevar76,"No, for a very simple reason.

You can have things ending badly and still making sense.

This ending doesn't, and is very deliberate in how it goes at it. Characters, themes, look 180¬∞ from where they should.

It's not things ended this bad, it's that there's no way they could have ended this way.

The timeline isn't fixed. Ch 63. Now about everybody that reads what I post is trying to headcanon it as art evolution, or Isayama not checking back when he drew ch 121. If I, or anybody, had realized it back then, we would have caught the trap the moment it was sprung on us, because Isayama had given us enough information to be able to do so.

But I don't think it's pararel universes, but kind of reloading an earlier save and trying something else with the accumulated knowledge of how things failed. Same plane of existance.

What I see in general is that despite realizing perfectly the ending is 100% wrong, hardly anybody can deny it, because it's the ending to the narrative since ch 121, and people got too captivated by Eren's, and the story's, nihilism. If they deny the ending, they deny the story.

Isayama is very much antinihilistic. That should have said it all.

If Gabi acknowledged Kaya's arguments against the marleyan propaganda at the barn, she denied the propaganda. 

Notice the similarity? This is a lesson, not a simple stunt.

Something that will subvert expectations but in a good way, AU Armin says, while his conversation with Mikasa points out how weak this ending is. My guess is that's for some time after the anime ends. No point changing anime, because if this targeted only manga readers, it'd wait too long for it. Vol 34 would have been a much better moment.

Read to the end to understand

Mikasa is a killing machine, the closest thing to the Terminator.

yes, she used non-lethal moves at the beginning, but you don't have to be an idiot ( I mean the characters ) to know that it would be short lived

I think killing the guys with the thunderspears and bathing in their blood was unnecessary ( in the context of the AOT world, because for the viewer it was AMAZINGLY GREAT ).

But I digressed a bit

The harbor battle was not Mikasa's fault, nor Connie's, nor the yeagerists, shit even Floch is innocent.

The great fault, of the great slaughter to humanity, are Eren and Historia.

Floch was used as a puppet by Eren to fulfill his part of the plan to provoke Mikasa.

Historia, she is an idiot, she was too cowardly to turn against Eren and let herself be coerced into having a child, she preferred to save herself than the world...which clearly sets her apart from Mikasa

Mikasa, Connie ,Samuel, Daz, that poor girl who almost killed Mikasa ( and Jean saved her again BTW ) were just soldiers in different positions, used as cannon fodder for Eren's mega plan and Historia's cowardly silence",i1vmnml,tlsodc,AttackOnRetards,2022-03-24 02:50:52,40,1,,Mysterious-Tutor-942,False

It's also hard to me to take seriously the complaints that are coming from fans that were pretty much already hating on Mikasa before she did any of this, or even hating Connie for shooting Samuel and Daz, sounds to me like they ignore the point.

I know you didn't say anything against this, but my problem with the ending isn't Eren not showing grisha a baby Ymir or something, that honestly doesn't seem as impactful to me, but my problem is Eren ending before 100%. I think the best story along the lines of AnR would be grisha's motivation would be exactly what you said, it just makes the most sense, and then the fact that Eren killed his mom to get Grisha to give him to titan, so that Eren could rumble the entire world to be free of the cycle of hatred constantly terrorizing him and threatening to take his freedom away. That stays consistent with the idea that Eren values freedom above all else. Above his friends. Above the world. Above his father. Above his mother. In light of all else, FREEDOM is the sole thing Eren will always prioritize, and what I wish would have happened would be Eren destroying LITERALLY EVERYTHING (the world, his father who loved him, his mother who loved him, his brother who loved him, his friends that love him) EVERYTHING so that he can have that freedom. That would be the perfect ending that I feel is retconned by Eren for some reason doing this so that his friends can look good or whatever.

For example, we know that there‚Äôs going to be some extra foreshadowing for Ymir‚Äôs ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with King Fritz according to Paolo. And for a while, I‚Äôve thought about how necessary it would be for the anime to smooth over the ending‚Äôs flaws with not ‚Äúfiller‚Äù but **completely new and original foreshadowing.** Do you think the reason for the slow (1x) pacing, even within action-based episodes, is only because there will be entirely original buildup for the ending?",hqw5t45,rtiq0w,titanfolk,2022-01-02 04:52:05,2,1,,berthototototo,False
berthototototo,JadeDotWu,"The filler and switches from the manga are intended to fix the issues. I don't think it's going to actually change the ending.


In my head the first episode will cover Mikasa's flashback after the Rumbling. It gets moved to the front to do a couple of things: reinforce the fact that Mikasa is important, remind the audience what's happening, and build to the battle. From there everything is played MOSTLY straight with a more additions- like Falco dream sequences when he becomes a Titan, and Zeke's Titanization Scream getting more of a focus.


The remaining 'filler' will be used to address plot-holes further down the line. There's gonna be more bullshit with the Alliance, like Annie and Levi talking. It's possible the Connie thing gets deleted or reworked altogether. If it stays in then we'll probably get extra short story sequences of other characters... like Historia. I think Connie also won't nab Falco until the Titan threat is MOSTLY finished. He's such an ass in the manga. The Titans are devouring people around him and he fuckin' BOOKS it with Falco. It's super out of character.


But mark my words I THINK there will be an entire Mikasa filler episode. Gods help us. It'll probably have something to do with ""I can sense where Eren is- like he's calling to me"", and some more explanation about the Azumabito, like tying that symbol Mikasa has to something about sacrifice or some bullshit Ymir/Fritz allegory.",hqvddol,rtiq0w,titanfolk,2022-01-02 01:18:21,1,1,,berthototototo,False

EDIT: now that I‚Äôm thinking about it, wouldn‚Äôt Eren be more like Loki? Loki is the one who starts Ragnarok with an army of giants, he does become a bird multiple times. I could be talking out of my ass but I‚Äôd love to hear thoughts. 

I can also see multiple references to Odin from Eren. Ymir was Odins father just like our Ymir is The Founder. There‚Äôs a lot of references to spears , Eren loses his eye briefly and gains ultimate knowledge. Plus the big ass tree. Odin sacrifices himself to himself at the world tree, so maybe Eren reborn is waiting in the tree.

TheCartTitan,favoredfire,"Well I'm personally bummed. I think separating 130 and 131 is a bad call. The two chapters play off each other so well and breaking Eren's flashbacks up feels not just jarring but gives a different feel to the audience, like 130 is far better understood in the context of 131 or idk if I'm explaining it well. 

Probably just my own bias to group those two together, because I can see MAPPA thinking ending part 2 with a hint of Eren's POV (130) and starting a movie/next part with it as well (131) is almost bookends, especially with the end (139 ) giving his POV again. It also ensures we get some Eren POV in both parts (or part 2 and the movie) rather than just to close off part 2 and then get nothing direct until the very end of whatever comes next.

I also really hope they don't do a movie now, fitting in 131-139 into one movie feels like too much imo.",hzef97o,t6w5qe,AttackOnRetards,2022-03-05 03:15:21,6,1,,TheCartTitan,False

EMJG30,Norim01,"Chapter 121 didn‚Äôt do it for me tbh.

I honestly think it was meant to be a red herring in the original ending; Eren made Zeke believe that he manipulated Grisha into killing the Reiss family, tricking Zeke (and Ymir Fritz) to think that everything was predestined. ''Eren set the story in motion'' isn‚Äôt such a good plot-twist anyway; It‚Äôs incredibly appealing, but a predetermined, causal time-loop (''You cannot change fate'') doesn‚Äôt make sense in regards to the story‚Äôs anti-nihilistic thematic backdrop.

If you compare the Cavern scene as it was depicted in 63 (https://imgur.com/a/0yKV2L1) with the one from 121 (https://imgur.com/a/DxM6maE), they‚Äôre different from one another in terms of Frieda‚Äôs behaviour as well as Grisha‚Äôs as well as the Reiss family‚Äôs. Also, Frieda notices Eren‚Äôs presence in Chapter 121: https://i.imgur.com/nnTMWBa.jpg

Furthermore, the scene from Chapter 1 is different from how it was depicted in Chapter 121, Grisha‚Äôs facial expressions went from neutral (https://i.imgur.com/C0IFixj.jpg ) to frightened (https://i.imgur.com/0GiWohq.jpg) and that shouldn‚Äôt happen if the story is predestined.

cpu9,Kustig,"Tbh as much as I want an AOE, the ending got just felt poorly written and ham-fisted together; which really leads me to believe you are correct.

But the one thing I don't see people bring up much in discussions is the fact that (assuming it were to happen) AOE would have to have been the original intended ending for the manga (otherwise it would have to be just another shoehorned ending like what we already got).  *If* it does turn out to a loop; Isayama would have to have intended that to happen within the manga.  Then when the anime succeeded would be when he considered changing the manga ending to further build up the original ending in the anime.

I really don't think Isayama was playing any 5-chess when the series started (he himself admitted that he rushed the beginning on account of not being confident in keeping the readers engaged).  But I also struggle to think that the same man who wrote RtS and the Paths arc would fail so much at the ending.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I don't think it's mutually exclusive that Isayama could be scared of writing Eren winning and him intending that to happen in an AOE.  Depending on how you see it, it could be his way of letting each reader choose the ending they prefer (and there by hope to avoid blame) or it could be the 'will to destroy' that he claims is reflected in the ending (and I like to think he didn't mean destroy his own legacy lmao).  And while the argument could be made that Kodansha wouldn't allow it; one could make the counter point that the manga ending first gives the pandering ending time make its sales, long before the anime flips a coin to either rejuvenate or demolish the series.

AOT is in a fixed timeline. Look up the ""Novikov self-consistency principle"" if you really want to. The past present and future have already happened so whatever actions Eren and Zeke do in the Paths will lead to the same state as they are in now.

As for the second part of your comment well 

1. Yes he was literally losing his mind already, add to that the fact that his wife was just eaten by a Titan.

2. How can you effectively explain to a 9 year old that his whole life is a lie and that he will have to commit atrocities in the future? Plus this would contradict his statement at Eren's birth ""You are free"". If he commanded his kid to do what he wants and how he wants it, he would make the same mistake as he did with Zeke but in this case Eren wasn't influenced by Grisha, he did it by himself.

I did find it suspicious though that Mikasa didnt call Carla ""Mom"" during her death like Eren did and Eren's breakdown got the main focus instead of both siblings getting equal focus about the loss of their mom but I waved it off as a protagonist thing.

I also see people call EM toxic because Eren headbutted her but my very honest first opinion on Mikasa was that she is a very rude bossy big sister who hurls him on the wall or floor whenever Eren does something she doesnt like and she doesnt keep the secrets he trusts her with so I actually disliked her. So I never understood the ""slave"" argument because my perception of her was quite the opposite.

Then her backstory was revealed and I understood exactly why she behaves this way, why she said ""that again"" when Carla died and the true nature of her relationship with Eren. After she blushed when Ian called Eren her boyfriend and Eren told her he is not her he is not her brother or kid, there was no reason for me to think of them as siblings.

they had a plan the 50 year plan but eren ran away when they were in marley so they been looking for him because they know without the founder Paradise don‚Äôt stand a chance at surviving

with the founder no one will be able to touch the Island it can control the rumbling and summon titans of the past so even aerial attacks will still be dealt with (flying titans ,war hammer titans)

and they have iceburst stone so with their partnership with hizuru they can upgrade their military power and let me remind you that they were the first to develop an airplane which other countries couldn‚Äôt 

so they had a plan they just wanted to look for alternative Solutions first but your Messiah was too busy playing pretending in a active war zone so he can have his dramatic reveal that easily could‚Äôve been avoided if he stayed in paradise and shipped zeke on a hizuru ship to paradise that‚Äôs it, if he can meet with kiyomi in secret like he did in 107 he can do that too

An added little note to consider, if we want to keep the parallels between their map and the real world going, is that many of our largest cities around the world are next to an ocean and, if Eren's goal is to ""destroy the outside world"", it would make sense to target those cities the same way he targeted the fleet.

No problem! :)

**Answer to note 1.**

I agree that Armin's conversation with the Jaeger bros were too undervelopped, it was just too easy for Armin to suddenly convince Zeke, someone whose philosophy revolves in regretting the fact they were born, that life matters.

Same thing could be said for Armin's conversation with Eren although I found this one in particular worse than Armin and Zeke's conversation.

For me another reason why I disliked the ending was the sentence ""I don't know... I just wanted to... at all cost."", which was Eren's answer as to why he started the Rumbling.

The answer neither proved that he was selfless answer: ""I wanted to protect Paradis/protect you guys and have live long live"" nor that he was selfish ""I wanted to start the Rumbling because I was disappointed with the fact humans lived outside the walls and so I wanted to wipe them all out just like it was described in your (Armin's) book"". And it wasn't some combination of the two, it was a simple yet blank unsatisfying answer: ""I don't know, I just wanted to at any cost.""

Well it's logical they'd be mad over the presence of that panel, it's easy to remove ONE page than it is to remove a LOT of pages to fix the pacing of the ending, and I agree with this take.

**Answer to note 7.**

Well if a girl tore her skirt in front of you, so she could bandage you, I find Reiner's reaction reasonable as Historia was the type of person people would fall over her, in season 1, both Jean and Armin call her an angel/godess. Especially considering that Reiner was 17 at the time.

However chapter 139's Reiner is different, not only was his scene another level of pervertedness, (it's like smelling a woman's underwear, although less creepy because it's a letter) but it's really unsettling and creepy, especially since Historia is married and because Reiner is an adult now, I believe he is 25 post Rumbling time skip.

My point is that both past and present Reiner's behaviour are on different levels of pervertedness and creepiness, with one fitting for a certain age range/version of Reiner and the other just isn't, soldifying what I said about misplaced humour, if anything ir was cringey and unsettling.",hw344pp,smrxo7,AttackOnRetards,2022-02-08 15:40:12,1,3,hw2zm8b,The_One_Nerd,False
The_One_Nerd,Far_Celebration_8827,"As an ending hater, I'm going to give my own reasons for disliking the ending, beware I'll be somewhat bias.

**Answer to note 1.**

Anytime Eren cried in the series, I personally never found it annoying, he was always true to his character/ideals and the reason why he cried were realistic.

He cried at his mom's and Haness's deaths, when he found out Bert and Reiner were the Armored and Colossal, when he found out his father killed the Reiss family and stole a power that wasn't his which made him realise he wasn't special, and my favourite of them all is when he cried to a random kid because his morals conflicted with his ideals, which made a complexe yet almost human character.

As someone who reads manhwas and romance webtoons from time to time, I can assure you that Eremika was the shallowest canon ship I've ever seen. Now I'm not a shipper, I don't care if Eremika or Erehisu make it to the finale, I started watching AOT for its amazing plot and world building, and not for its romance aspect as I only saw it as sub plots for why characters acted a certain way, like with Nicoolo and Shadis.

But Eremika never had any build ups, all it had are hints that Mikasa was an important figure to Eren, we see Eren blusing due to the sunset as he looks at Mikasa, ask her once ""What am I to you?"", there is the whole ""I'll wrap that scarf around you forever, as much as you want"" and the fact Mikasa's crystal shards are the biggest. But this doesn't contribute to the buildup of the ship, as I still see Eremika too one sided to consider it a proper relationship.

So when Eren broke down crying for Mikasa, not only did that feel as if it came out of nowhere but it also doesn't Eren broke down crying, if he was going to cry I'd expect him crying over the people he killed, about all the regrets he has, and the sins he had to burden, how he saved Ramzi once only to kill later. That's the Eren breakdown I want to see, not the one we got in the manga.

**Answer to notes 2 and 3 and 10.**

I also had no problem with the Alliance winning, I kinda expected it, I just didn't know how Isayama would deliver some sort of epic twist to turn the tides to the Alliance's side. That one guy vowed that Eldians won't be mistreated or viewed as devils, which tied into the idea that if a large threat was to appear, humanity will join together to fight it, which worked by the end.

My problem here is that instead of a twist that would help the Alliance, we got a Code Geass ending which I'm not a fan of.

It's true Paradis got bombed later, but judging by the size of the tree, the buildings, the aircraft, I'd say that this is set far into the future, so while the cycle of hatred will never stop, Eren's friends got to live happy lives.

Even if Eren were to 100% rumble all of earth, some day, Paradis will spread to the, what was once nations that were flattened, and once said lands gets conquered, new nations will form and will split into wars with each others, in other words we'd always be in war. (Basically what happens in real life, a big nation can get split multiple smaller nations that aren't on good terms)

**Answer to notes 4 and 5.**

Only Ymir knows.

It's at this point, I started to dislike the later chapters way before 139 was released, as I realised how flawed this arc is and how rushed it was by the end.

**Answer to note 6.**

Mikasa couldn't seperate from Eren and thus picked her scarf once more because of her resolve and love for Eren.

Ymir **loved** King Fritz, and couldn't let go of her love until seeing Mikasa who loved Eren, cut him down, thus almowing Ymir to move on.

I personally hate this twist of her loving Fritz, because you see, wanting to be loved by your abused is not the same as loving your abuser, and even watching the latest episode I can see that the ""Ymir wanting to be loved"" holds true, while ""Ymir loving King Fritz"" just doesn't.

**Answer to note 7.**

I don't see it as it destroying his character, but it did make him creepy and perverted, because the Reiner I knew didn't act this way back when he was 14 to 17 and was a cadet/scout.

Sometimes Isayama's comic relief just doesn't work, it falls flat, just look at Annie's pie scene, it wasn't the proper time or space to play jokes, and it didn't make sense for Connie to act like that at that point. Yes this is Connie, the one who makes jokes while RTS arc is happening, and even then I didn't laugh as I was confused and the joke went over my head, but season 4's Connie is different, just look at his breakdown in front of Onyankopon, he was mad, felt betrayed and tired.

**Answer to notes 8 and 9.**

I agree with this point.

Also I found Annie's special power to be useless? No that's not the right word. Probably... Underwelming in a way? Eren can also drink serums and get hardening powers and his powers have nothing to do with gaining extra special powers by drinking super bottles, unlike Annie's.

So what's so special about the Female Titan then?

**Answer to note 11.**

I think it's due to what we've seen from chapter 121, it somewhat showed that Eren will stop at nothing to obtain freedom even if that meant manipulating your own father to kill an entire family just to obtain a power that would grant you freedom.

Oh as for ""the most logical conclusion would've been Eren making the shifters unable to transform"", I'd like to say that Eren could've memory wiped the shifters, Hange and Gabi to make them stay in the island and npt attempt fighting him. Espcially due to him being aware of his friends's conversation when he had the Founding Titan.

**Answer to note 12.**

Halluchan's death doesn't bother me much, I just headcanon it as Eren's death made the parasite die on its own.

**Answer to note 13.**

I believe it's due to both the future memories and the soeech by 10 years old Eren. At least that's my headcanon.

**Answer to note 14.**

From my understanding, yes.",hvydx2m,smrxo7,AttackOnRetards,2022-02-07 16:33:35,6,1,,The_One_Nerd,False

Imo, 80% was never planned. He just knew the future and the time when he would be stopped. If you know the future and wants to follow it, everything is looked like a plan. Meantime, he felt enormous guilty and had no will to fight any more, like Reiner. It happened that he was stopped at 80%. If the alliance was slower he would be stopped at 90%, 95%, 99%.

> 3)I was appalled by the fact that Paradise was bombed and destroyed and thus all our people ultimately getting killed 

It depends on who are ""our people"" for you? Most of the Alliance members don't even live on the Paradise any more. In the end of 139 they were going back from other countries to the Paradise to the Eren's grave. In my headcanon Arimin-Annie children survived.

And, yes, it happened at least 80-90 years after the Rumbling. We don't know anything about the next conflict. 


> 4) If Eren had obtained the founder, why did he still need Zeke for the rumbling? 

Ymir needed him for some reason. She obtained free will after Eren's speech, but by the same free will she still wanted to be connected with royal blood and probably wanted to hear Armin-Zeke conversation. 


> 5) Wasn't Zeke trapped in the paths? Suddenly he got out to be killed?

He just didn't even try to escape until Armin encouraged him.


> 6) parallel with Ymir

so having the anime also make Eren say ""wait"" and putting that to rest was a moment where I was very happy

Jihadist_Chonker,Megashark101,"Yeah, I should have been more clear. When I said Uri, I meant to say the person that Uri became after King Fritz's mind or will or whatever got put inside him. When I referred to Uri having a selfish obsession, I really mean King Fritz. But since the only Uri we really get to know is the one who was already under the control of his weird mind fuckery, he shares his ideology. 

Essentially King Fritz (the one from 100 or so years ago) is a massive hypocrite. He claims that he wants to have his people live in peace and create a paradise for them, but in reality he just created the illusion of a paradise for himself. Sure, things in Stohess sure looked nice. He was surrounded by prosperous and happy people. But as soon as we start looking outside of Stohess, it becomes clear that this ""paradise"" He supposedly created is a bunch of bullshit. Just look at what happened to Erwin's dad, Armin's parents, most of the Ackerman clan, all before Reiner and Bertholdt ever rocked up to the walls. The Military Police literally exist to make anyone who questions the truth disappear. And again, Ackerman clan, hunted to near extinction, need I say more? Oh yeah, and when an epidemic sweeps Shiganshina District, something that we know he could stop, nothing is done. 

I should have been more clear, but that's what I was referring to.

Kromostone123,Megashark101,"Season 3 Episode 10 adapts Chapter 69 of the Manga, which is Isayama's favourite chapter. And you can really see why. While the Uprising Arc was heavily cut down in the anime, much to my (and other people's) displeasure, this episode lost hardly any of the original brilliance that it had in the manga.

Everyone's characters and motivations that are revealed in this episode just make sense with how they have been characterised. Like, you can tell why Kenny admires Uri and wants to be like him. You can understand why Uri spares Kenny's life and takes him under his wing. You get why the world of AOT is the way it is, because it is routed in the very human actions of these well defined and consistent characters.

And obviously, Kenny's final monologue contains probably some of the most important dialogue in the series. Usually I dislike it when villains get a ""sympathetic backstory"" dumped on us right before a villain dies, but here it makes sense because Kenny is reflecting after the events of previous episodes finally made him arrive at the truth. Obsession is one of the core themes of AOT, and Kenny all but confirms this in his dialogue. And it's subtle and earned enough that him essentially summing up the series doesn't feel cringeworthy or on-the-nose. After all, even at the end of the series, 70 chapters after this episode ends, people still don't get that. Characters like Eren, Uri, Reiner and Zeke will all try to justify their actions with noble motivations, but it all comes down to a deep rooted, selfish obsession.

Season 3 Episode 11 is the thematically imperative masterpiece that tricked everyone into just thinking it was some unimportant backstory for a cool side character.

Tl;Dr: Excellent characterisation of Uri and Kenny, and a beautifully subtle contemplation on one of the most overlooked themes of the story.",hjp8obv,qomped,AttackOnRetards,2021-11-07 19:02:17,10,1,,Kromostone123,False
