For one, Eren was not always sure of himself, he had a lot of doubts after he learned about the Reis family. In fact he was willing to sacrifice himself right away for his perceived greater good.

when he touched historia, he saw another section of the past, he earlier did not know.

eren thought, his father killed the whole reiss family, because kruger told him to get their titan.  
what eren did not know until he touched historias hand was, that erens father actually tried to convince the reiss family to give everyone back their memory, in order to prevent the death of his family ( he seemed really frustrated if u remember).  
but the reis family rejected his request.  
the conclusion: eren first thought the titans were to blame -> wrong, the martyr transformed all the tians ->  
eren then thought that the martyrs are to blame. ->  
well, he still thinks that probably, but now he also knows, that the reiss family is to blame as well, because they didnt even try to help preventing the death of erens family.

I think this was more explicit in the manga.

As for the number of Titans outside the walls, that depends on whether a bunch of people have been dumped on the island by Marley recently. The government inside the walls made it sound like the whole world was overrun by Titans, not whatever political prisoners were “sent to Paradise” in the last hundred years.

Them announcing another season is perfect for the anime, but people are now angry that they have to wait ? Like is this sub filled with 15 year olds year with no concept of how things work ?

When MAPPA started working on Season 4, back in 2019, Manga hadn't ended, they probably discussed with everyone and decided that Final season should be more than enough to wrap things up, and It changed as time went along, I am glad that along the way they elongated it even if it meant some kids would be whining about 'oMg tHe wAiT' instead of rushing it.

There is really no winning here, the toxicity here is so sad and pathetic.

Like, imagine if they had all original intentions to wrap everything in 2 cours. They decide to market it as the ""final season"" because that's what it will be. Doing multiple cours is not atypical.

But once they realized they had production issues, they opted to prioritize the quality and break things down to give animators more time and do more justice. However, it's two late to go back and change marketing that has already been released into the world.

Hindsight is 20-20. It probably seemed reasonable to them initially to wrap everything up in 2 cours. Would you have preferred them to rush it and give us substandard quality? I'd rather take some ""misleading"" marketing over rushed production resulting in shitty quality.

The primary point I'm trying to make here is that the misleading marketing mistake only needed to happen once in the past. They're not intentionally being manipulative every single time after that because it's too late to change your mind at that point.

Barjuden,SnooRobots281,"Ok so your views on it is full of misconceptions:

1) You can have that one

2) Eren didn’t leave 20% of the population to survive, the Mikasa killed him by he destroyed 80% of the population outside the walls.

3)It’s because Eren freed her by giving her the choice to give Eren the founding titan ability, Eren giving her a choice for the first time in her life is what incentivised her to do the rumbling… She also wanted Mikasa to inspire her by killing Eren.

4) Ymir saw a woman who was willing to protect a man at any cost because of her love for him and she couldn’t let go of him (Mikasa), that’s the parallel. Not whether there was love or not in their respective relationships but the need to always be their for their lover and to always fulfil their lovers wishes.

5) In chapter 139 we see a shot of Grisha giving Eren his name and Grisha says how Eren is free.

That clearly indicates to the reader if you have good reading comprehension and you knew what Eren was seeking the most that, his motivations was freedom.

So you’re incorrect there again.

Also with chapter 131, his motivations was that he wanted to make the outside world they way he envisioned it as a child not Eldia.

Your project is not happening, I mean you aren’t even paying them and you expect high level drawers to help you… you don’t even understand alot of the story lmao.",io5yu1s,vz9azv,attackontitan,2022-09-12 22:06:47,0,1,,Barjuden,False
Barjuden,SnooRobots281,"Edit: I want to add that I’m separating you and your opinions, I don’t hate you or even dislike you.

No, the plan was to destroy the rest of the world, it so happened that fate made it so that Mikasa in the future would have killed him ( you can’t change the future). 

In chapter 139 he explicitly states that he would have destroyed the rest of the world if the alliance hadn’t come for him. 

The choice Eren gave her wasn’t to end the titans or not, it was to give Eren the founding titan ability or not.

it’s easy to get the beginning part but more so alot of the end part.

The reason why she didn’t end it there was to allow Eren to use the power because he gave her a choice, for the first time in her life.

Also now you’re opposed to the Rumbling even happening but you prefer Aot no requim 🤣

Also again she need Mikasa to kill Eren, to inspire her.

Ok… 

That whole mini rant about Ymir and Mikasa in the middle makes no sense so moving on…

“But it’s more than that, the reality of life beyong the walls was nothing like the world I dreamed about… it was nothing like the world I'd seen in Armins book. When I learned that humanity had survived beyond the walls I was so dissapointed”

Quoted straight from the page… 

he didn’t do it for Eldia, but he did it because he wanted to make the outside world the way he envisioned as a child from Armins book.

He didn’t decide for Mikasa to kill him, it was fate that was completely out of Erens control. Have you ever heard of that concept. 

And again he would have destroyed 100% of the world if the alliance hadn’t come for him

Awnser this… Do you think that Eren would have stopped at 80% of the world if the Alliance agreed with him and stayed in Paradise?

Your misconception filled point… it’s really dumb tbh and shows your lack of understanding yes I exposed that for sure.

His plan is simple… destroy the world outside of Paradise.

I don’t think you’re objectively wrong for not like the ending but you literally think Eren planned to kill 80% of the world 🤣🤣🤣

Although, it seems like the situation in Eldia has some complexities since Eren said that basically none of them have free will.

How this “ladylike” ideal Ymir was juxtaposed with mega- masculine violent rage Eren in this episode. 

I see commentary on more broad ideals of masculinity and femininity (more in a yin/yang way than literal gender) through Ymir’s and Erens relationship/ connection. 

Ymir just wanted to “help and be loved by people”, leading her to self sacrifice her body and soul to be used and abused by others, submissive, “lady-like”, a good slave, child bearer.

Zeke tells her to be this good girl again, and end it. End her people, sacrifice again.

The constant abuse this “feminine” manifestation Ymir felt, led to the creation and eventual meeting with the “masculine” manifestation Eren, created to protect by attack and violence not self sacrifice. 

Eren then says she can stand up for herself, make her OWN decision. Which she then finally does. How unladylike. 

And that decision was basically violent deaths for the whole world. Very aggressively dominant.

King Fritz (from 100 years ago) made the walls and the bunch of Eldians moves there. He made those Eldians forget but everyone outside the walls remembered.

King Fritz wanted to atone for all the atrocities the Eldian Empire committed, so he built the walls as a refuge where Eldians could live without hurting others. He wiped their memories to presumably stop them from wanting to leave or seek revenge.

lunchbag-mermaid,Flaming_Butterfly,"I think the animation for the underwater scenes didn't sell the realism of the swimming titans properly for a few reasons:

1) Scale

There's no point of reference to convey the scale of the titans when they're underwater. The scene right before the steam hits and the first titan silhouette swoops under the giant cruiser is excellent at communicating scale, and the only other notable example is when a titan zooms past the now stationary exploded limbs to communicate their speed. The other underwater scenes have no size or speed reference (i.e. schools of fish speeding across the foreground or a shark getting vaporised).


2) Effect on Environment

The volume and presence of the titans isn't properly highlighted by their effect on the environment. When the Beast titan is first introduced, he crouches down and the wind from his body blows through the trees shortly afterwards to emphasise the magnitude of his presence. It looks silly when the titans are shown swimming because they don't appear to be properly resisted by the water. Given their size, we expect to FEEL the deep *vwoom* *vwoom* as the displaced water from their kicks distorts the scene. We expect to see the missiles produce delayed shockwaves and gurgling bubbles of heat as they hit, and the titans should be bubbling with emitted steam.
Instead, the sound effects are shockingly faint, and the camera pans somewhat disjointedly over the swimming titans as they seem to glide with human-like weight and leave smooth, undistorted trails in the water.


This handful of scenes might be fixed with relative ease if the sounds of the bubbling and heavy swimming are magnified, some delayed water distortion is added to the titans/water trails, and some fish are sprinkled-on as blurs streaking across the foreground.",i3au806,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-04 04:02:45,21,3,i39cd2x,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Appropriate_Type6153,SnooRobots281,"I agree… but with some slight alterations.

1) Dedicate a whole episode to Eren and Armins conversation and expand in the ideas presented (like you said).

2) Dedicate a whole episode to the final 8 pages, with dialogue and context added to what we shown.

Instead of just seeing things with no dialogue, that wouldn’t work especially as a send off for aot.

3) Like they did with chapter 123 & 130, some re-arrangements would be nice.

To somehow show Eren & Armins convo before Eren & Mikasas convo.

I also pray for 12 episodes too, Mappa has been slower when it comes to pacing and that was done for the better. Mappa improved the manga in the anime and I hope they continue it here.

This is a bit controversial:

But I would have Paradise attacking another country instead of Paradise being the one destroyed:

It shows the cycle restarting better than what we actually got… Eldians is the one who started the previous war and it’s Eldians who are gonna start the new war.

Instead of some random nation starting it…

Appropriate_Type6153,PhunkOperator,"> many people want to see an entirely original anime ending, however, I don’t think that’s necessary.

Speak for yourself. Liner x Eren x Connie threesome is very necessary in my eyes.

> Ymir loving fritz being thrown in at the end

This twist fell flat, for lack of a better description. Most people find the idea itself gross. Personally I find it ""unrealistic"", and no, the Stockholm Syndrome explanation doesn't satisfy me either, because that's not actually an accurate interpretation.

But Mappa already had the chance to build it up better in part 2, yet didn't. So if they don't do what you suggest in part 3, then this aspect of the story will probably remain as unsatisfying as it was.

> I also think that Eren and Armin’s conversation should be a whole episode that really takes it’s time and is a bit more thorough than the manga.

This is one possibility. The general problem is that everything about the ending was too rushed, and that Isayama was to cagey in regards to Eren's revelations. For example, considering all the other half-truths he tells Armin, how seriously should we take it when he says that Mikasa was the key to pacifying Ymir? I always thought that was just a massive lie on Eren's part, to hide his own insane intentions. He would've rumbled, Mikasa or no Mikasa. 

> that the pages about Mikasa’s future, and Paradis’s long term future should be expanded upon a bit more. 

Or thrown out entirely, to keep the ending open ended as it originally was. Or have a massive time skip and show just the tree and the kid. Mikasa bringing her entire family to the grave of a monster is just meh without more context.

But the idea of AOE is literally that it's the sequel to the manga, and the final ending that relies upon the manga ending to make sense. 

They stick to the idea that the entire thing revolves around the backlash towards 139 and that we want the anime ""changed"" as if to erase the existence of that chapter within the overall story. 

They mention that most anime industries like to stay faithful and respectful to the author. But they don't acknowledge the idea that the author may be behind the AOE and that to follow that path would be being respectful and faithful to the author.

Also they bring up that the few AO changes made so far are because Isayama wanted it, but somehow don't extend that logic to an AOE.

For a short section they acknowledge the idea that Isayama is ""in on it"" but dismiss it because of the production issues WIT faced, and the fact that they were only signed up to do one season. But it couldn't have been known how successful the anime would have been back then so it would've been unrealistic to make such long term plans. In the case where the anime wasn't a success, the type of narrative AOE theories follow could've just stayed within the manga.

It's not a matter of MAPPA ""throwing out"" the final volume if Isayama and the AoT committee were to have been committed to an AOE before planning for the finale began. And it's not about ""making a fan theory come true"", it's about making what would've been Isayama's vision come true.

They make the assumption that MAPPA has already planned out 139, which it doesn't seem there's any evidence towards. MAPPA wouldn't have to re-do anything.",k2pa02o,16uy38k,AttackOnRetards,2023-09-29 11:48:24,-8,1,,No-Past-4379,False

This one. It holds such an important meaning to her arc. It’s when her arc has finally reached its end and by saying that being a goddess wasn’t so bad, she finally comes to accept who she is as an inherently selfless person (hence the callback to the idea of a ""goddess"" which was used by her to refer to Historia as someone who is ""trying to do good deeds"" but as we know Hisu was faking being an altruistic person and was actually the selfish one while Ymir was the selfless one faking being selfish). She had convinced herself that she wasn’t being true to herself by being selfless because of what happened with the cult, she initially thought it was a position that was placed onto her without her really getting to choose and she blamed her self sacrificing nature for going through this traumatic event, but really it’s by acting selfish that she was being untrue to herself because no matter how hard she tried not to be selfless, she would always help others.",lb3uktv,1ds8y0g,attackontitan,2024-07-01 12:20:06,4,1,,Life_Is_A_Mistry,False

MisplacedxLightbulb,commander_wong,"My complaints kind of extends just beyond the ending itself, but the also leadup to it

A) Eren not regress his character and being ""an idiot"". Like I get what Isayama was going with, but I just don't like it. Ultimately a character with clear goals and motivations is more captivating than characters that don't know what they're doing

B) The Ymir thing. I thought the Ymir characterization was ok. It was kind of clear that she was like that when she protected Fritz from the spear. I thought her regrets on not letting him die and imaginary hugging her daughters was nice, touching even.

What I didn't like was how this was the key to stopping all Titans out of nowhere and for some reason Mikasa was the key to everything despite having very little similarities to Ymir's situation. There was just no setup, didn't make much sense and wasn't a satisfying answer

C) Time paradoxes. As cool as the ""sending visions to the past"" has been in some moments, it ultimately added nothing to the story as a whole. I felt it made a lot of character motivations convoluted when it didn't need to be, and made characters feel like they have no agency over their own actions. Like Grisha making Eren a Titan after begging Zeke to stop him, or Eren sending Dina to eat his mom

D) Alliance motivations. From our POV, it's easy to say ""genocide is wrong"". But from the characters in question, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Outside of Jean and maybe Armin, the rest of Eren's friends aren't exactly altruistic people. I feel Isayama never developed a good reason for why they would go out of their way to stop Eren

E) Characterization changes. On that note, I feel a lot of characters have been made to support stopping the Rumbling when they probably wouldn't. Most of the dead Scouts probably wouldn't mind the Rumbling happening, Erwin included. Kruger especially shouldn't be against the Rumbling. 

I feel Isayama also made the outside world a lot more tolerable as the Rumbling is happening and did the inverse with Paradis citizens, which I felt is doing too much to make the readers/watchers feel bad about what Eren is doing

F) Plot armor. Kind of a minor complaint, but the Alliance members' plot armor in the final battle is just off the charts. Comparing the beginning of the series to what they are doing now feels like two different universes

G) Historia. She did nothing post timeskip. Her parallels to Ymir wasn't important. Her pregnancy, which was brought up quite a bit, didn't really lead anywhere. 

H) Armin x Annie. Also kind of minor, but this is maybe the worst romance I've ever read. Some defenders of this ship will pretend this was ""foreshadowed"" when Annie didn't kill Armin as the Female Titan, which is probably the lowest bar for a romance I've ever heard",k8kaig1,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-09 23:09:51,121,1,,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

He wants freedom for Paradis and his friends, he wants to wipe the rest of the world away, he doesn't want to but he's a slave to the future and the founder, he doesn't know why, he's an idiot... its a bit confusing. Yes some of these overlap and multiple can be true, but I'd simplify it personally. I'd carry over his titan hatred of ""the enemy"" to the outside world and have him refuse to see them as people at first (basically even more of an inverse Gabi). Then as he spends time with more of them (Yelena, Onyonkapon, Zeke, Falco etc) his ability to view them as inhuman enemies gets more difficult which is why he becomes so cold and distant. He basically separates himself from his humanity to avoid thinking about how immoral the rumbling is and how many innocent lives he's taking. Basically have him explain to Armin that he spent so long consumed with the idea of ""killing all of his enemies"", titan and human, that he couldn't let himself come to terms with the shifting morality of his mission. ""If I can just finish the mission I promised to complete years ago the people I care about will be free"".


Also this might be unpopular, but I'd remove the twist of him leading the Dina titan to eat his mother.

If they wanted to do an arc where Erens the villain thats cool but it felt wrong to have that be the end.

If were keeping the premise of the rumbling for the end, I A. Definitely think one of who became the alliance should have been one of the Yeagerists (Cause lets be honest- Flochs an interesting character but we don't care about him like Reiner or Jean) and B. REALLY think ONE, AT LEAST ONE of the alliance members should have died. Jean I think would actually be the best chcouce for both; He has a choice to make- Either join the Yeagerists and live peacefully, or fight with he alliance and risk death. I think if he picks the latter, he should pay the price.

commander_wong,New-Monarchy,"Hijacking the top comment here to add a couple more quick things. I completely agree with you! But I just wanted to add some points that aren’t limited to the finale, but are all still technically towards the “end” of the story:

1. I straight up dislike the “Pride” episode (4x24). I thought that episode was a good opportunity to flesh out both Annie and Connie, and it kinda dropped the ball for both because it needed to rush through so much so fast. It would've worked 1000x better if it was split into two episodes. One for finding and fleshing out Annie/Connie, and one for forming the alliance. I think it’s probably the lowest low for the entire series for me.

2. I would extend the plot armor complaint to the Jeagerist fight by the port too. Not AS bad as the finale fight, but still a little unbelievable given what we’ve seen in battles before.

3. Pacing. Once the actual rumbling starts, the story’s pacing is just too quick. I understand that Isayama was under a lot of pressure to finish up the manga, but there were just so many things that needed more time to flesh out. It started off as nitpicks here and there, but by the time the finale comes, I have legitimate issues with just how QUICKLY some of the plot threads are resolved, on top of the issues listed above and by the comment I’m responding to.",k8kfwv6,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-09 23:44:12,33,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False
commander_wong,random1211312,"I agree with most of this. However I think A was just a bit too subtle in what it was about. Eren's always been a childish and irrational character. That's part of what made his ""switch"" to the stoic badass bitch so shocking. But in reality the act falling apart at the end makes sense. That being said, I do think it would've been better if they hinted at that a bit more and structured it in a more logical way.

I also disagree on C a bit. Again, it could've been handled better, but I do think it adds to things more. My only complaint is that a lot of the actions taken weren't left with enough of a question for it to be anything but ""Woah that's crazy"". For example Grisha killing the Reice family. It's very easy to say he did it for his own reasons. But they added in the Eren bit, which while shocking, and chilling for what Eren's willing to do as well as Zeke's development, added nothing to that moment itself. In fact it would've been more terrifying to see Eren redirecting the smiling titan to his mom instead.

Everything else I either completely agree with or what I disagree with is so minor it's not worth noting",k8lgk5u,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-10 03:55:50,16,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

K. The Rumbling should not have ended when Zeke died(Btw Zeke's anticlimactic death is a whole can of BS after a Talk no Jutsu from Armin) We have seen earlier in S2 ending that Eren controlled Pure Titans even after that initial touch from Dina.

I was so disappointed. I wanted to destroy it all"" and in special 2 (Chapter 139). ""If you guys hadn't stopped me, I would've flattened the world"" or something to that effect.

commander_wong,zbox2345,"Definitely some valid complaints here that I totally get.  I’m sorry for the long reply, and writing isn’t the easiest way to convey my thoughts, but if you care to read this, here you are. 

A) I can see where you’re coming from, but I disagree that Eren was a character without clear goals and motivations. The thing is that he has multiple motivations, some of which inhibit the other goals. This is not uncommon in the real world either. His four mains goals as I see them were 1) Get rid of the Titan curse.   2) See that scenery (create the unoccupied world that he saw in Armin’s book).   3) Protect his friends, and yes, I’m aware Hange and Sasha died as a result of his actions (this is where his other goals inhibit each other) plus, I think that as he saw it, this was the clearest path towards safety, as it was the future he saw in his memories. Fighting a war against the world was too uncertain for his taste. 4) Buy Paradis a reasonable amount of time. Finally, when Eren calls himself an idiot, much like the rest of the dialogue in the series, people take it at face value without applying context or trying to parse his words. I don’t think he’s saying that he’s stupid. He’s saying he’s an idiot in the sense that he couldn’t let go of his childish desire to see the world he wanted to see in Armin’s book. 

B) I don’t feel like there always needs to be an absurd amount of setup for every plot reveal. Sometimes, a plot reveal is meant to take you off guard a bit, but when you think about it, it fits well enough. Others have written good pieces on this https://x.com/cactuzz4nf/status/1721331822158618670?s=46&t=FinmjoOw7kwnyVV30b6joA

C) Frankly, I agree with you here to some degree, especially regarding Eren’s mother twist. As for Grisha, I’ve seen people theorize that Eren showed him other memories later that convinced him to give Eren the Attack Titan. During the conversation with Zeke, it’s clear he didn’t know Carla had died. It’s possible knowledge of her death is what triggered a rage in him that made him give up the Titan to Eren. Ultimately, there are times where a writer chooses to allow some ambiguities that can reasonably be filled in by a viewer for the sake of story pace. That is not the case with Eren’s mom, which is why I dislike it a bit. 


D) I fundamentally disagree here. I think this is one of the most well developed and predictable outcomes of the series. To talk about this, I have to begin with the Jaegirists.  Although I disagree with them, I understand where they’re coming from. To them, the world is a faceless monster that wishes them dead, so why shouldn’t they respond in kind? In contrast, our scouts have crossed the sea, lived with the people across the sea, and have become aware that the outside world is not so different than theirs. Most of the outside world is innocent. As Hange said, they’re no longer ignorant island devils. They can’t just sit back and let Eren trample over people without discrimination. It would be impossible for them to enjoy the “peace”, however brief that “peace” may be, knowing that it was built upon the lives of BILLIONS OF INNOCENTS. They’ve been victims and witnesses of indiscriminate murder, at the hands of pure titans, since the very first season. How can they idly watch as it happens on a planetary scale? I think this is why Onyankapon was so frustrated by the Jaegerists at his execution. He was frustrated that none of them could understand the insanity of indiscriminate murder, despite their own experiences with it since the fall of Shiganshina. 

In the end, it all circles back to dialogue from both Armin and Levi from the first season. When the female Titan is attacking, Levi tells Eren “You can never know for sure what the right choice is in the moment; you have to make the choice you believe you’ll regret the least.” Every character in the alliance, as well as Floch himself are doing just that. 

Armin’s speech about who people perceive as a “good person” applies more to us as an audience. A lot of people can become blinded by emotion or personal investment for one side or the other, which narrows their perspective. So many support the Jaegerists without even trying to understand where the Alliance is coming from. Same goes for blind supporters of the alliance who dismiss every action the Jaegerists take. I think this lack of perspective can hamper someone’s experience. If you’re ridiculously biased toward either side, you may find yourself loving or hating the show for the wrong reasons. To me it’s a harrowing story, where every character involved has been put in an impossible situation where the stakes have never been higher. My own views fall in line with Alliance, so I root for them, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t understand Floch and company. 

E) Again, I think you are misunderstanding the characters. I understand that Erwin is capable of making hard decisions, but that doesn’t mean he’s without any moral fiber at all. His entire goal was to prove that humanity existed outside the walls. Do you honestly believe he’d be down for INDISCRIMINATE global genocide? I honestly don’t think it’s that crazy to think that he would oppose it. As for Kruger, how is him opposing the rumbling unbelievable? He’s from Liberio, which is in the path of it. 

F) Off the chart plot armor seems a little extreme. Can you give some examples? Obviously, their skills improved significantly since season 1, so yes, what they’re doing now will be more impressive. 


G) Parallels can be set up between multiple characters. It doesn’t always have to directly lead somewhere. The point of her pregnancy was plot related. She had to become pregnant to avoid being fed Zeke. Plus, her baby is the first born into a world without titans.

H) This one seems more like a personal gripe. I thought there was sufficient setup. Romantic setup can be subtle; it doesn’t have to be overt. Armin and Annie’s ties have been evident since season one, at least to me.",k8m1kmc,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-10 06:52:46,2,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

commander_wong,Opposite-Constant329,"I respect a lot of these critiques. I hope that I can clear up why I think the Alliances motivations do have good justification. 

One of the biggest things is that everyone in the Alliance besides Levi and Hange spent that night with Ramsi’s family. This group understands better than anyone else in Paradis that there are plenty of people in the world that are either being oppressed by Marley as well, or have nothing to do with the conflict. These guys have bonded with “the enemy” more the anyone else. Especially given the fact that they grew up as soldiers with Reiner, Bert and Annie. One of the big themes of AOT is that it’s easy to assign evil intentions or kill people who you’ve never even tried to sit down and talk to. All of Eren’s friends have experienced dining with the outside world and know that there are people that inarguably don’t deserve to be killed just for living outside the walls. 

I’m not sure if you think that Levi’s motivations are unclear but I feel if anyone lacks justification for helping paradis carry out a genocide it’s Levi Ackerman. Levi grew up oppressed by Paradisians. Not only was he essentially confined to an underground ghetto, but Paradis had actively been carrying out their own genocide that people tend to forget. The Ackerman were systematically being hunted down sponsored by the royal family as they were uncontrollable due to their immunity to the founder. Then Levi is essentially forcibly drafted into their military, and when he eventually turns it into his family, he is regularly spat at by the average paradis citizen when the scouts returned from failed missions. Then after all of this Floch the leader of the Yeagerists attempts to execute him while he was mortally wounded trying to carry out his final mission in killing Zeke. 

I think in all Levi understands that the world government wants him dead because he is from Paradis, and now confirmed extra by Floch’s betray, he has been wanted dead by the Eldian’s for his immunity to be controlled by the founder. Helping one of these powers commit genocide does nothing for him.",k8yraib,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-12 20:22:00,1,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

commander_wong,KittiesOnAcid,"I like the ending thematically, but I agree it's poorly told mostly because of F. The battle on Eren's back against all those powerful titans definitely feels like a completey different world compared to the threat of even a few normal titans in earlier seasons. Suspension of disbelief goes out the window. The pacing is also awful and ramps up way too quick. I kinda think we would've benefitted from knowing more about what's going on with Eren.

Ultimately, idek what to think. The show couldn't always stay the same as it was in Seasons 1-3, and I like the idea of Paradis and Marley. I like where the story goes, Eren's disillusionment with the real world, the reveal of the titans' true origin and the discrimination against Eldians, etc. I like the themes of the end for the most part. But the plot goes way too quickly to Eren being a genocidal maniac, the rest of the cast fighting against completely unbelievable odds, and Mikasa and Armin feeling so good about Eren at the end is a bit weird. It's nice that Armin shoulders a bit of the responsibility but also feels unrealistic to how someone would actually act there. And obviously Armin teaching Eren about the outside world does not even begin to justify Eren's viewpoint. 

It's weird, a bit all over the place, and feels like a different world from the rest of the story. At the same time, I cannot think of any way to do it better other than making it longer to fix pacing and flesh some stuff out.",k986vn9,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-14 17:08:50,1,2,k8kaig1,MisplacedxLightbulb,False
New-Monarchy,M1x1ma,"I agree with you on the plot armor. I was frustrated in seasons 3 and 4 when the main characters held back on killing people and they got away over and over again. 

I also thought the decisions at the end weren't in their nature, like in seasons 1 and 2 they were pretty open with eachother and would talk everything through beforehand. In the last season Eren leaves them and is making all these rash decisions, the Islanders want to do the rumbling and defend Eren to do so, and then think it's too far and stop him. Everyone is blaming Erin for Sasha's death even though it was totally unconnected to him in a mission they all signed up for.

KookyAssociate3825,DaRandomRhino,"But that still ignores that the early parts of the series before the timeskip and certainly up to the sea was centered around far more standard tropes that aren't determinism.

The broken gear, Mikasa nearly dying while Eren was full berserk and right before he showed up, etc.

Once determinism is thrown into the mix as late as it was, it hamstrings plot and motivations so much. It's no longer Eren seeing his mother killed, it's a determined event. Once he gets future memories he no longer makes choices, he hits the play button. Him going to Marley in secret to see how they live and treat Eldians doesn't matter, because he was already on autopilot from the moment he touched Historian's hand and that had already happened to him potentially.

The Paths are a great idea, his Titan sending memories backwards neat, his motivation being to see his people and his family free to the exclusion of everything else in his mind, neat. Every single bit of it comes tumbling down as soon as they are introduced together and makes the buildup to it largely meaningless. 

You could start the series near the end and have an actual deterministic story play out convincingly. But the start and end are written with completely different motivations from Isayama. 

It may be because the timeskips just sorta happen. The titans suddenly no longer being a threat in any way, shape, or form to force the threat be Marley, the rest of the world, then ending with Eren in almost no time at all for the audience and their perception of in-universe time being inconsistent.",k8yasvt,17rne38,attackontitan,2023-11-12 18:41:36,2,3,k8xon4s,MisplacedxLightbulb,False

No she got pregnant to help his plan after he brought up her line about being the worst girl in the world (from the cave scene at the end of season 3 part 1).

> Eren's counterpoint made no sense to me...

That's good because Erens plan is very extremist.

>Also, Historia made a good point about he's going to do to everyone what happened to his mom too... Eren's counterpoint made no sense to me...

Eren did need Historia. Specifically he needed her to not become a pawn of the MPs. The MP wanted to feed Zeke to her because they didn't trust Zeke. Eren didn't want that because he doesn't want any of his friends being forced to become titans and he especially doesn't want Historia to be sacrificed for the island. He went to speak to her to try to ensure that she wouldn't become a tool of the Maps since that could mess up his plan. Her becoming pregnant is what bought time for Eren Zeke and Yelena to set the stage for ""their"" plan.

>How did ""the scouts"" get a seat in that congressional hearing where Eren decided to leave and start his plan?

If Eren can’t affect the story being a powerless omnipresent being, then he has no more agency post founder, no matter if he has wants/desires because they are irrelevant to the the future decisions of the story with this take.

Also Eren not controlling titans can be explained like that yes but that’s very vague and ends up being a plothole to just end it as that if it’s even mentioned in the first place if I’m honest, I think with this line it’s more of the story making you question why Eren is not using his powers.",l8cr2xn,1dek573,AttackOnRetards,2024-06-13 02:27:04,1,2,l8cqcea,MiloDoes,True
Kuirage,redeclipse619,"What I mean by mystery is that the pregnancy plot intentionally gives vague explanations and raises questions such as who was conspiring with Historia and why she got pregnant which is left unanswered until 130 which is quite frankly not enough to validate Historias actions character wise considering the severity of the rumbling. If instead of leaving these questions unanswered at the end of the story, Isayama undoubtedly could have explored Historias character and psyche, and how she coped with Erens plan which would provide opportunities to better elaborate on Historias state of mind.

Historia as a character is unconditionally benevolent and kind hearted, and always looked out for others. That was her goal, it was what she took pride in. It’s shown over and over again that Historia is considerate and empathetic and this would apply to the outside world as well. She even says herself in chapter 65 that she’d help anyone no matter who and no matter where, and unlike characters such as Floch and Eren,
Historia shows no animosity towards the outside world, and even points out to Eren that the majority of the rumblings victims wouldn’t deserve it, so it’d be a stretch to say that she was only considering the island and not humanity in general. 

Out of all the characters Historia should be among the least likely to support the rumbling because of her kind hearted personality, and she says that’d she would never be able to forgive herself if she supported it. And although it’s true that there was no right answer for her. Both options go against her beliefs, and it’s because of this that she should attempt to carve her own path to try to avoid both options since both options go against everything she stands for. But this never happens. She never tries to find another solution to the problem like the scouts did, she instead chose to immediately comply with Eren despite the severity of the rumbling. It’s not like she tried her best to avoid helping Eren but she only followed through because she had no other choice since she immediately chose to comply with Eren as soon as he revealed his plan, and never attempted to find a different path to help Paradis. Saying that she carved out her own agenda as well isn’t entirely true since she was obeying at worst and allowing/remaining neutral to Erens plans at best despite how much it goes against her beliefs. She didn’t try to find her own path to help Paradis, she followed Erens path.

My opinion though, it felt a little unsatisfying. I wanted to like Eren still and the ending turned him into an unlikeable whiny child. Or rather,  he was always that unlikeable why child and he never changed from birth. All very poetic, good writing. Great use of a default protagonist that should be a dynamic character that goes through growth,  and it seems like Eren grows and changes, but only due to perspective. Once the ending unmasks him we see Eren as the static character he always was. Good writing. 

But still I wanted to root for Eren. I still do. And I find the idea that genocide could be rationalized to be a more compelling idea than just ""never an excuse for war or genocide, Eren bad"".

If ever there is a good excuse for genocide/the rumbling its in a universe where magic exists and the population with that magic will be persecuted and hunted for all time.

Idk I get that I'm wrong. But it just felt like it would have been cooler for Eren to make a compelling philosophical case for his actions rather than just be revealed as a selfish child with a huge gun.",mtd0cer,1krbja6,attackontitan,2025-05-20 22:47:22,2,1,,fear_no_man25,False

Eren isn’t allow himself to be defeated. He wanted to complete the rumbling to 100% but was stopped by the alliance because he was unwilling to take away his friends freedom and power. And taking away their memories in the paths isn’t the same as taking away their freedom, because the message was meant for be viewed after his death. It’s like a loved one recording a video message in the present which is meant to be viewed later in the future

Karl Fritz was a coward, he didn’t want to fight, he didn’t want to do anything, all he wanted to do was live out the rest of his life in a peaceful paradise he created. And getting rid of the Titan powers isn’t as simple as just commanding Ymir to do so. Ymir must be freed for the paths and Titan powers to disappear. Which is why she was only freed by Mikasa at the end of the story. Eren also didn’t erase Ackermans memories, he spoke to them in the present time with their last conversation, as the founders power can’t affect Ackermans

The wall titans aren’t the same as normal pure titans, which is why when Zeke dies they don’t move aimlessly. These titans must be controlled by the founder and Ymir in order for them to move. So Eren dying wouldn’t make the turns act any different to Zekes death, as they would still need the founding titan and Ymir to control them, which they wouldn’t have

You’re overthinking the paths. The paths are used for the sole creation of Titans. The paths were created by Ymir’s will and the Worms power, being the Titan power, therefore would make sense that the only thing that would be transferred to the real world is Titans


I’m not reading all that about the great titans aren’t because it’s literally just a massive block of text, like the rest of your post 🤦‍♂️

kagantamello,Raznuk_Venger42699,"Bad take incoming... First season is so boring at the beginning, worst season of the series (not necessarily bad, but not that good), Eren turns into a giant way too soon, controls his titan form to quick, and it only gets some proper pace in the last 5 episodes.

Second season is the best one by far, incredible outcomes and such outstanding plot twists, (no, Bertholdt and Reiner were spoiled to me but they were no obvios of being titans, it was still a surprise to me), specially with Levi vs Beast Titan, gorgeous fight. .

Third season part 1 is compelling very well executed, Kenny's backstory and the Founding Titan source, specially both Historia's and Eren's development were pretty great, even though it's not as good as the second one (Historia's father turning into a Giant giant titan was kinda lame ngl), still better than the first one.

Then, Third season part 2 which is an absolute masterpiece, second best season in AOT's anime, Eren vs Reiner was so anticipated for me, the way they defeated Bertholdt with that final outcome delivered by Eren since First season was an amazing final touch, or trying to decide between Armin or Erwin was breathtaking, and that cliffhanger is such a banger with Eren's dad reveal about Paradis and Marley, I fucking love it...

And then we have Fourth season, great plot twists, heartbreaking moments, yeah, but Warhammer Titan was such a disappointment, it didn't even last more than one episode, and lost its relevance that it gained a few moments ago, I mean, even the new animation gave me mixed feelings, and never got used to it, splitting it too many times in too many parts was exhausting, at lest the story was keeping us up for the vast majority, but it went downhill with Eren knowing all the past, being able to change his past, alter his own life, but doing absolutely nothing thinking he could not change anything when he could (maybe not but at least try it), then got me again when the formed an alliance against Eren, him being the final villain is a nice touch, but it all was planned by a stupid grown ass kid who did not wanted to Rey and fight against the past, let everybody else getting killed by the titans (how the hell there's a bunch of Colossal Titans when only one exists? How does that even make any sense?), Hange's sacrifice was sad but didn't have any real purpose than getting rid of her, and I wanted more of her dammit, and the final solution was for Mikasa to deliver the final kill and beheading Eren because she was the answer, only God knows which is that, and that's it? I mean, like that? C'mon, the outcome could've been better than that, and still I kinda like it, I simply requiere more context and justification for that final showdown, it doesn't make any sense but I think I understand where Isayama was coming from... And that well executed disappointing endless war that destroyed humanity over and over again... And I'm fine with that, it makes sense with how they've been acting with each other, but at the same time makes Eren's self sacrifice completely in vain and shallow, it served for nothing, leaving it as an open ending that goes to nowhere, and I get it, thematically it works and sounds great, but the execution man, it sucks...

goltaku555,Traditional_Buy_8420,"I think I dropped AoT at S3E20. At the very least I watched S3E11. Had the Anime ended after S2 I still wouldn't put it into my top 10 Animes.

Mostly the pacing was too slow. I remember some action scenes revolving around Levi Ackerman which I liked a lot and he also had the best dialogue, but I'm still not a particularly big fan of him. Overall I didn't like the dialogue in AoT. I tried jap, eng and ger dub and nothing particularly clicked for me. I remember when I first saw a trailer I found the art style interesting, in hindsight I can't tell whether the parts of AoT which I found boring (I can't point any out in particular because they weren't memorable, also it's roughly 3 years ago since I dropped AoT) dulled the art style or to me the style didn't fit the setting, storytelling and pacing in the first place. I think part of it was the mood, like everything is doomed all the time. It's not even like I hate mourning or realistic moods in general, for example in Grimgar the mourning of a lost teammate was done really well and they reacted accordingly. I think it's more that they made proper plans accordingly, so one thing which sullies AoT for me is that so much is so hidden, that it's hard to tell in which direction the plot is going, so then it's harder for me to get invested to it. For example I liked the plans they hedged when when they started suspecting sth. inside the walls and obviously there were going to be twists ahead with that arc and there were and I liked it till there, but then after most of the twists were revealed again sth. seemed to drag along and make the pace slower than it needs to be, one thing is characters who hesitate to do what they must, but there's something else which I can't put my finger onto.

While I didn't drop Grimgar, I wouldn't say it's better than AoT per se. There's other Animes which I liked a lot less than the hype they brought with them, for example One Piece or NGE. Some of the Animes which I enjoyed a lot are Death Note, Kill La Kill, Re:Zero, Stein's Gate, Your Name.",mmvy1f9,1jy59gd,attackontitan,2025-04-13 14:43:07,-7,2,mmvpugc,kagantamello,False

PhantomSteals,VariedJourney,"I don't use hianime, but generally  the order beyond the OADs is meant to be straightforward. But if hianime is being weird about it, here's perhaps why: Attack on Titan's last season was released in parts, and the final chapter is likely referring to the last two episodes (referred to as specials) of the show.

The way the final chapter of AoT was released was as a special of two episodes, known as the final chapter or 'specials'. They are referred to as specials sometimes because the two episodes are both hour-long episodes and are the final part to season 4. They are also sometimes referred to as part 3, from what I can tell.

For some reason it seems they're offering you multiple.. options for watching the last part/specials of the season? ..I still wouldn't worry, because either way you're gonna end up watching in order - just be safe and watch part 2, then part 3, and then 'final chapters'. They may have separated the seasons out more than they usually are, but certainly the final chapters are referring to what the final episodes/specials are called.

It definitely shouldn't be complicated - if you're able to watch AoT somewhere else it might make things easier, 'cause most places just keep it simple. 'Season 4, episode \[blahblah\]' throughout.

The black and white pictures are fun, sometimes references to other things, a couple have stories, but you could probably look at those online another time - they're not mandatory.

By the time the gang meets Reiner and Annie again, the scouts had launched a terroist attack on Liberio and killed thousands of innocents.

I didn't mind this at all. It was honestly worth it for Reiner to see Jean and Connie attack him and Reiner yelled ""When will our torment end?!"" Like that was a powerful moment for me personally, mostly for Reiner.

>she is still very clearly in love with Eren past his death

Yes and *despite* this she still chose to *kill* him. Which is what Ymir could not do. And the significance of that choice is reinforced by the vision of Ymir clutching her 3 daughters instead of saving Fritz from the spear.

Zeke was already dead, so Eren presumably didn't have the ability to control anyone anymore (which is why he had to plant memories in them earlier, before Zeke died).

I’m in further disbelief that some people genuinely defend it. There’s *nothing.* Its a black hole of an ending.

* Aaron then proceeds to destroy everything and then goes back in time to do it all again just to see them suffer. 😈

\-along his fed-up journey he tells all of his friends what's gonna happen just to wipe there memory. Even though some of them have the same hate boner.

\-aaron attempts to save his friends from the Paradis people (even though the plan is the dumbest and most non logical thing ever like I mean EVERY).

\-but Aaron knowing that there's ""no way"" to be with Mikasa (even though literally he has the founding Titan) makes her simp for him so much that she makes out with a decapitated Aaron. YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT SHE MAKES OUT WITH A CORPSE. and then this is the funny part. He makes her stay single just because he's a creep.

* Aaron's ""plan"" some how works and they (some how) live ""happily"" ever after.
* but wait they still need to deal with some important stuff like AARON'S DEATH CULT and mind you that AARON TOKE ALL OF THERE TITAN POWERS SO THERE JUST REGULAR ASS HUMANS. AND ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW AND WHY AARON JUST DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE TITAN POWERS FROM THAT HORNY WOMAN. NO FU DEAL WITH IT.

It would have been interesting to see that instead of Yelena turning the tables on Pixis, it's Rico who surprises him by having the guards guarding their room turn their guns on him and take him prisoner.

With Lobov leaving the Garrison, that would leave a vaccum in the structure of the branch and having Rico fill that spot by gaining a promotion to further cement herself as a spy for the Yeagerists would serve as a real punch in the gut for pixis and Hange when the eventual reveal comes around.

He died pretty early on, and even though he was their friend, we barely knew anything about him. So when the characters were acting completely devastated over his death, I struggled to understand because I never really felt that strong of a connection to him. The same goes for when Eren was so shocked to learn that Annie was the Female Titan,I mean, she was always distant and cold toward him. Out of everyone, she should have been the most obvious suspect, though ironically, I never suspected her at all.

But back to Marco. He died in an environment where, as painful as it is, death is common. Of course, his friends would have been sad, but they would have eventually moved on and thatrs exactly what they seemed to do in the first three seasons. Then suddenly, in season 4, Marco is brought up again, and we are told that his death deeply affected Jean. But for three whole seasons, Jean seemed more concerned about the people dying right in front of him, and he never even mentioned Marco.

Also, something that always bothered me, how did Yelena even know about Marco? Was she close to Reiner and Bertholdt, and they told her? Probably not Bertholdt, since seasons 1 to 3 take place over just a few months, so I doubt they had even met her back then. So why was she, of all people, the one to bring him up?

And then there Is Jean‘s reaction. He is so devastated about Marco that he brutally beats Reiner, yet he is suddenly indifferent toward Annie? That never made much sense to me.

Overall, I think Jean’s moment of regression was too short and too easily resolved. If he changed his mind that quickly, was it ever really that difficult of a choice for him in the first place? I feel like his hesitation should have been established much earlier, maybe at the start of the revolt, so we could see that this internal conflict had been brewing for a while. That way, when he struggles with it later on, it would feel more natural, like yeah, this has always been a part of him. But maybe I am just overthinking it.

I also just really wanted him to become the leader he was set up to be in some way. In the end, Armin became commander, and Levi was the one actually directing everyone. I liked Jean a lot, so it feels like something was missing. But maybe I was just expecting too much? I didn’t even think about all these things before the ending, maybe I just took Attack on Titan for granted.",maxynrc,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-04 17:18:19,0,2,max1zrq,Shani_Jeizan,True

> Eren could control all titans from the start but that doesn't really make any logical sense to me. 

Another option is that there's something special about Dina that makes him able to control her. And there is: She's a titan of royal blood, and touched him while he had the founding titan. After attaining full FT powers and starting the rumbling, Eren could have gone back in his own memories to the day that he touched Dina, then from there enter Dina's titan memories of the day Wall Maria fell and controlled her from within that memory.

Stoner420Eren,A-Delonix-Regia,"I saw the last chapter unfortunately, but anyways, this is not a theory, just what I'd want in the ending:

1. Eren fails to kill everyone before he himself gets killed
2. All of Eren's friends hate him for what he has done, but they understand why he did it (they kinda just avoid talking positively or negatively about him)
3. Eldia somehow manages to make peace with the remainder of the world sometime after the Rumbling, and this peace is shown to last till the AoT universe progresses to modern technology (what happens after that is left open for interpretation) (as you can see, I am a bit of an idealist with this sort of stuff, though I am aware that world peace for 100 years would be unrealistic)

Given that the entire fan theory is made out of whole cloth, it wouldn't be too difficult to move the goal posts. AoE discourse should mostly disappear as there won't be a new audience to appeal to. Every new fan to the series post the finale will watch the entire show before ever being exposed to AoE theories and won't be anywhere near as invested. Old fans will move on and these communities will shrink but I doubt they will ever go away entirely.

What I really want to see is what happens to Titanfolk once the ending is faithfully adapted and it's well received by the Anime Onlies. Even better, what if the adaptation properly contextualizes everything without changing the story. The foundation of much of the criticisms depend on misinterpretations of crucial dialogue to deliberately misrepresent the story.

HarisNd88,Payment-Hour,"I started reading the manga some month ago and also it was my first one. At first, it was a bit weird, I think I have missed details in panels because of my “lack of experience” lol. But apart from that, I learned that it depends on 1. On your personal preferences (for example, I pay a lot of attention to the OST and some people don’t care about them) 2. In the type of chapters you are reading. 

I prefer reading heavy dialog chapters because in anime I can’t take my time to process information. Then, action chapters are great for seeing them animated. For example, I wasn’t expecting that much from the assault chapter and it ended to be my fav in this season. However, I was too excited about the declaration of war and it was a bit overwhelming. Apart from that, I enjoy watching the anime version despite knowing what is going to happen ( I think I have more hype than before). The bad thing is when the manga puts your expectations too high and the anime can’t reach them.

To test number 1. I recommend you to read for example Return to Shiganshina arc (an arc with plot twists and heavy action-packed) or another one and compare this experience to what you saw in the anime. It’s not gonna be the same because now you know what happened, but you can make an idea of what reading a manga is and how much do you like it. 

Apart from that, if you decide to read the manga, don’t make the same mistake as I did: don’t read the whole manga in a few hours. Take your time. Because you will reach a point where you will be lost.",gqyphgo,m588t0,attackontitan,2021-03-15 01:37:02,4,1,,HarisNd88,False

I understand now why Zeke betrayed his parents and his plan of Euthanising Eldians. Although I don’t think Eren shares the same intentions.

The true nature of the Attack Titan! So Future Eren influenced Grisha to steal the Founding Titan! What a plot twist, it was Eren all along, even when Kruger mentioned saving Mikasa and Armin!

There’s some small details in this episode about the coordinate that was shown visually. I think Ymir is the trunk and the branches are her children.

Eren can be seen accessing the power of the founding Titan for a second time, except he is no longer in contact with Dina Fritz. So unless mikasa is somehow of royal blood, because he was carrying her, then eren must be able to use the founding Titans ability under some circumstances without contact with a royal. It may just be a time duration thing. Like he might just have a limited window after touching a royal. 

Really strange, but interesting.

Edit: I suppose it would be a cool twist to find out Mikasa was a royal somehow. She does get a weird flashback to people with blonde hair in season 1 episode 6 (Timestamp 10:02).

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tkv_is_pro,"* These CLIFFHANGERS man;  
These episodes last like 5 min istg. These episode cliff hangers are a form of torture unto themselves
* So, time travel. I was roughly spoiled there was going to be an element of time travel, but that is the extent to which I was spoiled, which left me in the difficult position of not being able to really post in the manga thread (for fear of more spoilers) or the anime thread (for fear of spoiling accidentally); Glad to finally reach here and finally be able to discuss this.
* This is what I gathered from this episode on how Attack on Titan will tackle time-travel:
   * After this episode with all the 'future memories' stuff and Eren essentially influencing decisions that ALREADY happened, I am convinced this version of time travel is the 'fixed' version as seen in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.   
Essentially, 'past', 'present', and 'future' mean nothing, because everything has happened, is happening, and will happen.
   * As opposed to the other 2 types of time travel:  
The one with the 'butterfly effect', where going back in time to effect a change in the past leads to a change in the future (e.g., films like Back to the Future) or,  
The one with the multiverse, where going back to the past and making a change will create a divergent timeline (e.g., films like Avengers: Endgame or the 'Future Trunks' arc in Dragonball Z).
   * Basically, Eren's viewpoint of time is less of a stream, and more of like a flat piece of paper with all the information already on hand. His perception is similar to Doctor Manhattan in Watchmen.
* The most surprising (and terrifying) thing in this episode though is Grisha's reaction/pleading to Zeke (ZEKE! of all people, esp. since Zeke wants to euthanize every Eldian, a goal that is fundamentally against what Grisha stands for as a nationalist) to stop Eren's plan. Makes me really wonder how terrible/awful Eren's endgoal really is; and also holy hell I am so curious/excited to see what Eren's real endgoal is now.
* And one more for the road, THESE EPISODES GO BY SO QUICKLY.",huwgflh,sga0gi,attackontitan,2022-01-30 21:58:13,538,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,tkv_is_pro,"1. Damn, they really cut back to showing Grisha's slaughter of the entire family (save Rod Reiss) in detail, just to pad out the episode length eh.  
What a brutal scene nonetheless  


  
2. I guess Eren isn't omniscient with regard to the future.  
Much prefer it this way tbh; an overpowered protagonist is no fun.  
On a side note, he really is batshit crazy with his willpower, breaking his hands free of the chains like that.  


  
3. And there it is, the title card that illustrates just how meticulous the author of this story has planned everything out since DAY ONE.  A story almost a decade in the making (anime release time) (Season 1, EP1 (2013) title - ""To You, 2,000 Years From Now""; Season 4P2, EP5 (2022) title - ""From You, 2,000 Years Ago"")  
For the manga, I'd assume it's about the same length of time.  
Just insane levels of story boarding/ planning.  


  
4. (Wall) Maria, Rose, and Sina … oh my, there really is no wasted detail in this story  


  
5. Well now we know Eren's real plan and ... jesus christ Eren, batshit crazy doesn't begin to describe what you are.  
  


6. A while ago, I had a thought that Attack On Titan is the origin story of a villain, and this episode kind of validates me I feel.  
  


7. On a side note, this is what Game of Thrones tried and HORRENDOUSLY FAILED at doing with Daenerys Targaryen (yes I am still INCREDIBLY salty at just how bad that show ended).

If this ep’s flashbacks are true (and it seems they are) then the true story (as some other commenter astutely pointed out) comes instead from the “hallucigenia” looking ‘thing’ gifting titan powers to Ymir — apropos nothing — to save her life.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,AudaciousXII,"I honestly cannot believe how amazing this show is and how good the music is also. This episode is what I always wanted as well. It’s been a crazy ride and this season has split the fan base so much with the extremists views and has gotten to how life is today. Weirdly I always wanted Eren to do this, I was team Eren but not team jaegerist if that made sense. More so because even though Floch is so well written. I could not stand their mission when they had 300 of their men turned into titans and were alright with murdering Levi because he wanted revenge on the man who killed all the scouts.   

This world in my eyes was probably like 5-10 countries and were full alright with paradis being wiped out which is why Eren really had not many other options. He had 4 years left and only once chance to access the rumbling. Willy Tybur also convinced the whole world what eren was going to do prior to him attacking. What he did not count for is that the jaegerist were people carrying over the same hate that he wanted to end too and eldia would probably would split anyway and the cycle would still continue. I’m glad they showed those citizens from marley acting like devils because people have forgotten how awful Marley has been and what they created. Like they were flat out about to murder a kid because he stole a purse and his race. Eren saw there was no hope left and people will continue to lose their freedom because of their race and because of Marley.  

It was great to see the whole gang back together and something i have totally have missed the last 27 episodes. Eren was always like this but damn if mikasa did not choke there things probably could have changed. He totally said those words to her in season 4 because he was hurt and no clue why she really cares for him that much. But his view to Historia definitely brought up something I didn’t think before and how people are forced to eat their parents because of this world and the fact they are sentenced  for only 13 years to live. Like honestly it is so wrong but same time all the shit he says and how awful it is. Realistically paradis would fall and the people he loves would die by the time eren dies.

Overall, another great episode. I like everyone's reaction to being in what to them seems like a whole new world and their party with the refugees. I especially loved the little hints that at this point in time, Eren's still dealing with what he saw and wrestling with the idea that it's fate.

I'm glad we finally saw Historia again and that but man oh man, Eren's expression while explain everything to Zeke and then us finally seeing him cut off his leg and gouge out his eye, was....*chef's kiss*. Also, did anyone else peep his face during the flashback to Sasha's death? I like how we see it's one of shock and horror, I didn't like how his laugh in the sub sounded genuine, dub did it better.

And the Rumbling, good god it's just as terrifying as I'd hoped. An unstoppable force and an unmovable object at the same time wielded by the most dangerous man in the world.

Glad we saw how everything started with Ymir, that poor girl, she didn't deserve any of that but the fact that she obeyed for so long is still strange to me.

Seeing Eren's Founding Titan and the beginning of the Rumbling was so worth it, we've waited so long

Now a few thoughts: Is there any significance to Eren's Founding Titan having the form really similar to a hallucigenia? Do Titan shifter's die after thirteen years because Ymir wanted it that way or because she died thirteen years after getting her power?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,daskrip,"My biggest question from over 8 years ago, **""why do the Titans exist?""**, has finally been answered. And the more I think about the answer, the more satisfied I get.

At first I considered that maybe they're just a part of the universe and a random element written in to cause lots of drama. But I slowly came to realize just how calculative Isayama is, and thought that maybe there really is an explanation for why Titans coexist with humans. But to give a satisfying origin story for something so intricately developed over so long seemed impossible. And yet, I LOVE how it got explained. 

A parasitic disease is just so fitting. Sure, there are a few logical leaps to take, but *way* fewer than I thought was possible. Parasites do change the biology of organisms, and they could spread to other organisms. 

Why 9 Titans? It's a biological limiter. Biology is a perfect way to restrict a function to a certain numerical limit, as we see this in real life all the time with animals' bodies, such as cats having no more than 10 nipples.

Why 13 years? That's how long the parasite lived in Ymir's body. It remembered that length of time, and programmed it into every subsequent host.

I'm even satisfied with why Subjects of Ymir were under the control of the royal family all these years. The parasite memorized Ymir's psychological state wherein she's subservient to the royal family, and so all subsequent hosts inherited the same trait. It's not completely realistic, but still, THIS IS SUCH A GREAT WAY TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. A parasite just makes sense.

I did like the talk of Marley problems how they will never allow Eldians to be free which is what Eren is fighting for freedom for Eldians. However he’s making Paradis more like Marley by murdering people and arm bands. This episode explored issues with Paradis showing us that Paradis could be as shitty as Marley because while they are punishing those who are racist to Eldians what are they doing to those who are racist to Marley? It could just be Marley all over again but with reversed roles.

I’m hyped for episode 17 when that comes out but I wasn’t really satisfied with this episode mostly because I don’t like cliffhangers especially cliffhangers that end when all the action is about to go down.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,YaboiGh0styy,"Episode 14 was brutal Eren hating Mikasa because she’s a slave and then beating Armin was hard to watch even if I knew it was coming because spoilers. Also the rematch with Levi and Zeke was awesome even if 3D monke didn’t look good. And then the Yeagerists just go ahead and have the 109th cadets beat Kieth possibly to death. As if that wasn’t enough we have Zeke get tortured by Levi in a scene which I’m surprised was able to air on television you got Zeke with the thunder spear in the side and exposed wounds all over his body. 

Zeke’s backstory was really sad do you just wanted to have a childhood but Grisha was a pretty shit father and yes I know he wants revenge for his sister and his aunt after he heard she was eaten alive by dogs that doesn’t excuse what he did to Zeke and honestly I don’t blame Zeke for doing what he did. The closest thing he had to a father was the previous beast titan Tom Ksaver and all they did was talk and play catch just goes to show how badly he was treated by Grisha then at least his father isn’t Rodd Riess. Zeke also shows just how much he cares about Eren in this episode despite knowing nothing about him other than he is his half brother he goes to paradis to save him from Grisha. even though he didn’t need saving. He also gives Eren Tom’s baseball which was really nice seven giving Zeke some much needed character development. And Zeke isn’t dead they wouldn’t kill of a major character like that plus if he’s dead it would mean Eren would fight against the Titans alone (this is in a spoiler it’s pretty obvious it’s gonna happen in Pieck wouldn’t invade Paradis alone) which I really hope isn’t the case because I want to see the brothers fighting side-by-side.",grskgms,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-22 10:17:10,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

His entire speech is riddled with contradictions. He calls Armin a slave but he has the founding Titan which is the ultimate slaver of anyone’s will. Dude has memories of three lines of Titan shifters and has the audacity to call Armin a slave? 

He says Mikasa will always be compelled to protect him but in season 1, Eren insulted Armin and Mikasa punched him in the face. In season 3, Eren told Mikasa how much she meant to him and said he would wrap that scarf around her as many times as he would have too. 

When Armin was about to die, Eren cried in front of Levi to tell him how much Armin wanted to see the world and how if anyone would save the world it would  be Armin. 

When Eren tells Armin they never fought because they both understood the skill gap between them, he wants Armin to take that as a hint that he’s bluffing big time. Those tow never fought not because the fight would be unfair but because they’re best friends and love each other. 

Eren knows Armin is smart and will figure out all of these contradictions and eventually Mikasa will tok after they’ve both calmed down. 

Someone also pointed out to me that Eren saying the fight between them isn’t fair is a hint for Armin to go colossal next time they have to brawl in order to close the skill gap.

Not to mention the baseball Eren had and the fact that they are brothers and Titans so they could have some kind of other worldly connection. Zeke was also not trapped with Pieck and Porko but that mysterious guard. To me, it has also seemed that Zeke distrusts the marleyan military somewhat as in the very first episode of this season, Colt asks him what’s special about Zeke’s blood, and Zeke recognizing that Magath is nearby give Colt a humorous answer.

So, what I am puzzled about is the whole 9 titan shifter thing. Ymir never split her powers, so did that happen by ""accident""? Basically her first three daughter inherited a third of her ability? And then their daughters/sons inherited more that it became 9 in the end? But if they still ate each other everytime someone died why did it stop at 9 and not split even further down every time? Especially since it works in the way, that if someone of those 9 dies, someone completely different inherits the power (I guess it's the next born then, but they don't have to be directly related to the one that died as far as I understood it). 

Furthermore, the original Eldian people were not able to transform into Titans, only the descendants of Ymir did. But all of them were supposed to always eat their dead family members. So why is there even a difference between royal family and non royal family? Everyone is a descendant of Ymir after all? And it's not like there was potential inbreeding to keep the blood pure. I mean, Ymir's daughters were already not pure-blood anymore and they were only daughters, so the next descendant would be even less pure of blood. Did the original Ymir family split at some point and one half just stopped eating each other so the ""royal family"" was the one that ""kept the tradition alive""? But I guess in the end, this wasn't necessary either as Zeke was just royal blood (and he was half and half as well, so it doesn't seem like there needs to be pure blood to begin with to be considered royal).

Now we have a character that's basically the mastermind behind the whole story, the character who has been influencing the events of the story. And I personally don't understand why authors like to include a character like that (typically it's in Shounen where they have to make the final antagonist seem to be powerful, but here, I don't know why you would even go for it). It takes away from characters actions as they never had a choice to begin with (similar like with the Ackermann DNA twist). Yes, I get it's part of the ""freedom"" theme the anime goes for, but I don't think it was necessary. I mean, all that's left now is to show that Eren has been influencing Events even before that to really hammer home that there is this one character who has been behind everything.

Further, Eren was able to communicate with Grisha only because Zeke was showing him Grisha's memories, which Zeke could do because he's a royal. Other than this one instance, I don't think we have seen Eren demonstrate the ability to ""send"" memories to past Attack Titans or even access their memories. He only knows Grisha's memories because of what Grisha wrote in his diary. 

The implication is that Eren hasn't really been pulling the strings all along. It's only after he kissed Historia's hand that he would have seen Grisha's memories and would have come to realize what was in store for the future.

They brought this upon themselves, and they deserve it.

On the other hand, these civilians did not make those decisions and they don't deserve it. If all of this goes back to the murder of Eren's mom, how many mothers and families have been killed by him just now? I'm certainly not happy to see him become the very monster he swore to destroy, consumed by hatred.

1) Why did Ymir return to being a slave after obtaining the power of the founding organism? Is it really as simple as ""It was all she ever knew""? Because she clearly hated being a slave and didn't love her king. Why did she continue to serve the will of the royals while in the paths?


2) Based on how the coordinate tree grew three branches when her children ate her remains, and then grew many more branches when they had kids and their kids had kids, it seems like you could surmise that all subjects of Ymir are descendants of her and the king's children. So if that's the case, shouldn't all subjects of Ymir be royal blood, and therefore be able to use the founding Titans power?


3) The impression I got based on the name of the episode and the line Eren says to Ymir is that Ymir essentially reached out to Eren for help, and the dream he had as a child in the first episode was him connecting with Ymir.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SHADOWSTRIKE1,"Dude I'm so fucking confused and blown away at the same time.

So what I can determine, the Attack Titan can pass down memories to those who came before.  To me, this would mean that originally, Grisha must have passed on the Attack Titan to Eren, who must have seen some terrible future, and thus influenced Grisha in the past to not only take the Attack Titan, but also take the Founding Titan, so that Eren would then inherit both.  That's the only way I can see them get out of the paradox of Eren needing to initially persuade Grisha in the first place.

So Eren may actually be the bad guy after all?  And if everything that's happened has been influenced and predetermined by Eren through passing down information through the years... then he must also have known about Zeke's whole ""vow loophole"" and passed that down and prepared for it.  I need some sort of recap episode that pieces together all the important bits and pieces from over the seasons to help me grasp everything that's been passed down and influenced.

Also, I still want Eren to eat all other Titans and become some **Mega Titan**.

If you think about it, what King would ever resign his throne to the children of the slaves he owns, even if they were powerful weapons. I believe that's the reason they couldn't erase their families memories and the other royals + the king's personal guard's memories. It's because what slave would ever have the power to do so.

Also, I think the rumbling isn't what we thought it was. It was never meant to defend them or to be used as a threat. It was meant for Ymir's revenge against the world, because if you think about it, not only has she been a slave for the amount of years numbers cannot express, but she's also seen all her people's suffering.

Plus I don't think we should call them eldians from now on. The eldians are just fucking degenerates who abused Ymir and the Subjects of Ymir. If you think about it, everyone has been doing so. The marlians, the royals in eldia and the whole world. There has't been a point in history where her people have been free, which is why the Rumbling is her revenge upon the whole world.

I don't even think Eren wants it to happen, but he saw Ymir's memories and all her Subjects' suffering, and both him and Ymir decided that's the only way.

I know better than to try and predict this show. But with Eren going wild and basically becoming the Bad Guy, there are three ways I can see this ending. 

1, the Scouts and etc turn on Eren and defeat him. They are sad but understand that, uh, murdering the entire world isn't a great idea. Most people on earth survive. 

2, Eren successfully kills everyone outside Paradis, making the people (who used to be ) within the walls the only humans that survived. might have to erase some memories while he's at it. Right back to square one except without titans probably

3. Eren wins but AT WHAT COST? Kills a bunch of Eldians and friends. Maybe everyone ever since I feel like a lot of Eldians would oppose his idea. And he Realizes he went too far. I'm thinking like Devilman levels of chaos and depression and world-ending

I like 1 and 3 best. I feel like 1 isn't very likely, though.

And what even counts as royal blood, since everyone is a descendant of King Fritz. Does it go by eldest daughter? If that's the case shouldn't most of the population have royal blood? This doesn't make much sense. How could you even tell who's royalty after 2000 years of reproduction.

Also what's the whole deal with Titans needing sunlight to regenerate. Why can Ymir only build Titans in sunlight. Does she require solar energy, is it related to the water bug thing.

What are the 9 Titans? Did Ymir's granddaughters eat her children resulting in more intelligent titans? If so why didn't they keep doing so. Would the process work only so many times before Ymir's powers were spread out too thin? Or did they just stop eating Titan Shifters' body for no reason. If three people ate Eren's body, would they all inherit each of his three titan powers?

So they are betraying all their people and stopping the only thing protecting them from the world committing genocide on them because they had fun with some guy that one time...that's not enough for me to believe they would betray the island especially since if any of those people knew they were eldians they would have been spat on them and attacked them instead. 

That big meeting scene was random and I didn't really understand it since it came and went so fast. But the gist seems to be a bunch of people saying they should kill everyone on Paradis.

Third generation (at least 9)  (y/k+???)

Fourth+ generation: ???

You see, the third generation of titan wielders extermite other races and history, then force the victims to breed children for them. But problem is, they're not only descendents of ymir, but king fritz as well. There's 2 definition that i could think of, but i cant even convice myself

i) inbreeding: the titan wielders not only make children with prisoners of war, but also make children with other descendent of king fritz (by fritz's other wifes)

ii) ymir having children with other people: this is the most unlikely point. How can a slave like ymir get with other men? Plus, she's actually in love with fritz, i doubt that she'll cheat on fritz

He then proceeded to want to walk Eren down memory lane.

In order for Zeke to know what memories to show Eren, would he have not had to walk through all of the history thus seeing how it played out prior to “showing Eren”?

So guess this could explained either by arrogance of Zeke (possible). 

or that the past was not changed yet as Eren had to be present to affect the past. This though would create issues with how AoT plays out timeline fixedness as Zeke would be viewing the past NOT viewing the past prior to Eren interfering. The key being in order for Zeke to see an “untainted” historical event then a butterfly effect view of time would have to be present which contradicts how AoT is presenting “time travel” theory.

This season has also shown them also at war with another nation, so their end game is to obtain all titans and rule the world right?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OGFN_Jack,"Honestly the greatest thing for me about this episode was just being able to truly realize how much the tides had turned throughout the years. 

Just 5 (?) years ago the scouts achieved their first real victory ever when most of their new recruits were slaughtered and their titan proved he had little to no control over himself because they plugged a hole in the wall that had been created easier than you can count to 3. Fast forward to season 3 and you have less than 10 soldiers come as close as possible to killing the armored titan, someone with 0 confirmed titan kills and a half conscious titan defeat the colossal titan (and be able to absorb his powers), and one single soldier defeat the beast titan with ease and force him to flee at the mere sight of him. 

Then you get to the most recent two episodes of season 4 and watch Reiner’s heart drop as their pure fear he has of Eren arises when he sees them, Pieck look on in astonishment and fear as she sees that ODM once again, and Gaillard be in complete disbelief as a bunch of ordinary humans swoop down on him to finish off one of the 9 titans with no second thought in their mind. 

I recently just binged AOT up until the most recent episode, so maybe it clicked for me later than some of you.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,OGFN_Jack,"Because people still can't seem to understand why the Eren and Gabi comparison makes 0 sense I will try to go through every point as clear as possible.

Eren and Gabi's hometowns were both attacked by foreign enemies that is true. However, lets look at the circumstances between the two

**Paradis/Eren**

* Paradis is a place surrounded by gigantic walls, as massive titans who eat them roam their island. These walls effectively trap the majority of the population in a place where they can never leave as they fear the titans who for some unknown reason inhabit their island eat any human they see.
* One random day, two very powerful titans attack Eren's hometown for an unknown reason. Slaughtering half the population, including Eren's mom, thus fueling Eren's hatred for Titans as they killed his people, his mom, and destroyed the town he lived for a reason he does not know.
* He joins the scouts and ends up learning he has the power of the attack titan. He uses this power to liberate his people from the titan threat, watching many of his comrades fall along the way and learns that a place called Marley has been sending titans to their island for years, and sent Reiner and co. there to recover something called The Founding Titan. Learning that he has more enemies responsible for so much death and destruction, he sets out towards Marley to get his revenge

**Marley/Gabi**

* Marley is a country that is run by a government that forces Eldians to live in an interment zone and fight in wars Marley starts.
* Gabi is a part of a select few group of talented kids are selected to be apart of their program where they are going to be injected with something that turns them into killing machines with the potential to wipe out an entire city if they wanted to. 
* These powers that they will receive will allow them to travel to Paradis and exterminate the entire island. The people of Paradis have never left their island to attack Marley, yet apparently they are ""devils"" and a ""threat to world peace"". Gabi is determined to achieve the role of the armored titan, and as someone who has already murdered hundreds, is overjoyed at the opportunity to go to Paradis and wipe them all out. 
* As her country declares war publicly on Paradis, Gabi is ecstatic to attack these people, even though she has never once seen first hand that they are of any threat to her and has only been told. As this announcement happens, Eren and co. attack destroying Gabi's hometown and killing multiple of her friends.
* As she prepares to attack them, Falco, someone who has gone through the exact same experience as her, tells her that he learned that the reason they are doing this is because they were attacked years ago by none other than Reiner and co. 
* Even though this is a wildly dumb claim to make up, and knowing that Falco is just as upset as her Gabi decides to use the logic that if she didn't see it, then it didn't happen and ignores this. Even after hearing this, Gabi's thirst for blood doesn't settle, and she sneaks on board the ship, killing Sasha.

If you read all of this, and think that there are any real similarities outside of the fact that their homes were attacked, then I'm really not sure what else to tell you.",gljko5e,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 02:04:39,6,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

1. Reiner explained that the reason he destroyed the wall was so that they could slip into the chaos. Was it necessary to break the wall? Absolutely not.

2. Tybur KNEW this attack was coming and knowingly set up the stage and groups of people so that they would die. So is it really just Eren in the wrong or is it Marley as well for allowing this to happen?

This is war. Yes, Eren could've taken the peaceful route, but do you really think that the Marleyan's would have taken the peaceful route in eradicating all of Paradis Island? Do you think that if Eren somehow killed nobody in his attack that Marley wouldn't sacrifice their own people to benefit themselves?

Eren may be the bad guy but someone needed to be. I love Mikasa and her peaceful mindset, but it's kill or be killed especially when Tybur had just declared war.

Next we don't know how much the memories affect the current shifter. Eren accused Armin of being affected by Bertholdt's memory. Eren himself must've been affected by the Owl.

I think Eren's goal is to eat ALL of the titans (he now has 3: founding, attack + war hammer) so that he can control all 9.. But not for military superiority, but so that he can eliminate titan control and hand down the curse of the titans in order to remove their existence from the earth for the benefit of humanity. he was inches from taking Galliard in this episode, too.

Of course, him not going for Beast or Cart (and Beast seemingly being killed) this episode might poke holes in this... and maybe there are more holes I'm not thinking of cause I'm still buzzing from this episode... but i don't know. seems like it might fit.

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

\- the constant reversals of 'Team Marley' having advantage - quickly followed by the scouts reversing was amazing

\- I say it every week, but I am so glad we got to know these new characters before we saw this stuff, it matters SO much more when they are at odds.

\- Loved the coordination of the scouts. Levi using the opening to take out the Beast was surreal. I will be irritated Zeke he survives this.. but I feel like he will because we may have more to learn from him? As in a final confrontation with Eren?

\- Eren using the Jaw titan as a 'tool' was both one of the most badass and simultaneously terrifying moments of the show for me.

\- I was hopeful that Reiner was going to drift off peacefully, but of course he can't.. I think we are finally getting ready to say goodbye to his character after some great development.

\- the music was really great this episode

First, I'm crying because I just realised we'll never again see the happy-go-lucky cast we all love so much. Those 15 year olds who made jokes and smiled at each other are gone. From here on out were going to see adults weighed down by the blood of thousands, all to aware that they have no right to be happy. 

Secondly, I'm honestly glad that they're getting their revenge but they're ultimately proving the Marleyans right by doing so. They no longer have the chance to say ""you were wrong about us"" and they've truly chosen to become the devils they were portrayed as for decades.

I've managed to avoid spoilers so far so believe me when I say I genuinely don't know who will die, but when they do, it's likely that they wont feel fear as the people in the previous seasons did, but rather see their deaths as an atonement for their sins.

Basically the only path they can take is to become an imperial power and enter into an almost never ending war, just like Marley had.

Now, tie all of that together with Sasha. All she wanted was to reclaim her farmland so that she could enjoy delicious food and a peaceful life. That peace will never come to the eldians of paradis island, and Sasha has shown us how terrible war can be.

The scene where Eren body slams the crowd felt way less pronounced, and his improved crystal knuckle formation couldn't even be appreciated properly. In the manga, you could see how Eren has learned to stretch the formation all the all the way past the wrists.

But moreso than the animation is the actual directing itself, the cuts, pacing, the time spent on certain shots. It's not ***awful****,* but it's definitely underwhelming.

Compare the Warhammer Titan fight with Levi v. Beast Titan fight, and you'll see the gulf of difference in tightness, pacing, and integration with music, which I also thought was poorly done.

Plot, direction and music wise the episode was awesome, so far each new episode has been better than the last. That said, I could only feel sad as I watched what could have been one of the most awesome action scenes so far held back by animation. I'm sure mappa is doing the best they can with the time they were given, cutting only the necessary corners due to time constraints and during non-busy scenes the art and animation is just as good as it's always been. But during the action scenes it doesn't compare, the cgi is very noticeable and immersion breaking and the camera angles are not nearly as complex. I tried thinking of it more like an animated manga with voices instead of a full on anime but I still couldn't help feeling sad that we couldn't keep the 10/10 going on this final stretch. I feel like once again people are only thinking in complete extremes, either being full on hateful dicks or praising mappa to high heaven for a flawless adaptation even better than seasons 1-3 and nobody is being honest/fair. They are obviously very skilled and passionate and that shows, they did their best with what they were given and they deserve our respect for that. However the compromises are obvious and that's the truth of it imo. It's not bad but it doesn't hold up to the standard it's set so far which imo has been a benchmark for the industry in general. Even if we had to wait another 2 years I'd have much preferred that personally instead of a rushed adaptation. Once again people in suits who want the money and don't give a shit have messed with something people love, and mappa who are doing their best to patch up their shitty decision are taking all the backlash.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hydralo,"I was so hyped but I have to say I was watching and everything was beautifully done, the people, the backstory of the way they anticipated the attack etc. But when they switched to erens 3d model it looked so weird, it feels like they just move his limbs without warping the face or anything, as if it were a mech. SSSS gridman vibes.


Then there was also some 3d very well hidden due to camera angles and by mixing in some gorgeous 2d animation for some the hammer titan and eren scenes. But then, again when eren got impailed with the 3d spike around the 10 minute mark, they showed his 3d model just lying there like a mecha suit at 9:26-9:29 and i was completely out of it.


Also something I noticed was they have also used 3d models for the paradis people. They painted over them well but the way they move and speak to each other, they move in a very stiff robotic way that i've seen in other shows before. 15:13-15-17, is all cgi movement for example. Also, in 15:19-15:21 right after seems just so stiff. Their faces and mouths are also done in a way that you can barely tell which character is which, like sasha and connie are very animated expressive people normally. 



That's all. It is what it is I guess. I think they showed they know how to mask the 3d with 2d animation cause when they did it, it was so smoothly done, so they might fix them later for the season's release for blu ray. Maybe they could do some dramatic close ups with 2d drawings to make things looks smoother during the fights, we'll see in like a year when it comes out.",gjo7bfz,kz8wir,attackontitan,2021-01-18 02:10:51,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sinplyevanlopez,"One thing I’d like to point out is how the War Hammer doesn’t have ent interest in Eren himself. It’s been stated that the War Hammer has been privately owned by the Tyburs for years now, and that they have no relation to Marley’s military. She tries to finish if Eren quickly and kill him instead of eating him and taking his powers. Frankly doing so would hurt Marley a lot more than help it, because then they’d have no idea who now has the Attack Titan and if it goes rogue it would harm everyone. This makes me think that she’s acting on her own personal vendetta? Like she couldn’t care less for war politics and instead is acting on her own moral compass and avenging the slaughtered. Since she’s not one for war, this makes me believe that she could essentially be a wildcard for either side to manipulate or sway to their side. Also, Mikasa says something of interest. She says, “Eren please... Come home.” This kinda hints that he went off on his own, that he’s a rogue soldier and none of this was part of their plan. Eren was definitely gambling on her and the rest of the Scouts chasing after him because of his later line. He says something like, “You guys actually came.” I think this means that the rest of the Scouts(probably lead by Jean, Levi, and Armin), are acting on their own. I think they plan on taking Eren and getting the hell out of there because they’re in enemy territory and they don’t time or supplies to hunker down and establish a base there. Speaking of Armin, we saw him in the last episode. I’m willing to bet that the bearded soldier who lead Pieck and Galliard to the trap was Armin. Considering his close proximity to the rest of his teammates, I don’t think that if he transforms, and that’s a big if, he’s gonna cause a lot of destruction. I think he’s gonna stay as a human and act as an impromptu strategist like always and get Eren and the squad back home. Few things of note in the second half. Magath is having the whole internment zone surrounded by soldiers and it makes me wonder how Armin is gonna get everyone out of there. Now I’m thinking that he might actually transform and carry everyone back to paradis. For the rumbling to happen, the Colossal Titans have to cross the ocean so the sea must not be more than 60 meters deep. Also, Gabi ran off with a gun from one of her dead buddies into the war zone. I don’t think she dies here because they just killed off Udo and Zofia. This also makes me think that Falco’s still alive as well. These two got a lot more development, and they’re both interesting characters. Lastly, the War Hammer is controlled remotely with its user encased in a hardened shell much like how Annie was at the end of season 1. This means that Annie’s still alive, and since Erens trying to eat the War Hammer that means his jaw can break through the case meaning he can probably get Annie out of there. Annie was genuinely remorseful for what she did and she hated the whole mission in the first place. She wanted to go back after Marcel was eaten. She might honestly join Erens side. That’s all I have for this episode, keep in mind I’m an anime only and these are just my thoughts so please don’t spoil anything if you know.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,absolutelynose,"Okay I have to let this out, I hate this season so far. It has been a huge disappointment since episode 1 but I've been holding it back since people kept saying to wait for it, it's gonna be worth it. It has not. Why do I have to look at the world through the perspective of the people outside of Paradis? They are exactly as evil as Eren and the Paradis people think they are. That piece of shit Gabi is annoying, arrogant, spoiled and eager to kill human beings. Stop fucking comparing her to Eren in the past. Eren saw his mom being eaten ALIVE. He knew nothing, he couldn't understand why it had to happen. This piece of shit Gabi knows. She is hyped for the war declaration. They WANTED to START the war with Paradis first before Eren transformed. Your people wanted to start the chain of violence and you don't understand WHY? 

Story aside, what have the animators done to our characters? They all have chubby looking face. You can barely recognize Mikasa if it's not thanks to her voice, she looks like a freaking man! The CGs kill all the hype moments. Remember how badass Levi, Mikasa were???

Ffs, I don't care how the people outside of the world feels, why don't you give me the perspective of Eren of the scouts? WHY has the main character of the show changed???

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kitsune-oni,"Couple of thoughts. 

1) Armin with beard. Armin has a beard. Bearded Armin. 

2) These first five episodes have made me feel so much for Reiner that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. Like homie just constantly has it rough and can never catch a break. He was doing what he thought was right. If anything its the Marleys fault. So...

3) Why can't Eren just scoop of the Eldians in Marley and have them all live in Paradis? It seems like a reasonable idea. Eldians in Marley are treated poorly ans they'll never be ""equal."" But by moving to Paradis and joining forces together, they could be equal. Given, the islanders would probably resent the Eldians, but its better than living in Marley, right? 

4) And why pit Titans/Eldians/Paradis Islanders together? Yall are the exact same. I kinda hope Falco sees that (if he's still alive) and tries to bring everyone together. The Titan race could literally take over the world if they wanted to. So why do the Marlyean Titans stand by Marley so much if they're mistreated? I understand its for their families. But do they not see that there's so much in common between them and Paradis? Is ""Paradis = Bad"" just so far ingrained in their minds at this point?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sassyaspho,"Can we please talk more about how BADASS Jean and Sasha were in this episode!! The adrenaline rush when Jean took out the Cart and Sasha with that deadass aim!

And Armin! Let’s just say he got out of the friend zone and went 0-100 real quick! But on a serious note, I feel so bad for him. The pain that he must feel with how much destruction his Colossal can do. He’s so kind hearted that I’m sure all of this will weigh on him. It definitely makes you feel bad for the innocent victims in Marley. But the same goes for all the innocent in Paradis when Marley attacked too. That’s the thing about war, everyone gets hurt regardless of what side they’re on. 

I can’t wait to see more Hange!

Levi and Zeke seemed suspiciously short lived. I think there’s more to Zeke than meets the eye. I’m really starting to think he’s another Owl. I started to question his role when he wasn’t escorted to the pit with Porco and Pieck. 

(Side note: it’s basically confirmed that soldier that trapped them in the pit wasn’t Armin too since he was in the boat. So that was definitely someone else undercover 100%)

And Eren is a damn savage!! It was so badass how he would just pop out and transform again whenever his Titan was done. Definitely shows how much he has been mastering his control. Don’t get me wrong, it was a crazy move using Porco as a Titan nutcracker and I was hyped watching it! But at the same time it felt so inhuman and monster-like to use the Jaw that way to crush the Warhammer. I think its showing how far Eren is willing to go (and probably then some) to do what he feels is just. I kinda wish he would have just taken the Jaw too while he had him but I can’t wait to see how he will use his new Warhammer powers in the next episode!

I also hope poor Reiner gets put out of his misery soon. I feel so bad for the guy!

Very confused with what Eren did in the end. Even though it looked fucking bad ass. I felt Eren is going to follow his father to become a revolutionary for Eledian everywhere but straight up killing them makes me feel he doesn't care about anyone but people living in the walls.

Why did the event take place in interm zone, also I'm pretty sure Magath and Willy knew about Eren being here. References the rat in last episode and Magath not surprised when his people when missing. It is ok for a Titan fight as long as it takes place in Interm zone.

That must be Armin.. there is no other option according to me. Looks taller than Eren tbh was that because of Collosal 😂😂 well even previous Collosal was tall 😂.

Zekes scene with Levi was so weird. He has to be the conspirator behind this attack. They just had to make it seem like Levi killed Zeke, so he can escape with the guys from Paradis.

The Owl probably told Zeke as a child what his role was. He had to turn in his parents, so Grisha would get taken to Paradis. Grisha then inherites the Attack Titan, gives it to Eren who‘s mission is to free all Eldians from the oppression of Marley? On the other hand... Eren did kill many of them. Idk but

Zeke said in episode 2 of this season to Colt, who‘d inherit the Beast titan after him, that Colt would get behind his secret as soon as he‘s the beast titan... yeah, Zeke afterwards said his secret how he wipes his ass, but he probably had his life as a double agent in mind.

It reminds me of Itachis burden. Although Zeke probably hasn‘t that kind of bond with any person from Marley.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NickBooms,"I had this idea in my head after the conversation between Eren and Reiner for ""Declaration of War"" but after this episode with conversations between Falco and Gabi along with Eren and Levi it is now certain: this show is great. I know this is an obvious statement but here me out.

I became a big fan of Game of Thrones and one thing that always stood out is that you cared about the conversations just as much, if not more than, the combat. There was no filler because each scene just added another brick to the path the story was following. Not only that, but you always felt excited when two characters who you know well finally meet, whether it's their first time meeting or it's a long-awaited reunion. 

AOT has become just that. The back-and-forth dialogue between Eren and Reiner showed the regrets Reiner still has along with the undying rage Eren feels. Falco telling Gabi the true reason why their friends died and her ignoring this information shows a dark path in her future if left unchanged. Levi scolding Eren while also filling the viewers in on the fact that no one wanted this to happen leaves even more room for conflict. At this point I don't care if there's an epic showdown, what I want to see is a genuine debate between Eren and Gabi and hopefully a revelation showing that they're really two sides of the same coin. That is why I think this show is great, and it's been a while since I've felt that way about any of the shows I've watched in the past few years.",gljcr9v,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 01:01:55,17,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wing_Fish1302,"I don't usually post on this subreddit (Or Reddit in general), so I preemptively apologize if I make any mistakes. I just wanted to dump my thoughts here.

Haha, what an episode. I put it up there with 'Declaration of War' for favorite episodes of this season. I loved the adrenaline rush of the last few episodes, but episodes like this really make me stick around AoT/SnK. If anything, these types of episodes enhance the action for me.

Unfortunately, I got spoiled on Sasha's death a while back, so it didn't hit as hard, but it was still sad, especially on re-watches (The music and characters' reactions really sell it). 

I'm seeing quite a bit of discussion around Gabi and Eren this time around (For anime-only people, at least). I mean, there was already, but this episode seems to have struck a nerve. Although there is responsibility to go around, I honestly don't really blame anyone. 

Gabi is responsible for pulling the trigger and physically killing Sasha, but I also chalk a good amount of it up to her actions being a product of the environment she's grown up in and a natural reaction for someone in her position to have. Again, she's still responsible, but I personally don't harbor any anger towards Gabi. 

Eren...is complicated. Although a war with Marley seems like it was going to happen either way, Eren chose the battlefield and kicked off this specific sequence of events that led to this specific occurrence of Sasha's death (It can never be truly known whether Sasha would or would not have survived in any other given alternative), but I see her death as being an indirect consequence of Eren's actions. I wouldn't absolve Eren of responsibility, but I wouldn't consider him completely or directly responsible. 

In the end, I don't really blame or feel any anger towards anyone. I just feel sad that Sasha died. Rest in potatoes, Sasha, you will be missed. 

Yet, regardless of who's really to blame and who's not, I feel that one of the important takeaways from this is that, justified or not, some of the Scouts blame Eren and, even more importantly, Eren blames himself. 

Regardless, the hardest part of these types of discussions is that we'll never know what could've happened. We can theorize about what would've happened if Eren didn't decide to launch an attack on Liberio on that day at that time, but we can never truly know what the outcome would've been (Especially for a show that's all about things going wrong). It also doesn't help that we're barely out of the Liberio arc, so we - and the characters - can really only speculate about what the consequences of Eren's actions will be until the anime releases more episodes (Even then, it'll probably be a chaotic, morally grey mess). So, until then, I consider myself pretty neutral in this conflict. 

But back to the episode itself, I think it was very strong. It's so impressive how much can be conveyed through lingering on a character's facial expression. I love how much was said this episode without it actually being said. You can feel the conflict and tension in the air that's been developing over the last four years, even if we haven't yet seen the full extent of what happened during that time. I really look forward to what comes next.

Gosh, I love this show so much. That's probably my adrenaline rush from the last episode talking, but I think Season 4 is off to such a strong start. There are certainly elements I miss from the early episodes/seasons of the show (I do miss when titans were these horrifying, larger-than-life, and unknowable threats, but I absolutely love the direction the show is going in). I also love coming on the AoT and SnK subreddits after each episode to see the memes, art, insightful analyses, and theories that people have. As much as I am tempted to wait until the whole season releases to binge it, the experience after each episode is worth it.",glntcof,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 23:49:23,15,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

The two sides in this war are NOT morally equivalent. One side has concentration camps, a deeply racist population, indoctrinated child soldiers on the front lines, and just held a big ""we declare genocidal war"" rally. The other side has been fighting a desperate war of self-defense against slave soldiers (basically what the mindless titans are, they're sent to attack the walls against their will) and has finally had a chance to strike back at a military target. Yes there were civilian casualties, but the attack targeted the military harbor and the assembly of military brass. That's a hell of a lot less civilian death than Hiroshima but people are perfectly comfortable accepting that attack was justified.

Either way, this was another great episode and this and Assault really remind me of Hero/Midnight Sun. The former is the big exciting climax to the battle while the latter is the quiet but still emotional aftermath. Lots of interesting new developments this episode too, Zeke is in cahoots with Paradise as I expected and Gabi and Falco are hostages. That leaves Marley with Pieck, Galliard, a suicidal Reiner and zero young warrior candidates. How the turn tables.

Going to be completely honest though, and please no one take this the wrong way, I've always thought Sasha felt a bit out of place in the show. She was entertaining and had that cool episode back in Season 2, but other than that I felt like she didn't have the same pathos as the rest of the cast and was just along for the ride. Though maybe that's the point, she was just a random and crazy girl that got caught up in this hectic war and became great friends with those involved. Despite that, it still hurt to see her die and especially everyone's reactions. Even seeing Mikasa and Eren get effected really drove home how devastating a loss this was. R.I.P.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Optimal_Bit_5600,"Damn, two episodes back to back was a treat. I did admittedly cave in and watch the 17 minute version of episode 14 last week, but it was still nice seeing the high quality, full version today along with episode 15.  As for my thoughts, 14 was a great follow up to last episode, giving us the long awaited EMA meeting and rematch between Zeke and Levi. The EMA meeting wasn't as lengthy as I expected, but was still a hard scene to watch due to Eren wrecking both of his best friends either mentally or physically. While I have a sneaking suspicion that Eren is putting up an act and doesn't mean what he's saying, the whole thing with Mikasa being manipulated by some generational brain-washing akin to the Reiss family was a hell of a twist. It's something that retroactively makes Mikasa much more interesting, and fixes my major issue with her in past seasons (being obsessive and over protective of Eren). Kudos to Armin for standing up to Eren too, even if he was no match in a fight. As for Levi vs Zeke, it may not have had the same fluid animation as Imai's action sequences, but much like episode 7 the direction and pacing still carried it. Considering the tight schedule, it turned out better than I expected, and the whole forest sequence was thrilling to watch overall.   


Now as good as 14 was, 15 is another story. This was a phenomenal episode that is right up there with Declaration of War and Assault as being among my favorite episodes this whole season. Genuinely feel really, really bad for Zeke, and while I don't agree at all with his plan, I completely understand where he's coming from. Poor kid had a shitty childhood, with that scene where Grisha was freaking out in the other room actually making me tense up as if I were right there alongside Zeke. It's just one of the many strengths of this story, how much perspective can alter things with this episode and That Day showing two sides of the same coin. And yeah that last scene looked gorgeous, definitely one of the best MAPPA has put out for this adaptation. Only one more episode left until we say goodbye for a bit, interested to see how they leave off this story before we head to the actual final stretch of episodes.",grryl6v,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-22 04:50:18,1,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Gabi and Falco are precisely where Eren, Armin and Mikasa were at the beginning. Having their lives blown apart (figuratively and literally) by these evil creatures.

But now they’re just committing the same evil onto more innocent people. Yes, the Marleyan government is evil. But are MARLIANS evil? Just like Eren and the gang before they found the basement, Marlians only have the information they’ve been given. They genuinely thought Paradis was full of evil people. Willy’s story was a revelation for them. They are just normal people put in a situation where they didn’t have a choice to pick sides, just like Paradis Eldians.

So what makes it ok for Eren and the gang to murder hundreds of them? Nothing. If anything, it’s worse, because they have more information than the everyday Marlian. They knew that the Marlian government was evil, but that Marlians didn’t really know what was going on.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,hibiscxs,"I am amazed that Reddit is the place I find the most rational discussion about the episode vs Twitter or Tumblr. The amount of Gabi hate I'm seeing there is crazy. People are seriously wishing death on her as revenge for killing Sasha/cheering for her getting beat up by the Scouts/joking that she should have killed Floch instead.

A lot of people are missing the point in Gabi killing Sasha. It's normal that people are angry about Sasha's death, especially if she was their favorite/ their comfort character. In fact, her death was the best choice for this moment, instead of Floch like I've heard people wishing (I mean, does anyone really *like* Floch?) or any of the other Scouts. Sasha was always the more light-hearted character of the main crew. Her death (and in such a pointless way, too) is a symbol that this final season *is not messing around*. There are no more comfort characters you can count on to smile and joke at the end of all this.

But back to the Gabi hate. Again, it's really understandable why people are mad about Sasha's death, and they need something to direct their anger too. I'm just so confused about how passionately and directly that hate is put to Gabi. 

You shouldn't hate Gabi. Not for killing Sasha, anyway. You can hate her for her personality (she's arrogant, that's for sure), but not for this. Gabi is literally a brainwashed child soldier. We know exactly what Marley feeds the Eldians in terms of Eldian history and the current situation about Paradis Island. We know exactly how the military ropes in their Eldian soldiers with their propoganda. We know that, to Gabi, the Scouts are devils who perpetuate the devilish legacy of the Eldians that Marley continues to use to oppress her people.

Does that justify her actions? Of course not. We know the truth about Marley and Paradis. We know that the people of Paradis aren't devils, and that they have been living in hell for years because of Marley. We know that the girl Gabi just killed wasn't a devil, but a girl who loved meat, who loved her friends, who only wanted to put an end to the hell conditions of Paradis.

But we also know the truth about the Eldians in Marley. We know that they're oppressed and tortured. We know Marley uses them as canon fodder. We know that the Eldians were force fed a nasty and false history that raised them to believe that they deserved the conditions they lived in, and that the only way they could atone for that was to live and kill and die in a war for their oppressors. We know that Eren knows this, and the Scouts probably know it too. We know that Eren and the Scouts just killed countless people who don't know the truth, and who only wanted to be free of their oppression.

There is no right side in the Gabi vs. Sasha situation. There is no right side when the people fighting are the Eldians of Paradis and the Eldians of Marley. They are only two wronged sides in an ugly war waged by Marley.

You should be mad about Sasha's death. It was pointless (not storytelling-wise, but in the context of the war). But the person to blame is not Gabi. The thing to blame is the war, because it's a tragedy. It's a tragedy that Sasha died so fruitlessly, that she had to live the life she did, the one that lead her to join the Scouts and kill monsters and watch her friends die and then kill people. It's a tragedy that the person to do it was Gabi, this kid who thinks she just killed a devil, that she's serving her people, who doesn't know the truth. Maybe she never will. Maybe she'll have lived and killed and died in a war for a country who thought of her as a weapon and never know it. Or maybe she *will* learn the truth, and realize that she killed people for that country, that her friends and family died for that country.

But that's the point of the story-- that there won't be a person like Sasha who comes out the other end smiling and joking. Instead, it'll be a person like Gabi, who might survive and return to Marley, waiting for a reprieve for her people that will never come, who might end up switching sides and fighting the rest of the war against her people who don't know better. Or there won't be anyone coming out on the other side at all.",glkoozx,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 08:20:56,9,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

If he followed the way of life being persecuted as an eladian he would have likely been a doctor with a family and kids. Dina Fritz would have never met him so no Zeke. He would have never inherited the Attack Titan and gone inside the walls and met Carla so Eren. No eren means Mikasa would have likely gone into Child sex trafficking ring and may have ended up in the same place as Levi's mom.

How are they gonna close the series cause the marley revelation is intense. 

I may have to read the manga cause it feels like anime is either leaving stuff out or really summarizing a bunch of stuff. 

Also it was brilliant to make the attack in the eladian. Quarters cause in real life any major attack doesn't happen in the rich areas it's usually the really poor areas.

I wonder why Zeke wouldn’t use this power to transform the Paradisans attacking into Titans? I know this would cause issues for Marley somewhat, including their soldiers that were there. But it seems like he can direct them somewhat, and think about it: a mindless titan Mikasa or Levi or Sasha is much less dangerous to the Marleyans than a trained scout with ODM gear and a plan they’re unaware of. He also could have done this during the suicide run at the end of season 3, all of those soldiers would have been more useful to them as Titans than as fodder right? Maybe there is something I’m missing as I don’t read the manga and this power hasn’t been fleshed out in the anime. Anyways, this leads me to think along the lines of some of the theories I’ve seen: Could Zeke be working with Paradis now? Doesn’t seem like he died when Levi demolished him from behind based on the fact that we didn’t see his physical death, and Eren had the baseball glove with his letters which seemed like a nod to Zeke.

B) Eldian Empire Jaegerists: Liberate all Eldians and fight back against Marley and the rest of the world.  Activate the Rumbling! Kill all our enemies!  Floch and a bunch of nameless characters.  It also includes Eren... unless Eren is lying to the Jaegerists.

C) Paradis Military Old Guard:  We just want to defend Paradis and not start a World War. This is where most of our old characters are still found: Hange, Mikasa, Jean, Levi, Pryxis. Is Armin still here?

D) Marleyian Warriors: Fighting for Marley against those island devils.  Take the Founding Titan for the glory of Marley and their cool natural resources too.  Commander Maggath.  Galliard, Probably still Reiner. I'm putting Pieck in here even though she described her motives a little differently, but she's still fighting for Marley. That guy Yelena shot in the head.

People badmouthing Mappa really need a reality check. I never cared much for Sasha until this season, she had her moments before but all of them kinda felt hollow to me. But this season... damn, her synergy (even though it was only a couple of scenes) with Connie and Jean, her badassery as a sniper and her less histrionic characterization really made me like her character a lot more than the previous 3 seasons. Making her death super impactful, especially for the way the characters around her react. Armin and especially Mikasa (whom I really didn't like in earlier seasons) reacting to her death without us hearing their voices makes the whole moment so much more poignant and memorable. It also reminds you that these characters have really been through a hell of a lot together and the 4 years that have passed were spent in each other's company. The fact that Sasha dies without giving us a anime speech to her friends makes the whole scene feel so much more brutal and real.

What would have happened had Eren not attacked was basically the entire rest of the world declaring war on the Island and then going and attacking. A **lot** more people would have died in that war. Most certainly Sasha. 

His attack, with their assistance, got them the Warhammer powers, Zeke, they destroyed Marleys port, caused the death of Tybur and other high ranked Marleyans and they beat up all their Titan warriors. A first attack that cost 8 lives, gave them a key to overall victory and set their opponent back BIG. 

What I'm left wondering is what's the end game? What's going on with the important person who met with Tybur then left and him knowing he was going to die? Story wise it seems likely Eren will unleash the ""Rumbling"" aka turn the walls back into Titans who then run over the world killing everything. But is that the end? Does the series end with our main character and the ""good guys"" we rooted for killing everyone else on Earth in order to win? I'm not saying I'm against that, creatively it's powerful and gutsy.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SirUlrichVonLichten,"- God damn, I really thought Pieck had switch sides.

- Armin's reaction to the Euthanization plan....was strange. I thought there would be more pushback on the plan. I mean the plan is really fucked up. They want to wipe out an entire race. And I know they are doing it because they believe it's the only way to stop the Eldian Suffering, but still. Will be interesting to see what the other characters think. Jean was the only one that showed any kind of push back to the idea. 


- I still don't believe that Eren is all in on Zeke's plan. I like that Jean even brought up the idea that Eren was faking all that shit. I'm gonna hold on to this. I got to! No way after everything our boy Eren hates Mikasa and Armin. No way he's really on Zeke's side. I gotta believe he wants to fuck Zeke over. I also like the idea that Armin was pretending to be emotional over the plan. 


- What. A. Cliffhanger.


- Thank god we are getting a part 2 and not a movie.


- It's going to be so hard to stay anime-only, but I got to do it. I've made it this far. Reading the manga now would feel like a betrayal. But mannnnn, I really want to.


- Overall, this season fucking incredible and cemented Attack on Titan as one of my favorite works of fiction. The wait for Part 2 is going to be brutal.",gsmq7i9,mf43si,attackontitan,2021-03-29 01:24:12,53,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

* I  long held onto the theory that Zeke was playing the Long Con and was on  Paradis Island's side. Looks like it was true! I'm fascinated to know  more of Zeke's story and why his allegiance is the way it is.
* Banter between Zeke and Levi was perfect.
* I'm  absolutely gutted about Sasha. The moment Gabi made it onto the  aircraft, I knew someone important was going to bite it. I thought it  was going to be Jean. Everyone's reaction to her death was  heartbreaking, but especially Eren since he knows it's his fault.

* Well  the conversation between Eren, Armin, and Mikasa was so heartbreaking  and tough to watch. Just all the things Eren was saying to each of them.  So cold. Part of me wonders if he really meant, or if there is some  other long con going on here? Or at the very least it was harder for him  to say then he let on. But to be honest, it didn't seem that hard.  Eren....he's just completely gone now. I love his transformation, but  god damn is it heartbreaking.
* I loved seeing Armin fight back though.
* ""We've never fought before have we? It's because it's not even a close fight!"" What a brutal moment.
* Levi  being forced to take out all his comrades. so brutal...yet still  badass. Levi is now 3-0 against Zeke. Even if the second fight was  staged. Something about watching Levi beat the shit out of Zeke.
* The  scene where the Jaegerists force the cadets to beat up the old Scout  trainer. Is there a better scene that encapsulates how far and how  different AoT is now? Back in season one, things were so much more  innocent(relatively speaking). Something like that would never have  happened back then. It was a great way to show how far gone things are. I  just love how this show constantly makes you re-examine the way things  use to be.
* So  glad we learned more about Zeke's backstory and his motivations. And  now we've gotten a bigger picture into what Zeke and Eren are planning.  Holy shit man.",grr3moh,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-22 00:13:29,86,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

The cute photos that the Panzer Unit had of Pieck and the team in their little section on the Cart Titan’s armour. Little nigh inconspicuous Details like that really hammer in the loss of humanity. 

When Falco was trying to save Piëck she told him to leave her and save herself. It’s kind of funny and ironic how arguably the most kind hearted and (IMO) the prettiest and most genteel warrior has the creepiest looking Titan. 

The general looks of relief and admiration the soldiers had when they saw the Beast Titan enter the battlefield. Despite being Eldian, the warriors (especially Zeke) actually commanded a fair amount of respect from the Marleyan military. 

I’m drawing a lot of parallels between Pieck and Armin. In terms of tactical planning and leadership skills.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,honneypot,"My thoughts on this episode:

\-So much has probably happened to them during this time skip

\-Sasha and Armin look so different like the life was sucked out of them, Sasha looks so much more mature 

\-Jean seems to be the same but matured as well, when he hesitated shooting Pieck because of Falco, that reminded me of when he hesitated shooting that person as Eren was being kidnapped and Armin saved him. Pieck now got to live because he hesitated

\-It was so sad seeing Pieck's squad get shot, it's not often you get to see both sides of a war 

\-Zeke was defo acting super suspicious in this episode, "" we are running out of time Levi"" ... and Levi with the clock, mans just stood there and let himself get shot down easily by Levi... very suspicious indeed..

\-Porco was seriously underestimating the scouts... it is crazy how Marley easily won the war against that nation using the power of the titans. But, for Paradis, the only enemy they fought is Titans, all their life,  that's all they've known. So, it isn't surprising to see that they are so advanced fighting titans compared to Marley 

\-a lot of people commented on the soundtrack and how it was ""lacking"" but I personally found it fine, it was fitting and appropriate. The anime is a completely different vibe from the first 3 seasons so the soundtrack is not going to be the same.",gkncidg,l42oc2,attackontitan,2021-01-25 00:27:47,4,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Marleyans keep calling Eldians from paradis island demons but they fail to see that THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MADE THEM THE WAY THEY ARE.

It's even more satisfying this time around since Mikasa catches Porco in titan form by surprise, highlighting the fact that just like Titans were a terrifying beast in the first few seasons, now it's the Paradis Eldians who are picking apart the Marleyans with the same ease. 

Other parallels to draw between these two scenes is how they pay an uncomfortable amount of attention to Armin and Eren slipping inside the titan's mouth in S1 and Lara Tybur's remains falling into Eren's mouth in this most recent episode.",gkpkty3,l42oc2,attackontitan,2021-01-25 15:36:59,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Some thoughts

1. Eren - Porco - Lara scene was just brutal and satisfying at the same time. Am I wrong to think this way? But I just don’t love the scene, I love how Eren grew from being crybaby to a full-grown titan. He’s well-trained now, and he’s come prepared.
2. Armin’s eyes when he saw the massive count of dead bodies on his weight. They’re full of regret. Armin is still our old Armin but more badass.
3. Sasha’s scenes are always short but they’re always FIRE. Such a long-range shooter!
4. I believe in Ackerman Supremacy only. Levi and Mikasa. Oh man. No words.
5. Zeke. I gotta tell you there’s more going on with Zeke, Levi, Paradis Island. His “death” was shown too quickly I’m not sure he was killed or he just disappeared. Looks to me as if he’s having an escape plan with Levi. I don’t know it’s just me but let’s find out. 
6. “Don’t die. Survive til the end.” My sweet Levi.
7. The whole scout I am so happy they’ve grown, they’re well-equipped, they know what they’re doing. Rooting for them always.

There was also that wiretap scene in a previous episode when he said something and that he wouldn't want to discuss it ""in this room"". What does he have to hide from the Marleyan officers?

And that line he said. The subbed version I watched translated it as ""Eren is no match for me"" but I'm fairly sure he said something along the lines of ""エレンは俺の的じゃない"" which could also be taken to mean ""Eren is not my enemy"".... Maybe he was just saying that he was looking to defeat Levi instead, but idk it just seemed a bit off to me... especially considering everything else I've noticed so far.

Then again, what possible motive could he have for aiding the people of Paradis Island? It's very likely that I'm looking too much into it, but I guess it's just something to think about.

Due to trauma and two sided propaganda dude just believes erasing Eldians by preventing them from reproducing will solve the problem of Eldians. Well that’s good and all that but here’s my personal feelings. 

That’s a LAZY solution to such a problem. Just like we **don’t** say “let’s kill every women because they will be eventually sexually assaulted at some point in their lives and killing them while they are babies will save them from that pain.” Or just like when we **dont** say “We should kill all the black people because they are suffering unimaginable amounts of racism and only killing them will stop it”. We also shouldn’t be okay with “Let’s kill Eldian race by murdering their mojo”. Because that’s not a solution at all. In contrary this kind of a goal is working in favor of powers which are currently causing the suffering of Eldians. There is a cause and effect here.

Well I've got another theory that may be supported by those other theories.

What is it? Well if Zeke really isn't dead and it's working with the scouts he may also get eaten by Eren, how?!, Well think back to the baseball glove scene, it has nothing to do with Zeke, the beast titan is best known for its throwing abilities so Eren having a baseball and a glove means he's trying to get better at throwing and in case he does eat Zeke he won't have to learn how to throw in case the time comes where he needs to use the beat titan. 

Why would Zeke want to get eaten? He has a year left is he is really betraying Marley he has to get eaten by someone from paradis and why not by his own brother?  its perfect foreshadowing!

As far as I remember, we didn't actually see him kill anyone the whole episode - he threw some rocks, but nobody actually died. He didn't even really try to fight Eren. I'm pretty sure Levi didn't kill him, he was extracting him to get him on the zeppelin.

It seems they never acknowledge , strategize for, or identify the Attack titan or his owner. 
Was he always in the hands of the Eldian rebels? How has he remained hidden?(the Owl left no witnesses, and they know ""now"" due to Reiner). 

A scenario comes to mind...

Two Marleyan generals sitting in an office listening to Willy's speech...

Gen1: ""Willy talking 'bout the old days"" 

Gen2: ""Speaking of the old days, remember that Attack titan dude""

Gen1: ""Oh yeah, what ever happened to that guy?""

Gen2: ""Last I heard he was down in Tampa with a wife and two kids""...""Running a lumber business, don't even need a chainsaw, pulling the trees right out of the ground... Can you believe that shit!

1) Marley government knew something- they had a very strong and alert military standing by for a play/announcement on their own soil...

2) Pieck/Cart might have told the panzers unit ""follow us"" or ""check on us"".
The panzer guy was ""shocked"" a little more than just getting a hug from a sexy heroine...(in the next week's trailer we see Cart and Jaw standing on the street as opposed to  the grass floor of dungeon)- Panzer tossed down a rope i'm thinking.

3) In the beginning, Annie and Bert were discussing the old man wanting to be judged, then they cut to Reiner who wanted Eren to judge him...just an observation..

4) Asian lady IMO, Ackerman, She had an A on her back and says ""clan"" to Willy, previous cut info bump stated Levi, Mikasa, and Kenny are all Ackerman with ""related ?"" and states: they can call on inner power/rage and can't be brainwashed.

5) I'm going with Arimin for the guard, Zeke was too relaxed through the whole ordeal and told deliberately by guard to go somewhere else, with no question or suspicion by Zeke. Is he that laid back? He definitely in the know IMO..

6) Willy trying to get countries to help do what Marley couldn't.
Remember, they tried to kidnap the founding Titan when it was still in Royal peace-keeping possession, so yeah he left that out.

Funny to me: Eren: ""it's cool Reiner, you were a brainwashed child following orders"". Reiner: ""Yeah, but i kind went out my way to get thousands of innocent people killed and your mom too""...",gixg8hk,kuhrxr,attackontitan,2021-01-11 22:27:31,9,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,that80skid,"I’ve been rewatching this episode and especially that ending scene. Two take always.

1) Eren is still emotional or at least driven by the emotions of his younger self. We makes Reiner admit that he killed his mom and attacked them. And the way Eren throws it all right back into his face. Even the last words Eren uses are personal between him and Reiner. “I’ll keeping moving forward. Until I destroy all my enemies.” Make no mistake Eren internally is still emotional, he’s just not expressing those emotions the same way.

2) It’s terrifying how deadpanned / unemotional Eren is about the whole exchange with Reiner is. He comes off as cold and detached yet he’s discussing personal things with Reiner. Also was he clenching his fist so hard out of anger that made him bleed? He says he vaguely forgot about it threatening to kill Reiner and his people. I don’t believe he did forget about it. I think he understands how complicated it all is. He seems to have made up his mind and come to terms with his situation. Where as Reiner doesn’t (yet?) have that resolve. Reiner still has some compassion and sympathy. I can’t say the same (yet?) for Eren.

MAPPA continues to kill it with the production of these episodes. My favorite episodes so far.

I think one of the biggest tells of Eren's speech is how in S1 or 2 Mikasa talks about how she used to ignore the cruelty of the world, where she's with her mum in the garden and an insect is devouring another one, and where Eren saves her from the kidnappers and convinces her she has to fight or die. You think it's just a heartwarming story of survival up until this episode.

Then you realise it's not just a defensive thing, that whole mindset prepared them for this point where they needed to do the evil deed for survival. If they just said to Reiner ""I forgive you this war will end"" but with the speech everyone in the world would have taken the side of the speaker and agreed to invade Paradis so it's inevitable.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,KingBowser64,"So far I haven’t seen anyone mention the conversation with Annie’s father. He seems determined that Annie is alive still. Annie was literally around up until the end of season 1. We now only get her through flashbacks. 
That scene just sat...odd with me. I am curious if it is bait for the audience to believe that Annie will be coming back, but in reality, she’s dead. I doubt she’d be willing to be helpful (her personality) if she came out of the crystal, so I feel like maybe Eren ate her in the crystal... I don’t know, but that scene just felt strange and like bait.

Also, in the teaser for next week: Udo is “helping” someone on his right that was smashed by a rock. The two people on his right (from where they were sitting for the performance): Gabi (middle) and Zophia (furthest to the right)
Either Gabi and/or Zophia got destroyed by a boulder. I originally thought that it was Zophia that was smashed. It would make sense because Zophia is less important than Gabi and she is sort of a background character, but that’s why I think that Gabi was killed instead. Gabi is hyped up to be the best, which is why she is thought to be the next Armored Titan. The Armored Titan is supposed to be either Gabi or Falco. Falco wants to save his love interest Gabi, so he wants to become the Armored Titan. What if Gabi is killed by the “evil island devil” Eren? That would cause a fire of hatred to explode within Falco (whom was shown to be questioning the motives in that one train scene with Reiner) towards the people of Paradise. Falco would get the Armored Titan and would be full of hate and anger. I feel like it would be more boring and “expected” for Zophia to die, so that is precisely why I feel it is Gabi that was at least crushed. 

Tldr; My guesses from this episode after watching it twice and pausing way too many times: Annie is dead. Eren ate Annie. Gabi was crushed by a boulder. Falco will become the Armored Titan and will hate all people of Paradise.

If the Tybur family already knew that the King wanted to remain peaceful, then what reason did they have for doing any of this?  I could maybe see how the reason for attacking wall Maria was an effort to stop Grisha Yeager's mission to take the Founding Titan, but even that seems unlikely given that its unlikely that Marley would know of Grisha's plan, and it has been stated that Marley attacked Wall Maria to lure out the King.

In the end Eren saying he and Reiner were the same wasn't him putting aside their differences so they could work together, it was just him saying that he understood why he did it now and accepted that he's no better than him. I was really hoping that Eren and Reiner would convince everyone that the people on the island weren't the devils they'd been taught they were, of course that would have been more underwhelming because there would have been a lot less action but idk, I was really just hoping for a happy ending because there are characters that I like on both side of the conflict and the whole thing has just been caused by false information, if everyone could take the time to understand each other they'd realize there's no need to fight at all, its just tragic that so many people are going to die over basically a misunderstanding. Everyone in this show has been through so much and it'd be nice for things to start looking up in the end but now I cant see how it could end without one side being completely eradicated. Also, even though Reiner feels incredibly guilty, I still cant see him choosing to fight against Marley, where his own family is, if it comes down to either destroying Marley or Paradis, so it's unlikely I'll see Eren and Reiner team up like I was hoping for. It's getting hard for me to root for anyone in this show at this point, I still really like the characters and understand their motivations but i still just cant root for someone who's goal is to wipe out entire nations of people.

I genuinely felt so so bad for him because I never truly believed he was evil to begin with, I was just waiting for the story to reveal his actual ideals so I had sympathy for Zeke yet I also obviously understood Levi‘s standpoint. 

The further this season progresses the more I feel detached from our scouts and closer to Eren and Zeke. I trust in Eren and I think people really don’t give him enough credit this man is smarter than y’all think he knows d has experienced things beyond anybody’s imagination. Hanji and Armin on the other hand just can’t let go of their morals and beliefs and hopes for some kind of change in the greater scheme of things. Hoping everyone can become friends again but in that they are limiting themselves and causing more damage in the long run. 

They simply are not ready to make the sacrifices that Eren is preparing himself to make in order to end this cycle and progress. 

I do feel bad for them because Eren is not giving them any answers or hints that he still is the same person they grew up with. 

Anyway I don’t know how Eren is going to solve all of this because I really hope he is not going to kill off all Eldians but find some kind of loop hole to make everyone survive in sone shape or form.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,I_am_Feli,"My theory:

Willy Tybur or SOMEONE within the Tybur family is working with Eren and they planned out to have this whole speech and everything to make him look like the bad guy, for the Marleans (and the rest of the world) to understand and FEEL what the Eldians on Paradis had to go trough, so that with the help of the Kiyomi (forgot her last name, the japanese woman) they can break the cycle so to speak and end the ongoing war and back and forth between the Eldians and everyone else, the Marleans specially.

Remember, the asians (or just japanese, not sure) and the Ackermanns can not be controlled by the founding Titan. King Fritz was not able to brainwash them. They KNOW something!

The story Willy Tybur told everyone today, is NOT the FULL truth! There is still something hidden within the whole Royal Family meaning BOTH Tyburs and King Fritz! 

It looks like Kiyomi is on Willy Tyburs side and the Tyburs are against Eren but I think all 3 are working together! They ALL know there is a key part missing that was not told to the public.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IustinKing,"Disclaimer: I didn't read any manga, so everything I think will happen is all from my little imagination.

SO, where do we start:

\-The moment Eren transforms: EPIC. What can I say? When I saw yellow particles I said in my mind: ""This is gonna be AWESOME!"". I think Eren's eye in close up must be some kind of message. Why did his eye shine blue? Is there any meaning behind it? We will see in future episodes I guess  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

\-The Jaw Titan and the Cart Titan got ""captured""(more trapped I guess). This event isn't ***THAT*** important, but the thing that got me fired up is Armin. Like, dude, is Armin. And not any Armin...... Colosal Titan Armin, after 4 years of having it's power. And btw, nice beard he got there! D:

\-Zeke. What the hell is Zeke doing? Eren planned the attack (probably), and trapped Falco and Pieck, BUT what about Zeke? I know he is more of a ""long range"" Titan, by using his powerfull throws, but for real, where is he, and what will he do about an Angry Eren killing hundreds of people? 

\-One more thing about Eren. I'm surprized how much he ""evolved"". Like you could see that he mastered controlling his super fast regeneration and he got wiser. I say this because, he didn't do anything stupid. I mean, old Eren ( like season 3 Eren) would have just punched Reiner to death in that underground room. Instead, season 4 Eren had a *conversation* with him. That line:  ""I just keep moving forward""  , was just GENIUS.

That's pretty much it about what i wanted to say about this episode.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,kollarb,"So after rewatching all the tall soldier scenes and pausing on the frame that shows his face, I was thinking who the hell that might be. I think I got it. 

I want to state that I am an anime watcher only, I know nothing about the manga, I wouldn’t act as I know nothing for some internet points, I just want to talk about my theory. But if it’s correct then this could be a major plot point and it could ruin the surprise. So please stop reading if you want to go in blind. Maybe I am wrong, but now that I think about it, it’s quite obvious.

So I think the soldier is indeed Armin... and Annie.
The soldier is very tall so if we assume that a shifter phisically changes if they acquire a titan then that would explain that it is Armin because he ate Bertholt and grew in size.
Also Armin has blonde hair, the shape of the face is kinda similar, the voice is weird but it could have gotten deeper over 4 years.

So why do I think it isn’t that simple?
Two things: Pieck recognized him, and the shot where we see his face. Also kinda the fake beard, but maybe he can’t grow one, big deal.

The biggest clue for me are the long eyelashes. They are VERY feminine. That’s when I suspected Annie but all the other factors are pointing towards Armin.

So I think Armin ate Annie and got the Female titan from her. It would explain everything. That’s why he has these feminine eyes, that’s why he can’t grow a beard and that’s why Pieck recognized him (Pieck only saw Armin as a burnt body).

I really don’t know why Armin would eat Annie if he already possesses the Colossal but I guess we will find out.

What do you guys think? I think this is the only explanation right now, it just adds up.",giuc9zt,kuhrxr,attackontitan,2021-01-11 05:47:58,0,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,multisofteis,"What a perfect episode! 

I thought about the Tybur family doing a propaganda play to further make it seem like the paradies island eldians are the enemies since there was a scene in the trailer with Willy bowing down on a stage and in early S4 someone saying to contact Willy for smth.

Eren and Rainer's exposition had me sitting there with goosebumps! It was an absolute hell of a rollercoaster ride to see how Rainer just breaks down in front of him. I'm wondering what happens to Rainer. Will he switch sides, as he wanted to kill himself already because his only friends, paradies eldians, were gone (at that moment in time) and the only friends he had are all dead or missing except for Zeke and the other shifters and his family. Or is he just going to die/be a pawn in Armin's plan for what happens after.

So the next episode will be about the fight with the Warhammer Titan and Eren but maybe the other scouts will finally reveal themselves, but what's Marley's answer going to be as they kinda seemed like they knew at least something.",giututs,kuhrxr,attackontitan,2021-01-11 09:15:09,1,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Edit: actually i am not sure who to side with now that i thought about it again. I mean Eldian was at fault from the very start and for 700 years have been fucking Marley until they exploited it and gave them what they deserve and now they try acting all innocent and a coward part of them escaped or ended the war like king fritz who was soo good and kind didn't do shit these 700 years and when they started losing he is like nah i aint about these wars. I change my mind I am siding with Marley empire however I don't agree with them colonize other Empire's like Slava but that's how the world works.

Another edit: why did Ymir make a deal with the devil in the first place i misunderstood and thought it was because marley was colonizing them if thats the cause then i would be on eldian's side though its unfair and sinful however its not their fault its ymir's fault. They just happened to get the power it's not like they agreed and i guess that would be a great sacrifice of her but not acceptable.

Another edit: let me get this stright eren's missions was suppost to be him colonizing marley avenging eldians that are enslaved by marley but eren considers eldian his hometown so he will take revenge on both marley and eldins because those enslaved eldians hate the eldian empire anyways and thought the eldian empire betrayed them therfor they marley attacks eldian empire using eldians they slave like reiner ,bertold and annie EVEN FUCKING THOUGH GRISHA'S PLAN IS TO FREE THE SLAVED ELDIANS BECAUSE HE WAS A SLAVED ELDIAN BUT EREN IS NOT FROM THE SLAVED ELDIANS AHHHHHHHHHHHHH i mean it's the fathers fault for not teaching him who is his real town

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sonofjupiteralt,"NO MANGA SPOILERS, Only Explanation  
So in order to avoid any confusion regarding the time travel mechanics, I will break down what type of Time travel we're dealing with here.  
  
AOT operates by a particular type of time travel where it's almost impossible to change the past even if you somehow go back in time. And any change that you tried to cause was always meant to happen in the overall timeline. Here time is a fixed circle, not a stream. We may see Eren meddle in the past but that was always meant to happen.  
  
The Attack Titan's ability is to receive the memories of its future inheritors. This was hinted when Kruger mentioned Mikasa and Armin towards the end of S3. Keep in mind, they can only view these memories but can't interact with them. So how was Eren able to meddle in the past?  
  
Well, he had 3 perfect conditions:  
  
⁠He had the ability of the Attack Titan  
  
⁠The ability of the Founding Titan  
  
⁠He was also in contact with someone with royal blood AKA Zeke.  
  
After Zeke tapped Eren's head, they were able to view Grisha's past memories with Eren using the power of the coordinate. They were freely able to view the past as if it were through a one way mirror.  
  
Now if Eren had any other Titan other than the Attack Titan, he would only be able to look. But since Attack Titan can see forward in time, Grisha can use this to see Eren's recollection of the same event that he's currently experiencing in real time.  
  
So this mean that whenever Grisha can see or hear Eren, he's actually recieving a brief future memory from Eren's POV where he can see out of his eyes and hear his words. That means he is seeing himself from a 3rd perspective. Then if he responds, his response is simply part of the memory that Eren/Zeke are viewing, allowing for a two way communication through time.  
  
Also Note that everytime, Grisha sees Zeke, Eren is always standing behind his dad. So whenever Grisha sees Zeke, it is from actually due to the memories from Eren's POV  
  
Another thing to add:  
  
Eren did NOT see everything in the future. Eren only saw CRUCIAL moments in the future, for example, he saw Pieck pointing a gun at him when he kissed Historia’s hand 4 years ago, this is why he was so calm when she threatened to shoot him, because Eren KNEW she wouldn’t shoot him. However, Eren DIDN’T know that Porco was going to try to eat him just a couple of minutes later. Even Eren doesn’t know EVERYTHING that will happen",huxjeyg,sga0gi,attackontitan,2022-01-31 02:04:28,102,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,SuperSpread,"Just want to repost this for everyone: the Attack Titan power is NOT the power to see the future. It is the power to receive chosen future memories - i.e. the power to send memories back in time to itself. Even the Owl got memories of Armin and Mikasa and immediately said out loud he had no clue why he was being given the memory but was just blindly passing it on to Grisha.

Past Eren had no power to select future memories to see. Future Eren selected every memory for past Eren to see as well as when he would see them - including when he saw the royal family massacre in season 3 after kissing Historia's hand. See his reaction. This is when Eren knew he was actually the one responsible for killing them

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,jusaturt,"That was incredible. My brain still hasn't fully been able to grasp the implications of everything happening in this show, but this storytelling is really on another level in so many ways. I'm also high right now so this is gonna be rambly.

Where to start? My first time through the episode felt like being wacked over the head with so many plot revelations, moments of emotion, disgust and amazement that it was difficult to absorb. Immediately after it ended, I rewinded and watched the episode again. I'm about to rewatch it once more once I get some thoughts out.

There's so much complexity in this story, with so many different themes, narrative reframings, character motivations, and now time travel rules (which I'll touch more on later) that it's kind of mind-blowing how much.. plot, has been packed into these 80 episodes. But what's so fucking nuts about it all is that it's remained incredibly consistent. Attack on Titan has always felt like Attack on Titan, despite the fact that Attack on Titan feels like a thousand different things in one show. There's a scale and a depth to this thing that trump's anything else I've read, watched or played. The clashing ideologies are so interesting. The constant plot twists NEVER feel cheap, despite the fact that on paper it seems like they should. That's what impresses me most about this show.

I also am really growing to appreciate that Attack on Titan does not hold the hand of the viewer. It presents this story to you, and allows you to make sense of it all, in both the morals of its characters, and also it's internal logic (specifically the time travel rules and the powers of the titans.) My first time through the episode, I didn't realize that Grisha can't physically see Eren. I had to piece together for myself with a rewatch that when Eren kisses Historia's hand, he is seeing Grisha's memories of Future Eren, and that Grisha is seeing Eren's memories of watching him in the paths. Piecing that together for myself makes it feel so much more earned and rewarding than if the show had just outright explained it to me in an exposition dump. And even though I didn't quite get that on my first watch, it in no way hampered the experience. My disgust at Eren, Grisha's mental breakdown, Zeke and Grisha meeting again... It was a rollercoaster of emotions only made possible by careful buildup.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,JakeXXII,"So I see a lot of confusion around the Attack Titan power and Eren ""changing"" the past. 

The Attack Titan allows its users to glimpse memories of future inheritors of the Titan. This allows them to see the future through the future host's pov. The Attack Titan power alone didn't allow Eren to ""change"" the past. It is because Eren also possesses the Founding Titan that he was able to do so. 

When he kissed Historia's hand, he made contact with royal blood allowing him to use the founder's powers and likely took him to the Coordinate where he could have spent as much time as he wanted studying the future. It showed Eren his father's pov of his memory of killing the royal family. Although they didn't show it in S3, Eren would have also seen future him reminding his father why he was there and urging him to kill them. (Except the father because the father needed to stay alive in order for the Historia plot to happen and allow Eren to kiss her and thus set this whole thing into motion) 

Present day Eren was only ""there"" because Zeke was using the founder's powers to visit their father's memories. Without the founder, the attack titan power does not allow physically revisiting past memories. Eren knew he'd end up there if he just followed the path however thanks to his Titans powers. 

Now for the trippy Inception like part. From Grisha's point of view, he is alone with the Greiss family in that secret hideout. At that point, as shown in the episode, he has already seen some of future Eren's memories. Normally, he'd experience these visions through Eren's eyes just like every other Titan shifter when they glimpse their Titan's memories. This is where the Attack Titan's power comes into play. Whenever Eren is physically present in one of Grisha's memories, it creates a feedback loop where Grisha is then able to see future Eren's memory of that very moment in his own memories through Eren's eyes. He doesn't see Eren standing beside him in the hideout or in any other memory, he sees himself through future Eren's eyes. 

He is able to see Zeke though because Eren is looking at him in the future and thus he is able to see him through that memory

People are saying that Eren has been playing everyone since the beginning but I dont think that's accurate. Up until the moment he made contact with historia, he was ""normal"" Eren and had no notion of the things he'd later do/has already done (Unless he also went to the Coordinate when he touched Titan Dina in S2 but they didn't show it). I think it is more accurate to say that Future Eren (post Historia kiss) has been the one orchestrating everything since the start, possibly even his own birth.

I also don't think it's fair to say that Eren brainwashed Grisha. We saw all throughout the memories, Grisha acting of his own accord without Eren's influence.

That essentially makes the attack Titan the most powerful Titan overall since they get to see into the future. I wonder who eren sees in the future??? But at the same time maybe it ends with eren? Maybe everything has been built up to end with eren and that’s why even all the way during the owl time he got memories from eren yet we haven’t gotten any hints of eren getting memories from his child or future inherenter. And if you think about it the first episode was called to you 2000 years from now and the next one is from you 2000 years ago. So I definitely think it ends with eren or there’s just some significance to erens possession of the attack Titan. Also though how the hell will eren regenerate his head is he just dead…? Zeke was still barely alive when he blew himself up so when the Titan swallowed him he was able to regenerate even more and heal. But like eren literally got his head BLOWN CLEAN OFF.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,fearlix2,"Ok so I'm seeing a lot of confusion over this episode which is understandable for anime onlies. Manga readers had a month to make theories and analyze the story between each chapter which is roughly equal to every half episode.
So I'm going to try my best to explain stuff.
First off, something u should keep in mind is that not everything that comes out of the character's mouths is the truth. Case in point is grisha's explanation of the attack titan's power. He explained that the attack titan's ability allows it's inheritors to see the memories of future inheritors which is technically true but not the whole thing.
Let me explain. All the nine titans including the attack titan have the ability to see the memories of past inheritors ( porco seeing ymir's memories, Armin seeing bertholdt's etc) but only the attack titan has the ability to not only see memories from past inheritors but also send their own memories to past inheritors. So essentially what grisha said was true, he can see erens memories but he cant choose which ones to see because the memories he is seeing are being handpicked and sent back by eren and so by only sending specific memories back to his father he essentially manipulates and forces him to act as he wishes.
Something else to keep in Mind is that eren was actually unaware of the mechanics of this ability until right before the intro plays in the episode.
The first time we see the attack titan's power in action is when grisha notices future Zeke for the first time in the basement. If u pay attention in the episode grisha mentions Zeke's name before even seeing him just as he wakes up and he only does so when eren focuses on a picture of Zeke. So eren unconsciously sent back a memory of Zeke to his father when he noticed the picture and upon realizing how the power worked began essentially drip feeding grisha memories to guide him in the direction of the main timeline.
 It's a closed loop. Eren sends back memories, therefore grisha takes the founding and passes it to eren so 8 years later eren can use a combo of founding and attack powers to drip feed memories to his father and it all starts all over again.
And as for how eren knows the future despite not getting any info from inheritors after him, well it's ... Weird. Basically the idea is that if u see someone else's memory of something then that person's memory will become a part of your memories. When future eren sent his own memories to grisha they became part of grisha's memories which allowed grisha to become a sort of link between past and future eren. four years ago eren kissed historias hand and was able to see his father's memories and in his father's memories he found his own memories of the future. And that's how he knows his own future.
I think that about covers almost everything. Do ask if u need clarification on anything else.",hv9jr6c,sga0gi,attackontitan,2022-02-02 12:50:50,6,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

To me, it seemed he had reservations about what he knew he was going to do. It also appeared that he was testing the future that he saw. ""perfect timing"", when the rest of the people found him talking to Mikasa I think implies that theory. As well as him attending the announcement for the Subjects of Ymir foundation, he wanted to believe that it would go a different way. When he saw that it wouldn't, he left and began the plan.  
  
Great to see Historia again. I imagined we'd see what's been going on in that neck of the woods, but I have been waiting for it. Interesting that Eren told her his plans. Could he have even changed her mind with the founding titan considering she has noble blood? If he couldn't, does that mean she's going along with his plan, or at least keeping quiet about it? I wont even get into whether or not he's the one that put a bun in the oven.  
  
I loved the conversation with Zeke. Eren actually had a true brotherly conversation. Eren truly could not fathom the idea that Mikasa may love him to such an extreme degree that he came up with the theory of an Ackerman protecting their ""host"". Cool to see the origin of that and further proves that he was trying to push her away so that she could go on without him.  
  
Okay, the last 5 minutes of the episode. Holy. SHIT. I don't know what's more gruesome, what Eren did to himself in the paths, or what he did to himself in the trenches. No matter his choices, that is some damn conviction right there. The swimming titans was sort of hilarious and equally terrifying. The Navy getting burnt from the steam was brutal and badass and awful all at the same time. Then the final shot of Eren behind the titan army, holy shit. I'd try to give myself the Reiner special if I saw that thing coming towards me.

Zeke even told him flat out that Mikasa was in love with him and he still didn’t waver. His role as the protagonist is one of the most fascinating I’ve ever seen because the line is so heavily blurred at this point but at the very least, we know he cares more about the people close to him than anything else on the planet and will take any measures to see them safe.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,TheRealWipper,"(Anime only here) So it's what I've been thinking for a bit but this basically confirms it. Eren must have feelings for Mikasa as she does for him as well. Although he isn't sure she cares for him in any other way than family and after she gave that answer it was some kind of click in his brain that there's nothing left? But then we see him after with Zeke possibly trying to convince himself or find some reason that she doesn't care in a way he wants her too, but then says he ""only has 4 years left anyways."" Again just seems like he's trying to act like he doesn't care at all or something to that point. Then everything with Historia and the different points of view from everyone he talked with to set this plan into motion was spectacular. He was playing so many different sides and we got see throughly see his thought process finally. Such a sad and brutal episode that makes me feel horrible for Eren and everyone else. He's going through so much pain, and was even before they went across the ocean. He now thinks this is the only possible way to save everyone and save the people of Paradis. And you feel his anger when they rise from the ocean and it's a complete parallel to the start of AOT when the people in the walls were attacked and now they are facing that same horror while Eren feels that exact same rage he did when watching his mother get eaten.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,neekogasm,I have been annoyed that this whole time we have not gotten a concrete answer on why eren is doing what hes doing. But his conversation with historia revealed that he believes that he can stop the cycle of hatred by ending civilization itself. Also in the extended conversation with Zeke in Liberio he talks about wanting his friends to live a happy life. It also seems like hearing the chants during the forum in Liberio cemented his thoughts on the matter. I still believe that Eren should have at the very least tried to have peace talks before immediately resorting to the massacre in Marley. It seems in that moment he was fueled with a lot of resentment. I think in his head he may think he is doing the right thing but he is ultimately fueled by vengeance and hatred himself,i39yjg7,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-04 00:01:28,4,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

2. What happened to Zeke? Hes shown as chained essentially in Ymir's ethereal plane, but did Eren eat him officially? Is he dead?
3. When will it explain where pure titans originated from? I'm assuming either at some point in the last 2,000 years someone had a bad idea to try and make new titans from a shifters blood and it being mindless/eats humans is a painful consequence to their arrogance, OR, the spinal fluid thing was already known and the only reason they are mindless/eat humans is because there isn't / wasn't a founding titan to verbally control them. Left unchecked by a founder, they default to mindless / human eating in hopes to find a shifter or the founder as an insurance policy the curse continues.",i6b91bs,tva14t,attackontitan,2022-04-26 22:21:34,2,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,robby8892,"I think narratively this was a horrible season finale as we gain no new information and are mostly left wanting.

The writers also commit to doing maybe the worst example of showing after telling I've ever seen put to tv.

And I truly believe episode 86 is the appropriate finale as it has a wonderful natural conclusion to the season.

Our characters are struggling and they are trying to build unity as a rag tag group that were initially enemies at the start of the season. 

Some are dead and there is an internal struggle to kill Eren to save the world. This was a true way to give us motivation for Part 3 as we already accepted that they are far to late to stop the initial destruction of the rumbling.

We ""killed"" Flock and got the goal set to refuel the air craft and catch up to Eren and his army of Olympic level titan swimmers. (I don't know anywhere that they established that Titans could breathe under water and I can admit I might need more context. It just looked silly) 

The stage is set.......

Point 1

Episode 87: Season Finale - Filler 

Episode 87 is 50% a filler episode in my eyes even if it gives a happy time with the gang it tonally doesn't fit with how we left everyone in the previous episode at such dire straits.

I get fan service, but the show needs to commit to this acceptance of the immoral genocider they created in Eren and stop trying to use characters like Armin and Mikasa to be his staunch defenders to pull him back or justify his cause.

It's not a cute fun loving show. Eren is going to commit global genocide to keep some of his friends alive which seems to make little sense.

Why would he think they wouldn't try to stop him? Flock was going to kill them all, would it not have been prudent to maybe say ""Keep my friends alive"" to Flock the trigger happy loose cannon....

Point 2

The writers want to have their cake and eat it.

The Episode commits to doing something I always known I would hate. They show us scenes of Eren doing things we were already told about in this season and the prior season.

So much so that it almost feels like a waste of time (Filler) as no new information is shared with us in the major plot. We already know Eren has committed to the path and we already know it's for the small reason to save his friends.

Now this would of been a perfect moment to address Sashas death....Seeing how the writers don't care to show us how he feels about her death I'll just assume it'll take up half an episode in Part 3 and not bother...

R.I.P. Sasha...

Point 3 

The writers aren't confident....

I'm 100% sure there is more lore and things to do from the Manga, but it doesn't seem to flowing as well as it could.

I very much feel confident in their decisions to make the character the protagonist they created a genocidal maniac as after a rewatch of the show up to now you can see how he slowly goes further into madness and blood lust over the years.

Truly a bold move and I wish it felt like writers were more confident in this choice. Because for most of the episode we try to play with idea that Eren could have always been like this.

A monster who is lost in his desire for revenge. No longer possible to reach his is a single minded killing machine....

Oh wait no in the previous scene it's so his friends can live happy lives. He has a good heart even though he will genocide the world.

Ultimately I feel like they can't decide what kind of monster Eren is. Is he the revenge machine pushed to the brink.

Or is he a person who would kill the world to save the people he loves. 

Guess we'll know which one fits next year!

Note:

This is very ranty and I respect any disagreement. 

If you wanna discuss I'd be happy to oblige, if you want to argue I'll probably ignore you.

I don't think the show is bad, but I find it's becoming frustrating when the writers can't commit to their decisions.

And I only wrote this because of how shitty I feel we ended the season as opposed to the last season.

Episode 86 is the true Finale. Fom a narrative perspective it's perfectly done.

Annie is broken, and we know the path forward is to save what little bit of humanity is left.

Yet she is done and wants to stop the fighting.

And what would be a perfect ending scene but having Eren making his first attack with the rumbling.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Nervious_Nerve,"The pacing since The Rumbling started was off. I've only watched Attack On Titan on marathon format (I've never liked waiting a week for one episode; it always leaves a sour taste in my mouth). But i was too excited for this season as to wait, so I could be wrong. There's just been too much slow-show-don't-tell conversations with minimal action payoff. I'll have to watch Season 4 Part 2 completely again in one sitting as to validate my opinion on my complaint. ""The Dawn Of Humanity"" was a very poor episode. Even worse as a season finale. I even think it might have been better right after Eren Starts The Rumbling. You get a flashback, exposition about the last time they saw Eren. Then in episode 27, Mikasa on top of the ship heading towards Eren, Reminisces about what she could have said differently. Idk, this was too anticlimactic. The dramatic sequencing of three events: Historia (when was that conversation by the way? I'm genuinely confused), Floch, Zeke and cutting off his leg was emotionally charged, I liked it. It was a bit too on the nose for Eren but I liked it. I am happy though they're making part 3, I wasn't very interested in a movie seeing as it's just rushed content fitted into a 1hr 20 minute movie (anime movies are never long) attack on titan is better on longer run times and big payoffs. I hope the next season is better handled in terms of pacing issues. Seeing as part 2 was honestly the best attack on titan has ever been up to the rumbling. God the emotions behind those episodes is coma inducing. Followed by the slowest-rushed? Arc of the anime's entire lifespan.

But something's really been bothering me as a plot hole, and that's the ability for one person to take on multiple Titan powers at once. If that's possible, then how come neither Annie, Berholdt, nor Reiner ever just chomped down on Eren and took the founder power that way? They repeatedly failed to capture him alive but each one of them had him in their mouth at some point so it makes no sense not to just take his power. 

It's also confusing that it had never happened before in history. If 500 years ago the armor titan ate the cart titan, then those two would always be together since the next person to eat that titan would get both, right?

On this same subject... What the hell happened to the Attack titan? It seems to be implied in this season that Grisha ate the founder and passed on both Attack and Founder to Eren, but in Eren's flashback his father was still alive and Eren just ate the Reiss girl, right? Maybe we'll see more about this in the future but it seems really weird that we don't know at all where the attack titan is or what it can do, especially since Grisha shouldn't be alive any more (assuming the 13 years thing is set in stone). Who has that power now?!?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,curtismannheim,"So here are my speculationis about the future, based on some of the things from this episode and the past events.

&#x200B;

I don't buy that Eren will go along with Zeke's plan, and here are my arguments:

1. Making it so no more Eldians can be born is to give up. Eren does not give up, especially not on the freedom he's been fighting for his whole life.  Just remember season 1, when Armin is trying to get Eren to close the breach in Trost:

Armin: ""Why do we fight? What is the reason that makes us go outside the walls?""

Eren: ""Because this world is our birthright""

Sterilizing the entire nation, in Eren's eyes, would be do deny that birthright, the same thing the titans that he hated his whole life were doing. The same thing the royal family did by erasing Eldians' memories - denied the people's freedom to choose for themselves. Eren always fights for freedom, and urges everyone else to do the same. I don't think I need to remind you how many times he said the word ""fight"" for the  entirety of the show. 

2. In this episode Jean points out that Eren wouldn't hurt Mikasa without a reason (that scene was painful to watch btw). When Mikasa and Armin hear this they have a ""hey, waitaminit, he's got a point, maybe he's onto something"" kinda face. And, of course, before we get any of the characters' thoughts or speculations on this, they get interrupted. 

That is further proof, but from the meta point of view. I think most people know that this is how anime leave the breadcrumbs for us to follow. The same thing happened in season 2 when Reiner caught that Ymir can read Marleyan writings. That scene too, spanned just a couple of seconds, and got immediately interrupted by the titan attack. I believe the same is happening in this episode.

3. At the end of season 3 Eren asks if they would be free if all their enemies on the other side are killed. He says the same in his conversation with Reiner - ""I'll just keep moving forward, untill I've killed my enemies"". And in the previous episode again, when he talks about how Berthold is taking over Armin's mind, he says: ""An enemy within you that is in love with another enemy"". He still referred to Berthold and Annie as enemies. I think you can connect the dots.

In conclusion, based on our knowledge of who Eren is, going with Zeke's plan is completely out of character for him. Whatever his plan is, I don't believe he will do this. But then again, we didn't get Eren's own perspective on all of this in this season practically at all. All we have is other people's accounts and opinions on what he's got in his head. So there is still a possibility that he's changed. HOWEVER, such change would need to be justified hard, and I mean HARD. Literally, I think the only way he'd do this if he got some cosmic vision through his future seeing powers that there is no other way, because that's the only way you get someone as stubborn and driven as eren to break, and eve that is a stretch.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wolfpac187,"This show is elite.

I've been waiting for Eren to sit down and talk with Armin and Mikasa and it didn't disappoint at all. I think there's a possibility that Eren didn't mean what he said to Mikasa and only did it to seperate them from himself, but at the same time he's permanently ruined his relationship with his old friends. And watching poor Armin catch those hands was wild.

Levi is the GOAT but at this point he's made Zeke his bitch. He's bodied Zeke twice and I feel like when they fight for the third time it's gonna be Zeke's turn to get a W, and I don't think he's gonna keep Levi alive sadly. Besides that I was hype to see Zeke finally die.

Floch is trash and is in my top three most hated along with Rod Reiss and that dude that killed Grisha's sister and turned Dina into a Titan (forgot his name).

Yeah I wasn't hype to see Zeke die after ""Sole Salvation"" I don't think I've ever changed my mind about a character so quickly. He's done some of the most horrible shit in the show but at the same time seeing what his parents put him through was honestly disgusting. By the end I was hoping Levi wouldn't kill him.

I don't fully understand Zeke's plan of wiping out Eldians and why Eren is going along with it but maybe he's not and he's just waiting to turn on Zeke. Makes sense considering how happy Zeke was when Eren teamed up with him since Eren is loving breaking peoples hearts lately.

Before these episodes I've predicted that Eren will die by either Mikasa or Levi's hands but now I don't think Mikasa is even capable and I don't see Levi making it that far. I think it'll be Reiner or Gabi.",grvxg0d,ma3txq,attackontitan,2021-03-23 03:43:07,3,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

I'm struggling to see genuine conflict, I believe Pieck & Jaw are no match for Eren (Even before he had the warhammer) and I also believe Reiner is no where near a match for Eren on a 1v1 anymore (also before he had WH Titan)...

Eren can transform 3 times with moderate stamina at the 3rd while getting surprise fucked by the War hammer, Cart and Jaw, so now he has WH and completely composed on home soil i could easily see him quickly dispatch Jaw, possibly cart (how would she even get out of the shackles that fast) and solely focus on Reiner and the army...

and that is all without even talking about Eren having the ability to take out the blimps with WH's range attacks AND Having Mikasa with an army of 3DM Soldiers AND Having Armin on back up AND Possibly having Levi turn up (please no spoilers)...

This leads me to the conclusion of concern, I feel like its almost 100% certain the show is going to pull something out of its ass to Balance the fight (My biggest fear is Levi being wounded \[so the shows most OP character can't end the season early\] and not turning up for any of these fights)

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Harpzeecord,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a HUGE AOT fan (as evidenced by my A4 size Levi tattoo which you can see on my profile). But I think the end of this seasons especially has fallen into the trap of becoming too complicated for its own good. 

I know they're going for mind blowing plot twists but ""the brightest star is all the more glorious for it's brevity"" and at this point with all the betrayals and side switchings nothing shocks anymore so surprises lose their impact. 

I think they've also taken the whole ""everyone has their own cause, which they believe to be good"" and ""there are only losers in war"" narrative a little too far and are pushing it v hard with quite in your face examples. 

Don't get me wrong I've loved this season, I just think it's getting a bit muddied down and stalling (especially with the entire penultimate episode being Zeke back story). The first half was so intense you could barely breathe and now it's really slowed to a crawl, albeit the Levi Vs Zeke pt3. 

Also not knowing who to root for and by extension if the MC's motivations are true (does Eren support euthanasia, does he hate Mikasa etc) instills so much doubt to the point where any shock plot twists with MC motivations you just instinctively go ""probably a bluff, nah can't see that happening"". This combined with constant twists and turns makes it hard to get behind the plot and build momentum with it.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,thegoodmanhascome,"I see a lot of theories about how eren will escape this. I haven’t read the manga, and only started watching the show a few months ago, so my predictions are either totally off (95% chance) or mostly on the money (1%) and then partly right (4%). But hey, I’ve gotten done weird predictions right before and so far. But there are a lot of details and nuances in this show which I’ve not noticed/thought about. Any way, mild caution at the remote possibility that I’m right about any of this. 

 I don’t think this is a matter of escape. 

I think Eren’s plan is to eat each of the other titans, and I think that’s what we’ll see here. I think he’s going to eat all of them, including Armin and Zeke, to bring together all of the Titans into one vessel again, like Ymir’s Titan. Like Thanos, it will have costed him everything. 

I think that in this battle in the beginning of part 2, I think that we are not only going to see Eren win, but succeed in getting three more titans added to his repertoire. Leaving only Annie, Zeke and Armin left. 

I also do not buy for a second that eren wants to euthanize everyone. He plans on starting this “rumbling” thing, and killing everyone except eldians. He wants to redeem his father more than anything. Unless I’m totally wrong and he only wants justice for his mother. In which case, he will euthanize everyone. 

We know that if Eren touches Zeke, he would have the founding titan’s ability. What if eren ate him? If he got his powers that way, that would leave only Annie, and Armin standing in the way to protect her. They will most likely move Annie outside of the city, and Armin will feel safe to bring out his titan. Then Levi and Mikasa will probably swoop in and almost kill Eren. But fail. 

Now here’s the thing. Based on what I’ve seen of this creator, there is going to be a concrete ending. And there is a grand purpose for why this story is being told now, and not later on. If Eren is defeated, then that leaves the possibility that someone else will do this in the future. If he does the Zeke euthanizing thing, I guess it ends, but it could still be reversed, by Historia or her baby. If he goes on a global genocide, that’s really the only way it’s all over. It’s a sad ending, but this is the anti hero that Eren has become. It would be an extremely controversial ending, and would absolutely spark HUGE interest in the show.

Can Eren use warhammer titan (can be transform into it instead of the Attack titan or is the Warhammer titan abilities inside of him without needing to look like it)

Something tells me that Zeke saw Ymir (that little girl, even shown in trailer) and I think she was the one ordering the titan to save him.. Maybe a stretch but at this point, what ever is possible.

And to make it a bit easier for me is that I keep reminding myself that Eren, Zeke and Armin will eventually die because of the curse of Ymir, if they don't manage to undo it somehow.

But this episode did something very specific to me, during a scene in two parts. It's about the story that both his grandfather and his father read to Zeke. These are two completely opposing stories regarding the same incident and both are considered history by the people that believe each side. Credible, objective and factual history. And that goes for knowledge in general.

And then large groups of people take two polar opposite narratives for granted, they create friends and enemies. The power but also the danger of this dichotomy lies in the fact that the stories believed by each side are black and white. The fact that there is no grey, leaves no room for compromise and trust and also deepens the animosity. This is also very very true in real life, in countries' and nations' relations but also in the relations between smaller groups of civilians.

After all this, of course the ones that are damaged the most are the future generations, the children that are born into communities of hatred against the opposing side.

* Poor Mikasa and Armin. They love Eren so much and to see and hear him tell Mikasa that he's always hated her, then have Eren mess up Armin... So sad. There's some debate about Eren having a tear in his eyes in that last scene, but it could just be reflection. Maybe I'm hoping it was a tear :(
* I wonder if what Eren said about the Ackerman's simply locking onto protecting someone is true. I need to rewatch that scene. I think if it is true that that was truly what led Mikasa to protect Eren, I also don't think it necessarily would invalidate her feelings and love for him.
* Y'all... I hate Floch. I think I dislike him more than any character on the show.
* Also, KEITH!!! I don't know if he died?!!?!? But if he did what a tragic way for him to go -- his story revolves around constantly being proven he's not good or 'special' enough, and here comes Floch completely undermining his leadership/that under Eren and Jaegerists is better than his leadership, and making all of Keith's cadets turn on him. 
* Zeke's backstory was painful. Feels kinda raw and real to what children of any extremism can go through. Those scenes of him being torn apart by Grisha's disapproval and disappointment was too freakin real 
* LEVI. Oh my GOD. So much loss. He already feels like he's bearing the weight of his choices saving Eren and helping him become who he turned out to be... And to top it off, he said yes to his cadets to bring that wine along. Yet another heavy loss that he feels is his fault. Just wanna hug him.
* OK BUT ALSO I was SCREAMING at Levi to just kill Zeke. I know the Beast should get passed down strategically but GOD I was over it hahaha

First of all, where is all this mass brain washing going on to convince every single Eldyan that they are lesser and need to atone for something they had nothing to do with? Humans don't just wake up and think ""ah shit guess I'm part of the trash race."" There is one underground organisation that's only half convinced but I haven't seen a single non-paradise Eldyan that thinks they are normal humans. So where is it happening? Even places like North Korea have defectors that realise their country is lying to them even though they are fed propaganda about how evil the west is from the moment they are born. Are Eldyans just genetically fucking stupid?

Mikasa's brain washing isn't much better. I seriously doubt you could train a 5 year old to be a murderer for their entire life to the point where they physically cannot control themselves when some triggers happen.

And all that is making all their plans really fucking stupid. They have SO much power in their hands with the titans and yes they also deeply despise the titans but you have so many options. You could kill all the Marleans, you could force them into an agreement, you could work with other countries. But no, the ""plan"" they have is to kill themselves, sterilise their entire race, or probably stop whatever it is that makes Eldyans into titans.

Even Eren is now somehow convinced all Eldyans need to be sterilised or what the fuck ever.

Zeke could have just transform when they were talking together in Marley and Eren could have touched him and use the power of the founding. Sure, the military would have found it suspicious for him to transform inside a city, but that seems like a small price to pay to accomplish his life-long objective.

The only reason I can find is that they first want to unite the world against Eldian, so that the annihilation of Eldian can help bring world peace?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Paprikal,"One thought I had while watching ep. 74: I wonder how some characters from Paradise would have reacted if they learned about this plan. If we take someone like Armin, I feel like he could have understood the rationale behind erasing the Eldian to end the cycle of hatred and protect the world ; but at the same time, he would probably react similarly to Kaya, with the (quite understandable) discourse that ""the people in the wall didn't do anything wrong, why must be punished"".

That's what I found interesting: we can say that the people living in the wall have generally led better lives than the Eldian in Marley (except maybe the Scouts). That's why they would probably see Zeke's plan as unjust toward them. But to Zeke, Eren, and Ms.Ksaver, ending the lives of Eldian is not a punishment but a mercy, because in the world that they know, living as an Eldian means suffering.

And this also maybe helps to explain why Zeke doesn't show any remorse when he's killing Eldian: maybe he genuinely believes that he is doing them a favor by killing them (and his dialogue with Levi about how ""he didn't kill people, he saved lives"" seems to point to that direction).

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skyclad__Observer,"Genuinely very impressed by this episode. The CGI was a little weird in parts, but they actually used it to make some really impressive high-speed action that I just don't think would have been possible in 2D. To me 3D shouldn't be used unless it can justify its inclusion, and MAPPA looks to be doing that so far. The environment design and background art are both incredible, I think this might be my new favorite art style aside from Season 2. The color palette too is a big step away from WIT's brighter/sharper choices, but it worked phenomenally well in Slava, and contributed to the feeling that this was an actual battlefield. Another thing I noticed was a few decent moments of character animation, which is relieving because I was worried there might be *too* many static conversations. Hope they can keep it up. I was glad to hear at least one old track as part of the music, but the newer stuff worked well for this particular episode even if it was a bit different than Sawano's usual stuff. Sound design was great too, with the constant sounds of war in the background. 

Directing was good as well, even though this episode wasn't directed by Hayashi. Well paced both in terms of dialogue and action, and some interesting shot composition here and there as well. I especially loved the aerial shots of Fort Slava, the silhouetted shot of the Mid-East forces walking back and forth on the walls, the POV cut of the Mid-East soldier mowing down Eldians with that machine gun, and the shots leading up to the drugged Eldians being thrown off the airship.",gevlyet,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 22:44:57,16,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Skyclad__Observer,"K I N O

I thought it was pretty much perfect. They did a fucking incredible job in building up the tension throughout the episode, exactly as I was hoping for. I think the things that stood out to me the most were actually the moments of silence, where they gave certain moments just enough room to breath. There's a few cuts in the first half where Eren, Reiner, and Falco just stand around in the basement in complete silence with only the faint sound of music pouring through the window that was just great. I think the soundtrack choices were all fantastic and fitting of the tone, though I guess I sort of understand why some may have wanted something more bombastic over the actual transformation segment. Even then, I think the complete silence leading up to the actual transformation does a good job of keeping the tension there until the very climax, rather than tipping off the viewer that something big is going to happen as soon as the BGM peaks. My first time reading chapter 100, that was the prevailing feeling I was experiencing. Shear confusion over what Eren was about to do. At the very start it seems clear he's about to wreck havoc -- ""Same reason as you"". But as soon as the music changes to that sad soft piano piece, and Eren starts talking about understanding the people beyond the walls, you're suddenly thrown for a loop, questioning if all this was a misdirect, and Eren has really changed so much that he's willing to part ways with war and take a more peaceful route with Reiner. Of course, you're left with this feeling of uncertainty up to the very moment Eren stands up and starts to glow, and that's when I was really blown away (along with everyone in those apartments)

in the manga i felt like things were going at a slower pace and at the same time there was still a LOT of tension in the air, then all of a sudden eren fucking transforms and destroys the stage. the way it was set up in the manga really gave more off a slow ticking time bomb feel which is why erens transformation hits a lot harder for me there

in the anime i didnt get to feel the same 'ticking time bomb' feel. it was there, but it was significantly weaker imo. i think the reason why erens transformation felt less explosive was just because they slowed it down. they made erens initial transformation when he shook reiners hand a slow mo, and then the way the buildings cracked felt slower than i expected. if it was more instantaneous BUT with a little bit more setup beforehand it would have been much more hype

Main observations:  
God, this episode also reminded me of just how awful Magath was early on in the series.  


The final shot of the navy's destruction from beneath the sea after Zeke bombards them was KILLER. Like, wow, this is what an anime adaptation of a manga is all about - giving new and unique perspectives on the scenes we love.  


Another great adapted scene was Reiner's mid-air transformation. Showing the armored form around him as he falls, and the pose... so damn cool!  


I also like the new visual for ""inside a titan"" a lot. The WIT style wasn't bad but... it always seemed weirdly roomy in there. Mappa's style makes it feel like a really cramped and, for lack of better word, gross space with all the innards and veins all over the screen. I like that a lot!  


CG was noticable during Reiner and Porco's assault on the fort especially, but otherwise was good. Not mind-blowing, but rarely got in the way.  


I actually really love the opening. In my ideal AoT opening it is either ridiculous and epic like Linked Horizon or does WEIRD SHIT and this is definitely a certified WEIRD SHIT opening and I am here for it. I just wish there was a bit more symbolism. This is gonna be sooo controversial though I can tell!  


The ending on the otherhand, we've only seen partially, but we can see Ymir and paths in it so that's enough for me!  


Voice actors were amazing, and the episode looked consistently great too.  


The teaser with Jean at the end was interesting too. I always thought it was implied the Paradis scouts had infiltrated Marley for a while but... to see it actually confirmed was cool!  


Overall, I really enjoyed it! I can't wait for more! The declaration of war is gonna be incredible.",gewembf,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 02:57:37,22,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

I agree that the music for the last scene didn't quite reach the hype that most people (me included) had built up for the scene but... I still liked it!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not complaining about the Declaration of War, I think that was sick. But one take that's always bothered me is the whole ""Youseebiggirl is the WARRIORS' song, so it can't play anywhere else!"" argument. Like, it literally played when Eren activated the coordinate at the climax of Season 2, so how is it the Warriors' song? To be specific, it built up to his punch with Attack on D (which in and of itself has the same melody as Youseebiggirl and Apple Seed) and then it switched to Youseebiggirl before going back to Attack on D as the Scouts ran away, so, like, it's really not the Warriors' song. Plus, the main melody of Attack on D (which, again, is the same as YSBG) has played a few other times throughout the anime as well.

If people are referring to the Vogel im Kafig part being the Warriors' song, then that's just not true either, because it's been played a million times throughout the series. Not to mention that Sawano usually names his tracks quite quirkily to allude to their meanings (Attack on D for Dina, K2 being a Japanese pun for Kenny, the Female Titan theme having the female symbol) so I don't get how ""Youseebiggirl"" could relate to Reiner and Bert at all.

So just, all in all, the whole thing about Youseebiggirl being Reiner and Bert's theme feels more like a romanticization on behalf of the fan base than a deliberate trend that the anime has set up, because it is quite literally *not* their theme. I just take this conflation as more of a testament of how iconic and well-done their reveal in Season 2 was.

And if I have to type Youseebiggirl one more time, I'm going to vomit.

End rant.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,sharethebear1,"Episode was really great as a whole, and the music choice for the dialogue stuff was way better than what I expected, easily 10/10 there. 

Again with 2Volt subverting our expectations, huh? It's not a bad fit, and it worked especially well with the soldiers breaching the basement (which was a really cool detail for MAPPA to add), but man. Like, after rewatching, I still think the scene is really good and really well done, but it easily could've been a lot better. MAPPA had to have known what caliber of song readers were expecting, so I just, like, *really* wanna sit down with whoever made the decision to use 2Volt and just ask them why.

Still a 10/10 episode and the scene is still amazing; anyone who says it's flatout bad is honestly having a kneejerk reaction.

We all know that Eren's gonna transform and kill Willy, but going into it blind it's easy to see that they're setting it up so you have no clue what Eren's gonna do, especially given that for once he ain't yelling or speaking angrily at Reiner or Falco. ""Is he really gonna transform and kill all those innocents, especially given how much he hated Reiner and Bertholdt for 'being mass murderers' in the past? It seems like Eren forgave Reiner and the Warriors over what they did in the past.""

Watching the full episode reaffirms my belief that YouSeeBigGirl would have been an awful choice, and even then I don't think the leaked OST would work as well as people think if that's the mood the studio was trying to convey. Woulda been nice to have a different track outside of 2volt though cuz I def think it feels too ""heroic(?)"" per say given, y'know, this marks where Eren fully committed to activating the Rumbling and he's committing terrorism lmao.

I wasn't too impressed by Season 3 Part 2's adaptation for the most part as a lot of it had similar issues to what I see people complaining about in this week's episode. Animation, music choice, etc... so since then, I've kept my expectations low and realized that how I imagine manga panels in my head does absolutely not mean that's how the staff who gets to animate it imagines it. Keep your expectations low, and you won't get disappointed.

That said, I did enjoy this episode, and I can understand people who were disappointed, because I was like that as well like I said. So trust me when I say that it's not healthy.",girx09o,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-10 17:41:14,59,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

To be completely honest, nothing could have surpassed my expectations for this episode. It was still well done, though.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Mrtheliger,"2Volt worked perfectly for the ending, overreacting asses. My absolute only problem with the episode was the lack of emphasis on ""Because I was born into this world."" I always imagined it as a sweeping line, that he lets the audience really savor and take in, making them think about the deep implications of such a simple phrase. Maybe his voice tremors at the end as he says world, because he knows that he is mere moments from his death. Maybe the most important line of the speech apart from the actual declaration.

Instead it felt more like a throwaway line, that you maybe aren't meant to feel the weight of without knowing it's a callback. Eren's reaction was good and let the casual viewer know it wasn't just a throwaway line, but damn I honestly was really disappointed in it. Actually maybe my biggest disappointment with the season so far, assuming the Willy/Magath carriage chat gets put back in. I guess I sort of wish they had focused on Eren's face when Willy mentioned going to war with Paradis, because it's the moment he knew for certain that his future memories were set in stone, and why he and Zeke hadn't yet touched in the first place.

I've genuinely never imagined Youseebiggirl fitting with the tone of 100, the only reason I can even imagine it working is for a parallel with Warrior, which in theory is cool but the moments are very different. The Declaration of War is more akin to Annie's transformation in Stohess than Warrior, since both are situations where the opposing party know exactly what's coming but are helpless to really stop it.

Personally I would've preferred a new OST than 2volt, but after listening to the portion of 2volt they use I can see it working much better than Youseebiggirl. I think a lot of people just have it in their heads that nothing can top youseebiggirl, even though WMID literally already exists. From more rational comments it sounds like the episode was really good, if more of a budget saving one from an animation perspective, but had a few things that definitely were negative.

Basically, what I've been saying from before the first episode. This isn't going to top the manga, and people who thought it could had way too high expectations and had likely not even read the manga from before the timeskip, so they don't even know that WIT's adaptation skipped a lot and even wasn't better from a visual perspective by season 3.",girwp86,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-10 17:38:35,29,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

For the Marley arc especially I never expected visuals to surpass the manga, and I'm actually liking the CG titans so far because it's not like we see a whole lot of Titans, relatively, from this point on anyway. But God the pacing was so great, and every VA choice is on point.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,reddadz,"Despite the CGI being blatantly obvious in a lot of shots, the movement seemed pretty good (especially with Jaws & Cart). Armored looked good in most shots but had 1 or 2 hiccups. Beast for me was the weakest, both in looks and movement.

Gabi stole the entire episode. While I'm still indifferent to her in the manga, I could see the anime making me like her more. Didn't expect the Jean (could be Willy?) cameo at the end so it looks like we're getting some anime-original scenes in Marley; can't wait to see what else they have in store.

The OP was.....meh. I see what they were going for with the abstract war motif but I was pretty underwhelmed. ED was pretty good, on the other hand. The focus on Falco & Ymir makes me anxious to see what'll happen in the final chapters.

Overall, I'd say this was a good premiere (8/10). People on both sides of the WIT/MAPPA divide will find reasons to like this episode.",geuarvt,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 16:47:43,27,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,reddadz,"I can understand (and somewhat agree) with the OST complaint. I personally didn't want YSBG but 2Volt seemed too triumphant. Which is weird since MAPPA seems to be portraying Eren with less emotion than I expected, hence there's a clash with the music.

Upon rewatch, I like the whole declaration scene a lot more now; the first time, it was underwhelming to me. Willy's play was portrayed well & the tension was so thick the entire episode. Really the only issue I have was the tonal dissonance with the OST.

These 2 chapters had 99% dialogue so the still images didn't bother me. They actually fit way more than I expected (saw a rumor that the Warrior trap & Karina/Leonhart would be moved to next episode). 

I'd give this a 8.5/10. People understandably had extremely high expectations given this is easily a top 3 moment in the manga & I can see why they'd be disappointed.",girytr7,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-10 17:56:52,25,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

All the things I never noticed in the manga, like the way they  say devil, and are brainwashed into believing that. I also never thought about the fear that must be being a Titan sacrifice before. Mappa certainly got the discomfort of this arc down. It was so *unsettling* to watch those poor(certainly won’t be poor after potat is gone) kids be completely brainwashed and treated like that.

After reading a few other comments I went back and rewatched the ending and yeah they definitely coulda used a better song than some royalty free ass YT sounding song but I didn't really notice it at all on my first watch, so maybe it isnt as bad as people think?

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,DarthStallord98,"Are we not allowed to criticize? For every person complaining about the music, 10 people pounce that person telling them to stop whining. I defended the shit out of the past 4 episodes. Even the cuts to Reiner's backstory. I understood that MAPPA was allocating their resources and I was very pleased with their choices. 

For this episode, I wasn't really pleased all that much. I thought the animation during Eren and Reiner's talk was too stiff. I thought the music choices weren't that good. I think the leaked ost would've been perfect. Everything just seemed to go by too fast. It didn't have the same impact as the slow buildup of the RB reveal in season 2. I was a manga reader for both of these scenes.

I know how ungrateful people can be given how overworked MAPPA has been with the insane deadline for this anime. I still am enjoying this season overall very much and am excited for these next few episodes. But I did not really like this episode from an artistic perspective. I thought the directing and sound design could've been much better. The stiff animation is something I can definitely overlook given how much of a workload the animators are dealing with. 

If you enjoyed this episode then don't let me or anyone else ruin that for you. This is the peak of Attack on Titan storywise in my opinion. Just don't completely shit on people who don't like it as much as you do.

2 DAYS LATER EDIT ~ After rewatching this episode a few times I absolutely love it lol. Even everything I said I disliked earlier. I loved the musical cues (still would've preferred something a bit more epic at the end). I love the visuals. The animation has grown on me. I feel a little bad now for what I said earlier. It was kind of an immediate reaction after seeing the episode on a shitty NHK stream without subtitles. Although, I still stand by my point about not ragging on people who don't like certain things about this show. It's not a perfect show because there's no such 
 thing as a perfect show. Their complaints only seem annoying because YOU choose to respond to them instead of ignoring it and not letting it diminish your enjoyment.",gis59go,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-10 18:49:09,107,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

The trailer OST fits very well to the moment where titan Eren jumps out from the building. It makes the scene very “epic“.

I do also like the silence in the actual episode though. The music stops just after Eren smiles and reaches his hand out to Reiner. If you are an anime-only, it makes you think until the very last moment that maybe, Eren will just make peace with Reiner lol.
The suddenness of what is about to happen gets lost in the “epic“ edit, since you can already hear the music rising.

Not sure if I am a big fan of 2volt in that scene though. It does fit well animation wise, I just think it sounds a little too heroic for what is happening.

Personally, I did not have a problem with the OST that was used at all. My only nitpick is maybe how the ending shots were animated.

Sure the Armored and Beast titans looks good but they are really really inferior to their protrayal by WIT imo, when Reiner was just jumping around destroying the canon I thought it was pretty awkward. I don't really know how to say it but to me it makes me lose their ""weight"" in a sense, kinda na Uncanny Valley feeling but it's more like how the Colossal was portrayed as a mountain of power in 2D but was feeling like it was an inflated balloon in CG.

The mindless titans I saw weren't CG I think so I would have preferred the other way around, mindless in CG and Shifters in 2D.

I haven't seen the full episode and It's only the first one so I won't judge the new season based on that alone tho as everything else I saw was great. I just hope the shifters won't always be full CG...

I already saw op, ed, and some shots. 

op is definitely not bad, I wouldn't talk shit about it, but I don't have much to say yet, and the song is pretty good although, I'd be happy to get LH.

ed is GREAT. First place with ending one probably, or even dethrones it. I like the parallel between ed6, Falco's ending, and ed1 Mikasa's ending.

I was hyping myself that we're getting a Willy Tybur tease, but it ended up being Jean. For a few minutes I was somewhat disappointed that the tease didn't happen, but tbh getting Jean is also great. 

When people were shit talking about cgi monke i was getting worried, and in fact, From the single image I saw of it until now, it does look weird, but whatever. Hope the climax of the saga will be good.

I also couldn't resist to see ep 2 pv, and I must say, I immediately started laughing because that commander (don't remember his name) looks like a mustache-less Hitler, and someone also pointed it out on Youtube so...

Off topic, I really think that  leakers are unfortunately hinting that the Rumbling will not be adapted as a TV anime.

Unpopular opinion probably, but the Plot Armor Titan looked the worst, and the slowness. Angles were a bit disappointing sometimes, but that's fine I guess. Most of what I said here makes it seem as if I didn't like the episode at all, but in fact I liked it very much, and was enjoying finally having season 4. My friend who read up to the end of Marley saga seemed to be excited during the episode,but had the same criticism as me. He said that the animation as a whole got somewhat worse, and the other one agreed with him. The former still looks forward for chapter 100ish the most, and he still hates Gabi for potatoing Sasha, cause she was probably one of his favourites, and he didn't get the full picture yet.

i think the 2 places it stuggles most at the moment is hair and movement.

the fact that the titans on some frames hop between being animated at 24 frames and 12 is something that can really take you out of the scene, especially so when going from fast movements to calm. reiners roll to avoid the train is a good example of this. flows alright, but the animation is very start/stop as soon as the movement is over.

also hair. I think this is the most jarring thing, and why the beast titan specifically is called out as an issue. the Shaders themselves are good, but the way the hair on the titans moves needs a bit of work, since it can really desync with the motion sometimes.

Despite all that, I still think this episode was fantastic. I just wish the pace wasn't so fast. I felt like this was a problem in episode 3 too. It's not about the cut content but rather how much each scene is allowed a chance to breath and truly shine. Moving from one dialogue to the next sort of fails to have that impact on me that it had while I was reading the manga but that may just be me idk. Like I love how they took the Dr. Jaeger flashback in Episode 4 and made it so much more unique.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Otheagony,"And it all comes full circle. The moment when you hear the Colossal Titans theme from the first episode you know what's about to happen, and Reiner's dread at the realisation makes it all the more impactful. Throughout the first half you can sense the buildup, in the music and the different chain of events starting to kick off. The play itself serves as good buildup whilst at the same time giving us the exposition to why the start of the series happened, and now that we know why the first attack on the walls happened all those years ago, we now ask why Eren is about to attack Marely and ho it came to this moment.

Another point I liked is how throughout the episode, Eren just looked dead in the eyes, no emotion, nothing, they were bland and you could barely see his pupil, whereas Reiner, Falco and everyone else on Marely, had eyes so full of life, again drawing parrallels to the first episode. But what makes it even more frightening is that we only see life and emotion in Erens eyes once he talks once more about destroying his enemies. This time, he isn't saying it off to the distance or to himself, he's doing so whilst looking directly into his enemies eyes. He's now reached the moment he always talked about, and he knows it, but somehow we can barely tell what he's feeling, after seeing him get so angry, so emotional about talking about this goal of his back on Paradis, when you see him say it now, so bluntly and without emotion, you know that the Eren we know is gone, all that's left is a machine of pure will and destruction.

It was obviously a great episode because the content is just so good and it was a solid adaptation of it but I wish they went above and beyond. It could've easily been one of the best episodes in any anime but I don't think it's on that level because it felt like just another episode adaptation wise, rather than a standout in the way it deserved, like the best HxH or Gintama episodes are for example. 

Main complaint like everyone else is the declaration of war which was a little underwhelming, though that's for sure impacted by the leaked OST. In the manga it's easily the best moment in the series up until that point but I feel like quite a few moments in the anime surpass it. Eren empathising with Reiner didn't really hit as hard as the manga as well but I can't really explain why tbh. I think the contrast between the more personal conversation and Willy's theatrical speech was done better in the manga as well.

However the rest of the episode felt like a slight downgrade from the manga, like every shot is 90% of the quality of the manga panel. Way too many jarring jumps between scenes, the crowd responded quite weakly to Willy's emotions and he himself didn't deliver enough emotion into the line ""But I don't want to die"".

I also am not a fan that Reiner was mostly a bit more confident in the anime and that they didn't show the people in the building as Eren transformed, killing them. Those were decisions, not lack of effort or skill. But I don't understand these choices.

CG ain’t bad. Cart and Jaws look better with. Beast Titan has its faults and kinda lost its “punch” with the stark and arguably boring visual transition. Armored titan probably looks awkward in like two shots, otherwise spectacular job and decent movement. Sometimes CG can get “too fluid” in contrast to the outlaying 2D so glad I don’t feel that here.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,HistoriaTheFirst,"I have posted nothing but dozens of positive comments all day about the episode, including the content and the OP and ED both of which I absolutely adore. 

I think you guys watch a lot more anime than me. The CGI didn’t bother me at all. There were only a few scenes where I could tell it was CGI. I’m truly not seeing how Zeke looks worse than the others and I’m really trying to (but like I said, this sounds like a me problem).  So my following criticisms have nothing to do with the CGI. 

Here is some criticism:

-MAPPA’s eyes aren’t the same as WIT’s. That might sound minor, but WIT brought about so much emotion in characters’ expressions with their eyes and that first scene of Falco waking up showed just how lacking MAPPA is in this department. 

-The color palette was overall dull. It was as if a fade filter had been placed over every single scene and it’s just not as visually appealing 

-I didn’t mind the CGI but the blur was real. There were several times I had to pause and rewind because I thought my connection was bad because my screen seemed blurry all of a sudden, but nope, that was the actual episode 

-The lack of a score in certain scenes really stood out

-I love the OP, don’t get me wrong. The scenes we do have that have actual content are exactly what I wanted for this arc, and those scenes alone were done so well that it made the OP one of my favorites of all time.  Those scenes are perfect. But there were several scenes of just colorful clouds, not even explosions. I hope that they’re going to add to the OP as the season goes, but if they don’t do that, I am really questioning the decision to include several seconds of literal clouds with nothing else in an OP of such a popular series. 

-Adding to that, while the ED is beautiful, it also has scenes of just sparks flying around for several seconds. 

-I watched the live stream this morning and I’ve seen the Hulu official sub as well as clips of the fanmade subs. Gabi’s hair has a distinct purple hue. While that may sound super nitpicky, in a series where characters are made to look realistic, I really must wonder why MAPPA chose to go with such an unnatural hair color for her. It’s definitely not black or dark red; it’s purple. 

Most of my critiques are really minor things because I honestly believe MAPPA did a great job overall. I can’t count how many times I got emotional over this episode today that was based on a chapter I didn’t particularly feel much for in the manga. Good on MAPPA. I look forward to their next episodes.",gex3krg,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 07:25:15,27,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

They could have not added the soldiers searching for eren and let the dialogue flow as it is. Although, I have to agree that manga readers have played this scene differently in their mind, of course there will be disappointment. The flow of the chapter in the manga is soooo perfectly drawn.

The ost will grow on me as I continue to rewatch this, but the edited version with the fan-made ost is the headcanon for me lol. At least Eren's sorrowful and accepting smile is there at the end, that's the key development in this chapter. All in all, great episode.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,BasedKenpachi,"This episode was good, but I have some critiques. The focus is mostly on Willy's speech, which draws away from the center of the episode going on between Eren and Reiner. When Willy says ""Eren Yaeger,"" he was supposed to SCREAM IT, or at least make it have some sort of significance in production, instead it got mixed down and filtered to where it lost all intensity. The OST used when Eren transforms is not very fitting in my opinion, I would've liked something more dramatic. Additionally on Eren's transformation, the animation was mostly stills, which was a little disappointing. They decided to add in soldiers storming the basement for some reason, I'm assuming to make the anime-only fans feel like Eren *had* to transform and had no other choice, when it was really his plan all along. This just adds confusion, frankly, because people who haven't read the manga will read Eren's intentions incorrectly. It was a good episode, but it could've been better.

EDIT: The art looked amazing, Eren and Reiner's voice actors really went in",gisj3r5,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-10 20:51:30,14,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Viviiiieeee_96,"Love how titanfolk turned the OST complaints into a new meme. 

Anyways, I liked episode. The tension buildup was just wonderful, and even I, who knows what will happen, is getting nervous. The OST disappointing people is an odd complaint, but I believe that this quiet background noise of 2volt fits the scene more than YSBG. I was kinda disappointed at first, but the more I rewatch, the better it gets.

Now, time for my personal fangirling about voice actors and actresses essay. Reiner's VA (Yoshimasa Hosoya) captured his emotions well. I could really feel that he was guilty and regretful of his actions to Paradis Island. And Yuki Kaji... He nailed the calm Eren voice very well. It just felt like Eren aggressively guilt tripping Reiner in the basement scene like the manga but more intense. Also Falco's VA was pretty great too.

I also wanna comment on Pieck's scream while falling down the hole. It's really cute lmao. And then Yelena's voice actress was amazing, her voice (probably lowered down to fit Yelena's disguise) was not exactly the one in my head, but it feels great seeing her voice acted.

yeahhhhh that's it, also one of the guys in panzer unit look like the guy in the chad meme. probably the chin",givnx78,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-11 14:42:04,10,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Zeke’s plan (even if it was a lie) was to reclaim the founding Titan to deter the world from attacking Marley. He tells the warriors that the Tyburs will narrate ... something ... so they can do that. What was he even talking about?

I'm really miffed that Willy and Magath's carriage conversation was skipped though. That convo was extremely important in (further) humanising Willy, humanising Magath, and providing a concrete reason for why the brass of the Marlyean military and tons of diplomats were purposely packed together. It would also reveal that Willy knew he would likely die. 

Maybe the next episode will have the carriage convo as the prelude, and with Willy ending the conversation alluding to the fact that he expects to die.

As for the episode itself, it felt... good. It definitely felt like AoT, except a few weird parts (music was uncanny in certain scenes, I'm undecided on the OP and ED). But otherwise, its at the standard we expect from an AoT anime. Well done MAPPA.

Gabi though... man, I actually forgot how manipulative she could be if she's determined. She played on Magath's own hesistation and relutance, netting herself a chance to shine.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,ShingekiNoEren,"I feel like the anime-onlies' reaction to Eren slaughtering civilians at the festival isn't going to be as drastic or controversial as when it happened in the manga.

Remember how that was a super huge and controversial thing between manga readers? One side immediately branded Eren as an evil monster, the other side still believed that what Eren was doing was justified/for the greater good, and some people were pretty much neutral.

I'm a Jaegerist myself and I hope at the end of the manga, Eren wins. But I still remember being a bit shocked when Eren started killing civilians at the festival.

I think this was because of the month-long wait between chapters, which kinda artificially made us think we were more attached to these characters than we should be. It took 10 months from us first being introduced to the Marleyan POV to see Marleyan and other civilians getting slaughtered by Eren. In that time frame, we had a lot of time to make fanart, theories, analyses, re-read the chapters, and just in general sympathize with and appreciate the Marleyan side of things. That's why, when Eren came swinging, it caused such a schism in the fanbase.

But...it's not gonna take 10 months from this episode to reach the Battle of Liberio. A single anime episode almost always condenses multiple manga chapters inside of it. And we're not getting one episode a month, but one a week. It's gonna be a lot shorter of a wait, which gives the anime-onlies less time to become attached to the new characters.

On another note, where do you guys think that this 16-episode season will leave us?

Because Eren has begun doing what the Warriors did, massacring innocent people. I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MPYyqJJHL4) OST would have fit that narrative much better.

We get it people, you visualized an OST you liked and decided by yourself as the only fitting one for that moment, grow the fuck up. The episode itself was remarkably good and did justice to the manga, while YES, i agree that 2volt wasn't the best choice, it wasn't anywhere close to the worst either. YSBG on the other hand would have blatantly sucked for this scene, although i couldn't say the same for the declaration of war theme samuel leaked a few weeks ago.

But is this nearly enough to condemn MAPPA as a studio? nah, FUCK that. the moment was still hype as HELL, and i thoroughly enjoyed it while not thinking a second of the OST choice. This isn't even about high expectations at this point, it's visualizing false bullshit such as the studio directors having the exact same taste as you in the music, the stills and everything else that wasn't ""up to par"", or ""underwhelming"", when in reality it's still great, just not exactly as you interpreted.

Personally could be the best episode of the season for me, absolutely nailed everything other than the music for the finale, which is still a banger and doesn't take away from anything in the scene.

What does worry me though is the number of episodes. I read that the Blu-rays of season 4 will be 16 episodes across 2 discs. I think 16 episodes is not nearly enough.

 There are rumors the story will be finished with movies and I'm not a fan of that idea at all. You can't just stitch 5 episodes together and say it's now a movie. It doesn't work that way. Movies have a different structure than tv shows. Manga or comic books like AOT or Walking Dead translate easier into tv series because they follow the same serialized structure. Novels translate easier into movies because they usually follow the same 3 act structure. Obviously they aren't mutually exclusive. You can turn a novel into a series or a manga into a movie. But it's way easier to take serialized manga chapters and turn them into serialized tv episodes (or chapters) than trying to fit them into a 3 act movie. You have to rework it more. 

Maybe they can pull it off but I just don't like the idea of them fucking with the story at the last stretch. But we'll see how it all pans out.",gj103aa,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-12 19:51:07,3,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Capt_Monty,"I just wanna put in perspective the comparison between the bertholdt and reiner reveal and declaration of war, becuz i think one of them elevated the scene in the anime while the other was only an acceptable adaptation.  I’m no mappa hater i love their work on season 4 so far but I feel like there’s a lot they could’ve done to make declaration of war feel like that wow moment. It’s fine as it is, but feels hollow at the same time and I wish they would’ve kept in some details such as the people above eren in the apartment building when he transforms or the punch through the stage.  Those are kinda nitpicks ik but the ost is an issue too that’s been talked abt so much already that I don’t need to say much abt it here, and the attack titan looked a bit whack and fat imo. As far as an adaptation of a big moment goes declaration just feels bare bones. On the other hand, the warriors reveal took a big moment and used a new ost, good pacing, and added bits like the flagpole snapping to make the scene that much more tense.  It took what was great in the manga and made it even better.  I wish mappa could’ve done the same for declaration, but as it is rn it’s not bad, it just could’ve been better. I’m very much looking forward to what mappa does w the next few episodes tho the shots we saw of eren and the warhammer in the preview look great.",gitfyd4,kuf4q0,titanfolk,2021-01-11 01:15:34,6,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IcarusIvys,"I am about to type something very long, its more like a vent than **complaint,** I just think it needed to be said.

I, as a manga reader who has loved SnK for the longest time, read the manga and watched the series several times, I think I had set way too high expectations of this scene, than what was projected. I think there could have been some details which could have made the last scene way better than it actually was.   
The episode through the entirety of it until the last scene was 10/10 for me, I loved the use of the good old OST from the previous seasons. I had tried to defend it from all sorts of false criticism (so please don't assume me to be one of those haters who falsely complain), but this time I have some things to say as well.  
I am happy seeing the anime-onlies be happy, but what they have in consideration while watching this episode is the progression of the story line as well execution, but we manga readers already know what is about to happen so we focus more on the execution of the scene.   
Even some of the YT motion mangas had depicted this chapter in a better way (in the OST department especially).  
Here are some of things I personally think could have been done well.  


* For the people who are saying that YSBG wouldn't be a good match for this scene, yes I do agree with the fact that the symbolism of YSBG is a bit different from what was trying to be symbolized in this scene but you can't possibly tell me that 2VOLT, an OST which literally generates vibes of heroism is more suitable than YSBG? I just feel like we got played because of how we got hinted YSBG towards the end of ep4, but we got this. Yes I am aware of the fact that we can still get a redone scene from the recap of this episode in the next episode, with a better OST, **but the impact can never be the same as how it could have been in this scene.** I'd have rather wanted the leaked OST which actually fit really well with this scene, or just anything new if YSBG didn't ""fit well"". I am saying this after watching lots of edits with different OSTs playing, and they do sound and fit in better. Yeah i understand the fact that the playing of YSBG or any other hype OST would giveaway what was about to happen, but I don't agree with that, if adjusted well, it could have still fit in with the surprise element punching in.  

* I really wish Willy's voice was more echoed and loud in the climax of the episode, to build the intensity and commotion. I wanted him to scream, with fear in his eyes. I did love the fact that his nervousness was reflecting in his voice, I just think it could have been louder, echoed and more focused.   

* We could have had details like, the Marleyan soldiers rushing down to the basement, I wish they were banging the door, during the climax of the scene before Eren transformed and they were storming in, it would be amazing to make it more intense.  

* I wanted Eren's titan to have more sharp features, the face looks really good, it looks more terrifying compared to that of WIT's design but I really wanted his eyes to look at Willy's, smashing his hands down the stage, and then lifting him up in the air. In this episode it looked really simple, it looked as though he just grabbed him and lifted him in the air, and the CG made Eren's titan at 21:57 look like a fat Roblox character, and I'm generally not even picky with animation.   

* I also wanted those manga textures that Reiner and Bertholdt had in their reveal, I wanted Eren to have it as well (would look sick and I know for a fact that MAPPA would have no problem doing it.)  

* In a nutshell, i just wanted more focus in the last part of the episode, in both animation and music department, slight elongation of it as well but i guess we didn't have time did we?  
Well it could still be adjusted by cutting some scenes and adding them later but oh well.

The animation was a 10, the voice acting and the pacing were a 10. The OST was a bit lacking in the end and i dont understand why they didn't choose a better track but it really didnt take anything away from Eren's transformation for me. Animation wise it was executed perfectly. I was holding my breath until the very last moment.

The moment reiner turns to falco with glowing Eren was perfect. They chose silence for the ""i keep moving forward until my enemies are destroyed"" which is fine but they could have used the chorus from a more iconic song or even the unreleased track we heard. 

Either way i suspect they did this to cater to the anime onlies which was bound to happen.

This episode was very good in regards of story progression. There was very good scene here and there but for some reason I am disappointed with art and animation (although I am not going to complain that much since they didn't have time to began with). VA are so incredible, they bought the life to the story. 

The biggest disappointed with me was tension. This episode was for tension but I barely feel it. The ost choice was worst. This season ost are not good in most part but now the most important episode had weak ost made it like joke. The art and animation quality are not good compared to previous episodes. It seems like from now on we will going to get less quality episode. 

There was some scenes which was cut from manga in previous episodes makes Annie , Reiner and bert conversation pointless or not meaningful to me. If I was anime only then I might have not understood it. That scene was so much important for character development ( to understand character).  And there was few scenes which was cut but not that important was discussion between Willy and Theo.

The best part of this episode was eren development. He acted only after declaration of war. He even was clam as fuck compared to previous seasons where he was so impulsive. The titan design was af🔥. Looking forward for war hammer titan. If next episode was done right, it might go down as best episode till now.

Gabi and Falco's VA were great. VA's for pretty much everyone did a very good job. Gabi's laugh after derailing the armored train made me squeal in delight, no joke, and I'm a guy so that's rare for me.

Jaw Titan looked great, Cart and pure titans were passable, the bigger titans were lackluster. Unfortunately, it will probably be the same for the Warhammer, Attack Titan etc. I didn't even notice Jaws was CGI at first. But Beast and Armored are an eye sore any time they move.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MrDollSteak,"I'll be honest, I might have like terrible eyes or something, but I straight up didn't even notice it was CGI until like one or two frames with the Beast Titan. The animation was absolutely incredible! The battle was excellent, with all of the titans managing to feel threatening and powerful even when going up against soldiers and armoured trains. Can MAPPA please go back and fix up the Colossal Titan from Season 2 and 3 for like a complete season blu-ray boxset or something now that they're on the production committee?

In all seriousness, I thought it was a great episode. I have full confidence in MAPPA going forward. It condensed the two chapters really well, and managed to fix all of the few issues that I had with the chapters in the manga itself, in terms of the tone and dialogue. I think that rather than feeling like an exposition dump this episode actually felt like a logical sequence in the progression of the overall story. The explanations about why the war was happening, why they were there, and who all the characters were, felt far more natural, and as a result my interest and engagement with the battle itself was much higher.

Controversially, I also think the nods to later chapters, Falco's vision, and Jean buying the newspaper were excellent touches, that also helped to sell why these sequences are important in the overall context of the narrative, and made Falco's introduction in particular, feel a lot more like a main characters by having some clear parallels to Eren's dream with Mikasa.

I really don't understand the criticisms about the OP or the other music throughout the episode, I felt like everything slapped. In all honesty, this OP is easily in my top 3 of what we've seen so far. It captured the more technological feel of this arc as well as the existential dread that defines it, in comparison to the upbeat medieval ones of previous seasons, and the explosions of colour on otherwise statue-like graphics was a fantastic contrast in my opinion. I also imagine some of these explosions will be toned back in later episodes as more information and battles are had, not that in my mind this really needs to happen as I think its fine regardless. It feels like its for a completely different anime granted, but I don't consider that a negative at all, because that's exactly how I felt about the overall story after reading chapters 90 and onwards. Everything that came before now feels more like the prequel to the ACTUAL action, and I think this mature and gritty direction is far superior.

Overall, I'm just so excited that this is actually happening. It's surreal that as the manga is ending we have the final season coming out, and it is so far, absolutely incredible as an adaptation, and as Isayama says the 'final' version of the story. Full disclosure, I felt the same way about Season 3, and thought that it was overall much better than the equivalent manga chapters throughout apart from the occasional 'Ereh' criticisms about Mikasa's characterisation. Nevertheless, I am fully expecting that Season 4 will be the perfect end to this story!",gew2ur2,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 01:09:19,46,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Hisuthepretty,"This episode accurately showcases the world's hatred for Eldians. The Eldians were used as suicide bombers, suicide titans, etc. without second thoughts for their lives. It was really sad to witness them die as tools. 

The scene of the Eldian man kissing the photo locket around his neck, which most likely held a photo of his wife or family members, before charging out to die was really heart breaking. He knows he will die as a tool and he will never see his family again. Also he most likely knew his death wouldn't amount to much or change how the world views Eldians but he gladly did it anyways for his family to have a better life than before. That's probably another reason why he kissed his necklace. He was doing it for them.

The Eldians were told their deaths would be meaningful but that isn't the case at all. Marley (and the world) will still see them as Eldian devils even though they are helping their oppressors to win a war. Even though Marleyans need them to survive, they treat them like crap. It's really sad.

Magath's voice actor is a great one too! He portrayed the actual voice my mind would give whenever he says something in the manga.

Have to get used with the CGI animation for the Titans, but their usage is still beautiful in my eyes.

Also, they managed to give hype to both anime-onlys and manga readers. The dialogue on Falco saying he flies with swords can be both forshadowing for the future chapters/episodes or just a fourth wall break for the animal onlys because of the change of perspective.

The opening gives a war-like tone, like it tells the story is not about eliminating Titans anymore, but in a much wider perspective of war between two sides. And the ending song just gives the usual Attack on Titan vibes: suffering and depression.

It might also end with chapter 113/114 with Erens escape/Pieck/spinal fluid wine as a cliffhanger and the Zeke/Levi forest confrontation as an action-heavy mid-season finale.

I would even say that if it were mappa that started AoT from season 1 instead of wit I would be satisfied (Not trying to debunk wit they did an amazing job as well).

I love the additional scenes they added as well with soldiers being gunned down and blown up to the extended battle of the armoured titan.

The opening again it's not wit but I do like it in its own way but it is very different but still good, also the end of the opening has erens attack titan on top of a bunch of other unique looking titans is that foreshading the current events of the manga I wonder?

The biggest thing for this episode and most likely the rest if the season is again yes it's very different compared to wit and the previous 3 seasons but and I big BUT it's completely ok being different because in its own way it's still fucking amazing.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,reicha7,"I thought it was really good. Took some getting used to the art style but the shifter titans look absolutely spectacular!

Really liked how they extended the fight with Reiner getting his ass handed to him (even if adding a second armoured train was a bit weird considering how important the first one was) but still proving how strong Titans were.

Liked the extra focus on the Eldian soldiers as they were being briefed for the suicide charge. The sheer horror on display and the nightmarish suicide vests (which is such a Marley thing to do) was a great flourish.

Gabi and Magath's VAs were absolutely phenomenal and really helped bring the chars to life.

Some of the really wide shots looked a bit janky at times. An example is when the titans are smashing into the ground and then just vanishing in a puff of smoke basically. 

I also always pictured Zeke's scream being a much more terrifying sound but maybe he'll do a better one in beast form.

I think in terms of pacing it was good to get both those chapters out the way in episode 1. I know people are concerned at a 2 per-episode pace but here it made sense as it was largely action and they still had to pad it out with extra shots to hit the runtime anyway. I imagine it will slow down again until episode 4 or so so we can get all the awesome world building and character interactions that made the Marley arc so great",gevlxsn,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 22:44:49,7,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,salmancharms,"The highlights of the episode:
-The OP with its unsettling nature; It was already expected it to be creepy from the same band who made the S2 ed. 

-The focus on deaths, dead bodies and atrocities of war; It really enhanced the theme of the Arc, like the soldiers watching from the heap of dead bodies, situation in trenches.

-The mindless Titans drop. That was just amazing! 

-The framrate and good CG; The fluidity of action scenes was amazing. The aerial shots, The armored train, Jaw Titan's scenes, Majority of Reiner's scenes were really good.

-Realistic colours and art; The detailing was really good. The scenes of Gabi destroying the train was too good. Although I liked the slightly saturated colours of WIT, I love the realistic colours too.

-The still scenes of bodies flying!

-The Eyes! Everyone was afraid of eyes not being to the level of WIT but MAPPA's eyes are amazing too.

-OUR BOI >!JEAN!<

-The soundtrack. It was good and immersive, especially after the mindless titan drop.

Minor things which I didn't like:
-The Jaw titans face; I loved how they animated him in the PV but downgraded him a little bit like the teeth, amount of hair,etc.

-Increased amount of CG on Reiner and Zeke; Reiner's CG while destroying the Fort looked really good but they should have kept it 2D in still scenes which made the CG prominent like Reiner signalling Zeke, Zeke destroying the ships. The shift from smooth action scenes to the jarring 12 fps hurt me.

-The ""Isn't war a terrible thing scene"". I had so much expectations for the scene from the small clip in PV, but they ruined it with CG Zeke. 

In my opinion, MAPPA is more or less saving it's budget for the *spoiler* >!The declaration of war and Liberio raid!< Which are much action packed and integral to the story.
Both the studios, WIT and MAPPA are amazing! As we have seen the news about the Production team's forceful calendar to release the season in less amount of time. So, we need to give MAPPA the benifit of the doubt!
Overall, I loved the episode! I liked the OP, which sets the mood for the arc. I'm excited for the future episodes! Let's see what's more to come.

P.S. I got to know from the comments that CGI wasn't done by MAPPA themselves, but was outsourced to another studio. I really hope the jarring CGI isn't repeated again!

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,IAteTheCheezyNacho," My thoughts:

The OP:

Its  visually quite good but its a bit repetitive and lacks variety. I love  the smoke effects and the explosions look gorgeous. The rainbow colours  picked sort of remind me of the rainbows in OP 5 and I adore the airship  and the soldiers marching, they really fit the Marley aesthetic.  This  all comes together to make an idea of war being romanticised by Marley  but the reality is different as then comes the images of the Marley  soldiers, Survey Corp scouts and the airship being smashed to pieces  showing how war is horrible and affects all.

Then  we get a liquid falling into a puddle and someone holding out their  hand in the rain, this I believe could be the blood rain we've seen  before in the last episode of season 3.

Next,  we get the shot of the painting style landscape full of bodies and  above them all stands the Attack Titan (probably Eren) reaching out with  an Armoured Titan (probably Reiner) visible behind him possibly showing  the battle in chapter 119. The Attack titan looks really demonic in  this and the imagery of it being at the top is really fitting given that  Eren has the Founding titan.

Overall,  this OP is hard to compare to the previous ones because of how  different it is. Its very aesthetically distinct and aims for different  things. Whereas previous OP's focussed more on characters and story with  Epic undertones this one seems to focus more on the horrors of war  while blending it in with propaganda that was so prevalent during this  time in our world. In terms of the song it really fits the visuals and  the theme they are going for. It seems slightly unnerving and creepy  whilst retaining a bit of the hype that characterised the previous OP's.

The Episode:

The episode was inconsistent in quality but in general very good. This section is a bit nitpicky:

The  first thing that was immediately obvious to me was Colt's ridiculous  running in the beginning, whilst not terrible in animation it just  looked a bit absurd and took me out of the episode. The new music  sounded familiar compared to earlier songs and in general fitted in very  well personally in the first section.

The  additions to the episode were I also love the added shots of the  trenches and showing how terrifying it is for the people there and how  exhausted they are. Later on in the episode I also liked the addition of  suicide bombers to hammer home how brutally Marley treats Eldians. The  scene with the soldier climbing over corpses also really helps to  establish the mood of the season.

One  thing that stuck out to me in a good way was surprisingly the animation  on Gabi's foot when she is unattaching the grenade, everything flowed  so well and it looked really natural. I appreciate that MAPPA also kept  the midroll information sheets  as well as the episode number cards and  to be continued card.

Occasionally  it was obvious that they were obscuring peoples mouths to cut down on  the ammount of time they were needing to animate but overall the still  frames were good. Upon watching it again the CGI used for certain things  has grown on me especially with the armoured train and the arial shot  of the Fort. The CGI with Cart and Jaws was surprisingly good although  not as amazing as they were in the trailer. The both of them themselves  were hard to tell apart from their hand drawn counterparts and the only  thing that caught me onto realising they were CG was their movement.  MAPPA really did the titan bombardment scene justice, also the lack of  censorship was interesting given that it is airing on the same network  as last season.

Probably my  biggest problem with the episode was Armoured and Beast titans CGI, in  itself the CGI was actually passable but transitioning between shots was  terrible. The speed at which the action happens makes it hard to tell  what is happening sometimes so it doesn't help that both the beast and  armoured land, and then are presented in massively different ways. For  example, the beast comes down from the sky in a t-pose style before  transitioning in the very next frame to having his manga pose of hand  reached out to the ground with another behind pointed to the sky. Also  the beast's face looks really uncanny valley even compared to his style  in WIT.

Finally, the blend between  the beast throwing the shells to the naration to the scene with Jean  was so smooth and well executed. The last scene especially was really  well done and gives me a lot of hope for the festival scenes, it looked  exactly how I would have expected a good WIT adaptation to look but with  a depth of field blur added. I understand why some people might be  against Jean's appearance but for the casual viewer if they are able to  surmise his identity it will give them some hope of returning to their  main cast and to the ones that don't guess who he is it adds in that  mystery that drove seasons 1 through 3.

Overall,  the episode was a 9/10 which is better than I expected although it  leaves a bit of room to be desired. The backgrounds and character  designs were consistent, well presented and detailed which I loved. The  additions give me hope for a more fleshed out world and the pacing was  perfect. Whilst the worst thing was obviously the CGI, I believe that as  long as the quality remains consistent they will grow on me and get  better.

The ED:

Obviously  we have only seen the last part of the ED so it is possible that there  are things in the first part that indicate different things.

The  ED it starts with falco standing infront of a wall (possibly one on  Paradis) with birds flying in the background, these are probably just  part of the general bird symbolism in the series.

Then  images appear behind him showing general images of the battle and we  get a closeup of his face probably to show how the fighting impacted  him. The title of the ed ""shock"" probably relates into this as Falco to  some extent is suffering shell shock or something similar, a relatively  common thing in WW1 for soldiers to get.

It  goes on to show Falco closing his eyes and thinking of a phoenix flying  obviously in reference to his dream before it explodes into a ball of  light. out of which many string like effects appear. I believe these to  be a representation of paths, they make up the body of the phoenix after  all. We then see Ymir with the paths tree behind her and you can see  the paths coming off it, I love the pan up here and the slow growing of  the tree.

We then see the screen  fill with the paths and then they are condensed down into a sphere that  Falco grabs, in reference to him gaining the power of the titans, before  finally the scene where Falco reaches out to a bird.

Overall  the ED is great, breathtaking song and stunning visuals although it,  like the OP, is very distinct from the other ED's it probably overall my  2nd favorite ED behind Season 2's.",gev22nh,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 20:22:52,9,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

The guns and ships are understandable but it was kinda a letdown to see that all the shifters are cgi, especially since they were 2d in all previous seasons and 2d in the trailer Mappa put out back in May

Don't get me wrong, I think the CGI animation looked incredible (with the exception of the beast titan and some shots of the Jaws, which hopefully will get better as the episodes come out) but I'm sure if we all had the option, we'd all want them to be 2D

I'm just curious on why they made the change, why they showed one thing in the trailer and then did the complete opposite for the actual show

It makes me a bit worried about some of the upcoming anticipated fights like Eren v War Hammer or the Attack on Paridis, fights which I feel like won't be as impactful if they have clunky CGI, even if just a bit",gewe6au,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 02:53:27,5,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Plot: It's Attack on Titan... Of course it's a 10/10! Seriously though, for an introductory episode, it began the season with hype. (Since it's in the manga, I will leave it at that.)

Art/Animation: I really do not like CGI, but S4E01 did CGI much better than I expected. Still, the CGI feels unnatural, especially in an anime like AoT. I really hope they animate Eren vs WHT well, preferably without CGI. I was expecting something closer to the trailer (where I didn't notice any CGI, or at least I don't remember any). I'm not for or against Mappa's art style. Art/Animation: 7/10.

Music: I noticed they reused some of the music from the trailer. This is not a complaint though. That was some dope music. 8/10, no complaints.

The opening was beautiful and perfectly captures the dark and somewhat mysterious vibe of the Marley and Rumbling arcs. I cannot wait to see EREH!!!!

Edit: I also love that in the end of the opening, they clearly show Eren's Attack Titan, being followed by some titans. I wonder what that symbolizes ;)",gew9zt9,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 02:14:22,13,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,wrathandweeping,"Things I liked:

- 2D animation : some sequences, like the bird flying to the port while Gabi gave her recap, or Reiners transformation, were amazing — detailed, immersive, fluid, gorgeous 
- 3D animation: honestly, most of it. Very fluid and well blended 
- added scenes / changes: I didn’t love the 1:1 panel adaptation from Wit. Respectful but can be boring as a manga reader. Cool they changed/added some things while honoring the source material 
- hearing some old AOT music 
- the washed out color palette. Hated it in the PV, but grew on me here once I accepted no longer seeing WIT’s striking, vibrant colors 
- opening and ending. I love abstract art, and I love weird typography. Cool how the text appears and disappears asymmetrically throughout, and always respect trying something different 

Things I disliked:
- the blur. Was hoping that was a trailer only thing. Just rewatched hoping I was mistaken, but damn. It flattens everything — even when the shading and motion is dynamic and conveys depth. At the very least the filter setting is too high and constant. As a digital artist I lean on blur to soften my mistakes sometimes... but seems like it’s always on. Honestly gives me a headache 
- Direction. Everything is fluid and realistic, which is cool, but — too much so. MAPPA doesn’t let the frames pause and breathe to give dramatic weight or let us appreciate designs, entrances, twists, etc. Blink and you miss it; gone is that anime stylization that really slows down the action to emphasize specific moments and make them “epic”
- new OST. Im sorry but I hate it. Generic strings brass instruments etc. Old OST blended those components with crazy electronic stuff and Gregorian chants and all other kinds of weirdness and catchy melodies... this is much more lazy and cliche. 
- too much CGI. MAPPA’s CGI is dope, and blows WIT’s out of the water. But WIT only used theirs sparingly: colossal, horses, roof tiles, etc. Seems like it’s used with every shifter, even during still frames / close ups, although these don’t quite happen anymore due to the direction issue noted above. 

Overall: pumped. Even tho the audiovisual aesthetic of S1-3 was probably my favorite aspect of the show, and I do consider this inferior with respect to my personal tastes... I really do appreciate MAPPA stepping up and giving it their all, and I did enjoy this.

My guess is they decided to use CGI on titans considering the amount of titan scenes they'll have to do in the future and they didn't want to switch from hand-drawn to CGI all of a sudden in the middle of the season, I'm ok with that.

Then there's this issue of CGI not blending with the background, the titan fps being choppy in some shots etc. I'm sure at least some would agree it was very weird. I haven't watched other shows from MAPPA but I guess I can attribute this to studio's characteristic style, so this is also ok.

There's the part in the trailer where Galliard jumped on soldiers after bending the rail with his Jaw, they removed the pouncing part for some reason, though I'm glad he was masterfully represented as this fast feral frontliner.

Also there's Cart's first scene, they changed that shot a bit and it's generally fine but the angle is so weird for some reason. The trailer angle was definitely better imo.

Reiner with his gunnars looked badass.

Like, half the episode had this epic combat music, which kind of lost its effect by the end. Keep in mind though that I am being very nitpicky here.

Opening was very unorthodox, but I kinda like it. The ending on the other hand was fucking fantastic. Like, holy hell, that shit bangs. 

The average WIT episode was like an 8.5-9.0 / 10.

This episode was a strong 7 / 10.

So not bad by any margin, just, the quality drop was a bit too noticable.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,MaulVader2,"That was... a wild ride.

First, let's get the minor complaint out of the way, obviously, the CGI Titans. Now, I didn't dislike them, the models are very high quality and I can only imagine how it looks in HD, but it'll take some time to get used to. I just hope that some key scenes like Eren's transformation during the Declaration of War are hand-drawn, since there's not much movement from his titan (the battle with the WH will obviously be CG, that I don't mind).

Besides that, I think the episode looks great. The pacing is perfect, I don't think they cut any lines from the manga, the movement is fluid, the character designs are extremely detailed and the VA's all did an amazing job! Unlike some, I quite liked the opening, it was a risk doing an op without any characters, but I think it payed off, it really sits well with the theme of the Marley Arc. The ending is great as well and I think that Falco is gonna have a far more important role in the resolution of the story then we may think.

Overall, fucking great episode, props to Mappa for putting this much effort into it.",geubpqt,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 16:56:31,4,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

But damn, I don't know the difference between good or bad CGI, is it blended well enough in the background or not, I am no professional but I can only tell that CGI is not something I like in general, and it looks incredibly stiff for me. 

And i'm just so disappointed seing how bad my boys Reiner and Zook look. Especially since all of their scenes in titan form are CGI. 

I mean when there is a lot of movement, the CGI isn't that bad and can be well integrated. But every fucking frame. There were so many still images that could have been 2D.

 And yes this is definetely a downgrade from WIT. Only the colossal and Rod were CGI, and tbh it wasn't too much of a bother since when there were 2D characters involved in the scene, the colossal was also drawn in 2D (like the scene Bertholdt kindapps Eren, the image where we see his hand holding eren, it is a 2D titan hand) while in this episode, even Monke's hand, zoomed in, when he grabs the missiles, is 3D. 

They could have at least tried to blend 2D animation within the 3D ones, especially for the still frames. 
Especially for the main  titan characters. I mean, the bombarding of titans from the plane had plenty of 2D titans, while our most important titan shifters looked like they came from a (bad) video game cutscene. 

I guess this was a way for us to get used to the CGI in order to prepare us for the rumbling, but i wouldn't have cared less if only the colossals in the rumbling looked CG while all the other episodes and other titans were 2D. I can't imagine Eren or Warhammer titan looking 3D. Or Grisha's titan in the flashbacks, or even Ymir's titan. All these important and amazing scenes will lack life and loose all impact on the watcher (or at least for me) if they are CG. 

That's just my opinion , I know you're all trying to stay positive and see the good in this new season, I was having hope too and trusted that SNK will be in good hands with MAPPA. I really tried, but I've lost all hype. 

I think everything looked good, the seiyuus were incredible as usual, the ost were perfect, the op and ed were good, but the fights, wich are so important in this season, looked so dull and childish for me. I felt no impact when stuff was thrown at titans, no feeling of everything being so small and vulnerable near the giant and creepy titans who fight in a war. I felt so many more emotions while reading the manga, and I feel like these CGI titans don't pay a nice tribute to Isayama's godly titan drawings. 
Especially since the animated version of a manga is supposed to give it life, these fights seemed dead to me, and i felt more life reading the scans compared to this. 

I am not trying to shit on MAPPA or anything, I believe they are giving it their best, and are taking it very seriously, it just isn't working for me. 

I'll miss the times everything was 2D, even the new Ghibli movie is a 3D one, I am at a loss of words. For me, animation looks most beautiful, fluid and natural when 2D. I know it's harder and takes a lot more time, but it's definetely worth it.
I wouldn't have mind if I had to wait a couple more years to watch SNK entirely animated by hand.",gewxe0b,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-07 06:05:15,18,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False
Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,Wail-D,"Anyone else kind of disappointed about the first episode? Most of my anime only friends I watched it with enjoyed it (though they did have a few critiques). I personally felt like I hyped myself a bit too much. Like when the titans were parachuted down I was anticipating some epic sakuga but was thoroughly disappointed afterwards. When Gabi fell and did her throwing thing I expected the camera to follow the grenades and zoom out as the explosion happened (not saying I didn't like the anime version of that scene though)  


And at first, the slight usage of CGI was fine, I think the first 5 times they used CGI it actually looked good but then during the fighting it just felt off and not as impactful. Mainly because the music was also just... not hitting those key moments, the music was more so for a ""holy shit everything is happening at once"" moment but there wasn't all that much happening.  


To give the anime credit: I really liked Gabi's voice actress, so I'm really hyped to see her continuing and I'm honestly still hopeful they'll do the Marley invasion justice. But we can only hope...",gevnnv9,k7uh31,titanfolk,2020-12-06 22:59:06,7,1,,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

Some people said that isayama might have forgotten to add it then, but that seems a bit odd to me. Also the split at chapter 122 would be perfect to make the part after that different... In the Manga, during the rumbling Connie said something like ""how could we get to this end?"" so that kinda implicated an alternate ending to me.. I don't know, I don't have real proof. But everything about eren would fit into that idea. I think the Manga happens first, and the anime is after that. It seems as if eren tried different things to solve the Paradis problem, but nothing worked, so when he can, he goes with the rumbling (he said something like ""because you're here, I now have this path"" to zeke). Maybe the anime is a loop even after that, with another additional happening, giving him another path? The ending was so focused on Falco and I don't see any reason for that when looking at the Manga. So, theory: Falco will eat eren for some reason in the anime (eren probably will know about how useful it would be to get eaten by Falco), and that's why Falco has the flashback to survey corps. He didn't have that in the Manga so at the end of the Manga, he will not eat eren. That would be a time-line where Falco does not gain the ability to see through time and manipulate it. So eren will learn something during Manga timeline that makes him believe getting eaten by Falco might solve something, so in the next loop, the anime, he tries that.

Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,NephilimAura,"Overall, I feel this episode was an above-average re-introduction into the SnK series but overall underwhelming. I have high hopes that episodes to follow will only get better.  
  
I don't like the art style a lot. It's good but I think it's a bit contrasting to how the earlier SnK seasons were drawn. The dirt and ground, the character portraits, and the CGI all are things that stood out to me as things that I don't like a lot and things that I find are a break from the previous art style.  
  
Regarding the CGI: It's average. I wouldn't give it above average or below average. It's stiff and the shadowing isn't perfect but it still fits into the show neatly, to the point where most viewers I'm sure don't look at it as something that stands out from the episode.   
  
That said, I am disappointed that CGI was used, especially when we were handed a trailer that didn't use CGI. Why set up false expectations and lie to the viewers? We all love SnK here and the first episode is going to come out, regardless of what trailer was released. Maybe they ran into some budgeting or other challenges but regardless - I'm one of those ""don't like CGI"" folks.  
  
The CGI looked stiff at times and although it was a step up from the Colossal Titan CGI, it's still not an approach many of us enjoy. I don't like CGI and feel confident that, if the artists took drew things by hand, they would have been able to accomplish good art too. We had an epic Eren-Reiner fights, Eren-Annie fights, and Levi-Zeke fights - mostly drawn by hand, so I don't buy the excuse that ""they wouldn't have been able to pull it off in Marley."" The SnK directors have shown that they are more than capable of pulling of epic fights with hand-drawn illustrations.
  
Moving on:  
  
* Falco dreaming about a bird, waving a sword around is cool but I think unnecessary. It seems like that foreshadowing was just shoved in. There's enough foreshadowing to go around as is, and I hope the direction isn't to shove more foreshadowing like that into character lines because they don't feel there's enough already.  
  
* Gabi blowing up the train was lame. Honestly, are you going to tell me, from an enemy army point-of-view, you're just going to watch an enemy girl crawl up a mountain, without investigating, firing back, or doing anything else aside from gossiping to one another? Especially in war, when people don't exactly act rationally? Sure, I get it - they retaliated with gunfire, but the whole ""let's watch this unknown girl who has something strapped to her leg walk up to a key point of our base, and not do anything"" doesn't seem realistic at all.  
  
* Zeke's intoxicated Titan-bombs(the people in the plane) really didn't feel as big in the Anime than it did in the Manga. They didn't even really looked intoxicated; they looked paralyzed and scared. It felt like, because they were dropped off the plane so quickly, it didn't send a message about war or using civilians as warfare - which I felt was more powerful in the Manga. Even in the trailer, it seemed that scene was going to be given more weight, but it didn't really have it.  
  
Overall, I'm glad SnK is back, but I have high expectations for this season, and higher expectations for future episodes. Many of us were already saying that the new SnK season is going to beat out the other anime for the top spot of highest ratings. I'm still in high hopes for that, but the first episode has dramatically lowered these hopes... especially since the first ep is often supposed to be the one that catches attention.

Get ready for good ass sakuga shots and 2D titans . Rumbling might still be CG .

Cheese_Boi_69,holloheaded,"it's not that time is slower there, it's that the realm of the coordinate is outside of time.  that's the whole reason the paths work like they do.  it's the same reason the attack titan can see future memories.  every instance of time is accessible at any moment via the coordinate, similar how you can pick out any frame in a movie or jump in wherever you want.  the difference being that instead of existing in a ""frames per second"" fashion, time has literally infinite divisions and can't be divided into basic instances because those instances could be infinitely divided and so on and so forth.  

the way the titan building works is ymir sees in one instance that a shifter is going to transform, so she builds their titan and then sends it to them through paths into that moment in time, but since that instance is basically just a ""frame"" (again ""frame"" is a generalization of the idea of an instance of time) of time it seems like an instant to the shifter who exists within the dimensions of time.

just to hypothesize on the nature of the realm of the coordinate a bit more there are a couple of ways that things can take place there without a flow of time.

one is that there is a localized, linear passage of time in the realm of the coordinate because if there were no passage at all then nothing could take place and everything would be frozen in one instance making movement impossible and preventing pretty much anything from existing there unless it was placed by an even more extradimensional being/force.

another way is that whatever exists in the realm of the coordinate \*appears\* to have a physical makeup but is actually composed of something that can function without the flow of time to allow it to persevere.  in my opinion this isn't the case in attack on titan because the titans are very much physical creations.  obviously there's room for infinite theoretical exceptions like the titans being just ""blueprints"" that are then manifested into a physical form once they arrive in the physical world but that applies to any theory.

my opinion is that this is the way it works in aot: in a fictional world like this one you can say that a person, place or thing exists in adherence to our universes laws of physics while still outside of time and just allow them to move through and affect their environment freely while while doing so.  in reality that is impossible, but fiction comes along with concessions and at a certain point no one cares.

in any of those cases however, ymir has been in the realm of the coordinate a finite amount of time.  an unimaginably long time, but a finite one.  however, depending upon how things play out she could very well end up there for eternity.",hvwqwq5,slxcm6,attackontitan,2022-02-07 06:20:05,27,3,hvuqv32,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

You can argue that it's simply best not to think about it.


Or, it you really are bothered by the grandfather paradox assume that going back in time changes the future. Events play out, someone effects the past (making it so that things play out differently), in that new future someone changes the past, and on an fon until you eventually get a past and future that match.

Ngl i feel bad for eren even tho he is the ""bad guy"" here. He values his friends and people on paradis so much that he doesnt care that he only has 4 years left, he just wants to die knowing that his friends and the others will be safe and this time we saw the lengths that eren would go( self mutilation) and we even saw that eren still has emotions when we saw him cry (probably because he realizes that innocent people will have to die if they can't make peace)

Then you think ""titans are mindless animals though so there has to be someone or something controlling them"" and as soon as you're told that the Founding Titan can change memories then you can figure out ""oh, it's all a lie and there's humans outside the wall"". Even if you ignore the fact that Reiner keeps on going on about his war chief and HQ and Grisha was found outside the walls you can figure it out.

Even if season 4 didn't straight up tell you that the full scale Rumbling was gonna happen you can tell that it would simply because of how Eren has been portrayed.

I think your explanation is 100% correct, but I don’t really like it.
——if it’s “fixed” as you say, then what’s the point of Eren sending memories back anyways if you know what I mean.

If it’s fixed, then sending memories back or not won’t effect the future. 

At the same time, I know what you mean. Sending memories back IS part of that future and the past, it has to happen because it already has happened. 

But like, just because Eren showed Grisha some memories…that doesn’t mean he HAS TO do anything. Like I don’t see what stopped Grisha from just not feeding himself to Eren after he saw what the future looked like. I actualy find it as somewhat of a plot hole that he DOES feed himself to Eren, especially after telling Zeke to stop Eren. 

Sure, he HAS TO, as otherwise we wouldn’t be watching what we are watching rn, and Eren would never have lived this long to even send memories. But idk, it seems like a gimmicky and non sensical time travel ordeal. 

The statement that none of these guys have “free will” is stupid IMO because there truly isn’t anything stopping them from defying the memories they see excluding the fact that they see the memories themselves.

That suggests that Eren has to somehow destroy the Powers of the Attack Titan, otherwise he would also be controlled by the next wielder of that power.

Take Grisha for example. He lost two families because of him taking on the attack titan mantle along with killing many children to which he opposed. He was a tool, a pawn all because of the attack Titans power. 

Likewise the power can only send memories to the past from the future (meaning the present time attack titan could fully choose what to do with those memories) UNLESS all three are present : founding titan, royal blood in paths.

&#x200B;

Then why did he go out of his way to say he wouldnt stop moving forward no matter what ,even if the alliance tried to stop him? Why did he say in chapter 123 that he would flatten the entire world, and kill everyone outside of paradis? He was very specific about everything he said and wanted.

The only explanation to fit in your theory...was that eren didnt mean any of that and was manipulating people to hate him, so he could be stopped midway through the rumbling, which imo is character assassination for Eren. 

Even now, in chapter 137, if Eren was given the chance, i'm pretty sure he would restart the rumbling all over again.

'' What I will say, though, again, is that it might be that Eren saw it happen in future memories. Reiner's involvement, see you later, you get the gist of it. ''

He did say they were still free, so even though they’re using it’s powers, ymir / eren could be holding it back from stopping the shifters, since they have their own will that she / eren are protecting.

Matt_37,Khazu_,"Very good theory. The only thing that differs from my viewpoint is Eren dying. In my opinion he is making through it till the end. For me there are two evidence for that.

1st being Reiner not understanding Eren in terms of ""We are the same"". In war of paradis he assumed that Eren just want to die but then the looks he gives in his Titan gvies me vibe this is totally opposite. He wants to make throught it cuz off...

2nd being words of song ""Zero Eclipse"". The 1st part of the song is definitely about 104th Ymir and Historia but the 2nd part is about Eren and Historia.

In this part Historia is asking Eren that everything he has done till this points has any meaning  if he has no desire to comeback. That's why she is asking retorically if being paying for all youve done just by dying is being a Hero? the answer is...

>You're bigger

In her eyes if he doesn't come back from it alive he is zero. What's the point of doing all of it if you won't come back alive? (It would be just another Lelouch and I think it destory purpose of two lines -  ""I just keep moving forward"" ""cuz he was born into this world""). Also the hide line pretty much is perfect for what is happening right now. Literally Eren who do you hide?

>Make a promise that I cannot regret  
>  
>As long as I can see you but in secret

This is the part about their meetings in Paradis that nobody knew about. They made a promise to each other that they both won't regret. There is so much other paralels but here are already so much other posts desrcibing it so there is no reason to call it here now.

To sum it up Jean calling Eren suicidal bastard is in my opinion perfect here cuz it was like that for entire series up until chapter 90. Since then it is a total opposite. This guy will just keep moving forward and come back alive to hold his child in final panel.

You can even see Historia’s eyes spark with hope when Eren told her that he won’t sacrifice her before saying that she will do everything in her power to stop him, she never really wanted to have her children bred and killed like livestock. 

The narrative point of Zeke and Eren’s convo about Mikasa is to discuss the romantic feelings she harbours for Eren, not the ackerbond, which as we know isn’t even real.

The baby wasn’t needed for any kind of plan. Historia simply wanted to have a child (you know, like women do it irl?).

Eren has to die. Sorry yaegerbros. He's already so guilty that he's in a dream state to avoid pain of what he's doing. He simply won't be able to live a normal life if he survives this. He isn't a god. He is just a person who's dying from the inside at the thought of the atrocities he is committing. But he will die according to his own volition and plan.

Matt_37,Proxy_of_Death,"Overall, this is good stuff, just will like to expand on somethings

>Eldians are forever free from the Curse of Ymir, but they also lose their (by far) biggest military advantage. That is why Eren saw the rumbling as necessary -

I think it is likely that his plan is much more multifaceted, if not intentional then it is very effective.

First is that the rumbling could also unite the outside world and Eldians as seen in 136. This further expands on why Eren pushed his friends away and made them hate him. By not allowing the SC to take part in this Eren is the perfect scapegoat since he doesn't represent Paradis' government. So there is a way to guarantee Paradis' safety. Also, Magath.

As I have said many times this isn't Lelouch, a better reference will Ozymandias' plan for world peace in Watchmen. There are some differences though.

>And this is the part where I lose most of my yeagerbros - the real world Eren is either already dead (Gabi snipe™), or about to die.

This one I had a problem with. In 120, Zeke said to Eren _I have been waiting for so long Eren, for you to recover and awaken._ It's like I've been sitting here for a year.

So it seems Eren was rebuilt in paths likely by Ymir. Also, I don't think Eren wants to die, I don't think Ymir will let him since he is the only one she has a connection with.

>When Eren and Zeke are going on their Paths adventure, Grisha remarks to Zeke that everything is going to go Eren's way, and asks Zeke to stop Eren.

Grisha saw Zeke because Eren sent him memories of him and he even positioned himself opposite Zeke in 121 to make this possible. I think it was intentional.

Aot took it to the maximum, with just the right amount of everything.

AshiraLAdonai,Grif_the_Crit,"Depends on if you meant when it was released in general. You likely mean when the anime first aired in Japan, which I likely was busy studying about leprechaun lore and playing with paper cut outs of leprechauns.

However, I do have a pretty impactful memory from first seeing the teaser of it on Toonami I believe earlier in the week before its release on it. I may have only been around 9.5 years old but even then I knew this show would have a massive impact in not just shows but culture as well, even if I wasn't entirely obvious of such then.

After some research, I believe the date was May 1st of 2014, due to several reasons:

* The teaser I saw seemed to have been of the Toonami teaser of it, as, while my memory isn't perfect, the imagery and movements seem to be akin to how I saw them first .
* It was around when *The Cleveland Show*'s ""A Cleveland Brown Christmas"" aired around, I believe, between 9:30 PM to 10:30 PM, which was confirmed to be around 9:30 PM, though the teaser was either showed several times before and/or after that.
* The fore mention episode aired in a particular time: not only was it almost summer but it was also nearing the end of the school year, though it was a school night, I believe.

I was at one of my mom's friend's place, which had a pool we used a lot earlier so I was the only one up at the time, though I was both getting tired and bored watching the TV at the time. Then, it happened: I saw the *AOT* teaser.

Now, I had already known anime existed at the time, though I didn't know much and the only anime I had watched were some episodes of *DBZ* (The episodes that had Video vs Spopovichi, and when Gohan was about to fight but was ganged up on), the first episode of *Naruto Shipuden* and some of the *Pokemon* anime; other than that, I did not know much about the genre. *Attack on Titan* seemed... different, to say the least, from other shows, even for an anime; much darker yet had a profound feel to it.

I was shocked with how brutal it was being presented, it being a teaser and all. There was so much more gore and death than I had seen done in any other animated movie or show before. Most importantly, though, were the feelings I felt that I didn't feel from other shows. I felt a sense of dread, as if I knew there was no other option but death there, yet that also gave a sense of... moving forward, I suppose is the best way I could put it; it felt there was some room to move, rather than inevitable suffocation and being crushed by instant death. Looking back, I think I know why: there was some possibility of survival, faint and clouded by death but still a sight for freedom beyond it. I felt the desperate screaming of raw human emotion, fear but also determination. I could see Eren's rage and fight against such alien concepts. It felt... real, or rather the harsh reality of the world.

I didn't consciously think most of these then, but I remember my emotions and I can tell why I felt them, as well as some of my thoughts. What I did consciously think then, however, was that this would change media as a whole; it wouldn't just change what shows and animation could accomplish and be shown, but, in a way, society as a whole through our minds.

I didn't see any reference of it again until 3 years later at a summer camp, with one of the other cabin mates brining a volume with them. I saw and remembered the alien feelings I felt then, with the strange movements and poses of the giant, naked titans, and the brutality of death shown by not just how one was eaten but the fear and helplessness shown when being eaten.

It is safe to say it is living forever in my mind.",mnfky2o,1k0kibx,attackontitan,2025-04-16 18:24:30,1,1,,AshiraLAdonai,False

Last week I was active on the aot community & I got dm’d. My ass thought “OH, it must be someone who wants to discuss something”. I opened it & I got spoiled 2 things >;(.

War hammer being eaten & Sasha being killed. 

However, I kinda expected the war hammer to be eaten so I wasn’t as bothered. 

& with the Sasha spoiler, I kinda knew she was going to be killed cuz of that one episode she shoots the 2 guards infront of Gabi which you can see in Gabis pupil Sashas face. so I was like maybe gabi is going to kill her...? 

But still, i would’ve loved watching this episode without being spoiled. This episode hit me so imagine how hard it would’ve hit me if I didn’t know it :,(",glj83uy,l9fyq8,attackontitan,2021-02-01 00:24:22,3,2,glibft5,Sane-Ni-Wa-To-Ri,False

I think Reiner may switch sides too, or be forced to. I think it’s very apparent falco will take his Titan power. He remembered reiner’s memories in the first episode. And Reiner wants falco to have it, he’ll give it him and falco will take it knowing Reiner is ready to die

 And what do you mean ""where is the brain washing happening?"" How exactly were you expecting the brain washing is supposed to work? Did you expect Marley to strap Eldians into chairs, tape their eyes open, and force them to watch propaganda videos for hours in a dark room until their brains go numb??? Obviously the brain washing takes many forms, one of which is just like racism in real life where its built into every facet of society and effects you subconsciously, how they are mistreated, demonized, and given fake promises of redemption and rewards. Another form is generational bondage. Eldians have been born and raised since a young age to believe that they are devils for generations. It's called indoctrination. And if you are at all familiar with religions or cults, you will know it's a very hard mindset to break once its been planted in your brain.

As for Eren, have some patients and try and use a bit of critical thinking. What do you know of Eren? What are his beliefs? Do those beliefs actually align with Zeke's?

Falco, to an extent, has learned that despite his age. Why hasn't Gabi?

It doesn’t ruin the story by any means though. The only chapter of the manga that is a little below par is the last chapter (the rest are great), so proportionally, it’s really not all that much, and the best parts of attack on Titan were really just living the story with the characters and the themes that were created out of that, and none of that goes away because of the end. It wasn’t terrible, and it can only get better in the anime with the voice-acting, music, clearer action scenes and better translations (even if they don’t edit anything, which they might).

initiald-ejavu,Fabiocean,"Very well put. Apart from some assumptions I disagree with, this explains the ""hidden"" story of AoT very accurately. However, in laying these plot points bare, you exposed many things I and many others have problems with, even though you probably don't.

>The path Eren sees IS the one he will walk. He has no alternative. However, it is also exactly the path we WANTS to walk.

>Also, we know that the Founding Titan can cause tiny influences in different time periods now (such as distracting a titan away).

This is one of the biggest plotholes of 139 imo. Apparently, Eren has the ability to control any past titan (at least to a certain degree, he may have total control for all we know). I refuse to believe there was no other instance where he could have used this to get a better result than what he settled with. Bear in mind, there are endless possiblities he could explore, so a future where Sasha, Hange, his parents and many others die just for the sake of Mikasa's and Armin's survival (which wasn't even guaranteed either, by his own admission) seems far from the best option. If that really was the *only* way to save them (which wouldn't really make sense either given the infinite possible futures he can see), there should have been way more focus on that aspect.


>Eren pulled a lelouch in the ending. ""When the whole world hates me and you kill me, everyone will love each other!"" 

This is also such a stupid plan, since this would never work in this world, which also gets mentioned multiple times, and actually backfires massively in the extra pages, as you should expect. The outside world unconditionally hates Eldians, or are indifferent to them at best. After such an attack, no matter how it was circumvented, it's completely obvious that the survivors would one day retaliate. Also, if his plan was to get killed by the Alliance, why were they left in the dark about any of this? I know that it makes sense from a writing perspective, since the suspense and mystery about Eren's goals was a big part of the finale, but from an in-universe perspective, there's no reason not to let them know about this.

>she learns to get over her love of King Fritz (stockholm syndrome more like) and move on

That's another part I really hate about 139. Ymir really loved her abuser the whole time? It made sense when she was a powerless slave, it still kinda made sense after gaining titan powers, since she still was a mentally damaged child/young adult who didn't know better and probably didn't think she deserved better. However, after becoming  what basically is an omnipotent goddess with endless time to think about herself, it just seems weird that she didn't change her ways in those 2000 years. Even weirder is that somehow, Mikasa's half-baked love story made her realize the error in her ways, when nothing before could. 


>The cycle will start over again. It was completely pointless.

I'm honestly mostly indifferent to this, but I know that many people didn't line this. The futility of war and hatred gets showcased by this, even though the execution flopped hard imo, but the intent behind this wasn't that bad. The worst thing about this though, is that Eren lacked the foresight to predict any of this. *This is the path he chose*, so why does everything go to shit anyway? Some of these things were hard/impossible to predict, and since paths apparently was destroyed with Eren's death (also something we didn't get much needed closure on), he couldn't see any of it. But many things, most notably Paradis getting destroyed sooner or later and his friends potentially not surviving for long were so obviously going to happen with the outcome Eren chose, it just seems like he didn't even care what happened after his death, which contradicts everything Eren stands for.

All in all, I'm glad you laid the story open like this, so it's easier for you to see where I'm coming from. In the end, it's a matter of taste I guess.",hf5utwt,pzthco,attackontitan,2021-10-03 02:05:36,5,1,,initiald-ejavu,False

The way the panels switch between cabin-Eren and Rumbling-Eren as Mikasa kills him and kisses him goodbye was telling of the fact that they lived together in paths right around his final moments. Probably right when we see Mikasa get spirited away from the Rumbling to waking up at the cabin. 

I still believe he experienced visions beyond his death of him wrapping the scarf around Mikasa as a bird. This is why he REALLY wanted her to get rid of the scarf. He knew she was going to be there alone and grieving him years after his death still wearing it. 

But as he said, he doesnt truly know what she will do after he dies so I guess that was his last real experience chronologically with Mikasa and he never saw anything beyond that while alive with the Founder's powers.",hf42fm8,pzthco,attackontitan,2021-10-02 18:17:57,2,1,,initiald-ejavu,False

So I didn’t read ur post cuz I don’t wanna get spoiled haha. I think it’s honestly pretty simple. Aot is a STORY. With every character having their own unique motivations for doing what they do. That’s why there are no TRUE villains. There are no BAD characters. Every character is relevant to the story. 

It’s really a philosophical war. That’s why I think it’s the best anime ever made. I don’t watch anime for the action and stuff like that (even tho it’s appreciated), but for the deep meanings, symbolisms, emotions, etc. 

So I’m simply seeing aot as a story. For example, I DO think that Marley is in the wrong. I mean… in reality, king fritz was wrong of course but that’s already happened. BUT… important BUT… I don’t blame Marley. I don’t think of Marleyens as evil. Again, it’s a STORY with everyone having their own unique motivations and intentions. Imo, Marley should have broken the cycle of hate and revenge. That would’ve been the best solution. But… it is what it is… that’s just not how the story is unfolding.

When Falco first comes out from the wreckage, and we see a cgi Erin, and then immediately cut to the animated Falco, it's a little jarring, but at the same time the hand drawn Armin Titan was amazing.

I never considered this angle, and I had months to notice this as I'm a manga-reader. That's a pretty great observation.

>(unlike luffy were character pretty never evolve, even after traumatic events)

I will never understand why people view Luffy this way. Luffy's character has evolved, especially if you go back and read/watch past chapters/episodes. His core character traits didn't, and he does sometimes fall back into his bad habits, but he is a different character compared to back then. His development is just a bit more slow-paced and subtle.

A similar case of this is World Trigger (a high recommendation, by the way), where the main character, Osamu, grows slowly and subtlely throughout the series.",gkt2iaz,l5553g,attackontitan,2021-01-26 10:13:38,29,3,gkszkr5,despacito11,False

Likewise, Eren was able to talk to Grisha directly to get him to kill Frieda by sharing his own memory of that conversation (basically, Eren talks to Grisha, and then has a memory of what he said.

The kid ymir ate was marcel, the older brother of porco (the new jaw titan) marcel had the jaw titan before ymir amd when she ate him she gained the power, marcel was also the leader of the group (riener, annie, bert). the reason riener wasnt supposed to be selected is because he was the least promising of the candidates, but marcel was hyping him up in a way so that his younger brother (porco) doesnt get chosen(to protect him.)

Eren lost control because it was the second time he transformed, he regained control and doesnt seem to have lost that control since.

Riener suffers from split personality disorder, it's his other personality that misses paradise. (could be more reasons)

Eren and Riener are the same in a lot of ways, but mainly...Riener lived under his enemy's (paradise) for a time and still decided to kill them, Eren did the same thing in Marley, lived with the people and then killed them, I didnt explain this very well, it does much deeper, but that's a basic explanation.

The Military wants Erens titan...everyone wants erens titan, the founding titan is insanely powerful, we dont know too much of what it can do yet, but it is the reason Riess was able to take away memories.",grlkqi4,m8trv9,attackontitan,2021-03-20 16:53:04,2,1,,michael-james--,False

iamgoingtointernet,TyGuy223,"Dude, I'm so pumped because I totally saw this coming! Although, in my thoughts I thought they should've been doing the back stroke on the water's surface. Let me explain:

1. Titans are supposed to be less dense than humans. If humans float in water then titans definitely should, so it wouldn't make sense for them to walk along the bottom. Maybe they could give themselves some hardened titan shoes to hold them down, but that would be inefficient because of the following.
2. Wall titans have lanky arms and massive feet. Literally the best qualities of a swimmer. They should be able to swim way faster than they could ever walk.
3. Their intense heat means the water will likely instantly boil around them (as we saw) reducing friction and allowing them to swim that much faster.
4. I thought the back stroke could make the most sense if the titans were unable to submerge themselves because of their buoyancy, because then their napes would be more protected from shelling and bombs. Obviously this would be ridiculous, but it was a fun idea to throw around.

We were rooting for him. But then the Manga ended just the same and it had us heartbroken. Eren Yeager, a character that I had been rooting for since I was eleven years old died in a wholly uncharacteristic way. The ending was completely botched and I gave up on the series. Then I saw Season 4 release and started paying attention, if only to see the Anime Onlies rage just as I had. Then it got split up and I slowly backed out until I saw Satal and the rest of the crew. they all got me to hope that Yama was a genius and that the anime would end differently just as MuvLuv did. And then Cour 2 happened and I was pissed. He knew the reaction to the ending was bad, but went through with it anyway? It makes no sense to me, so much so that I can only chalk it up to Japanese Stubbornness. 

Cour 2 was action packed and absolutely phenomenal save those final twenty minutes. If they had ended the story at the Fall of the Walls then I feel that it would've been the best spot to end it.

Was it the many lucky things that happened:

- Falco being the only know titan shifter with functional wings, and him knowing how to use them with perfection + being able to shift multiple times without seeming fatigue?

- Armin being captured, not insta killed by Ymir even though we know she wanted to destroy humanity and killing Armin would guarantee that? 

-Armin being sent to the Paths for reasons… to connect with Zeke to resurrect the past titan shifters?

Was it the squandered pay offs:

-The conflict never ends being a terrible way to sign off the show, teasing a new start to the titan powers and showing the infinite birth and rebirth of paradis

-The honorary marleyans reuniting with Annie, Reiner, Gabi and Falco to be ruined by them turning into pure titans (which by the way, was totally inconsequential because they reverted back to human almost minutes later with no detriment) 

-Was it the Commander of Fort Slava saying he’ll never treat Eldians with unjust hatred, only to them begin to perpetuate that hatred again after they revert back to humans? 

- Was it Zeke being killed off by Levi despite having realised his errors of killing so many people? Wouldn’t it have been so much more rewarding and interesting if he decided to help humanity because he wants to cherish life after his conversation with Armin? 

Was it the stupid decisions of the characters:

-Why did Eren kill 80% of the world’s populations? To prevent revolt? 

Congratulations, the Jaegeriists are now the most powerful military force on the planet and will continue to kill everyone outside of Paradis.

Why 80%? Why not 20/10/1? That would’ve been enough to showcase the power of the titans. 

- Why did Eren kill his own mother? To save bertholdt so Armin can get the colossal? Why not just send it away m, turn it around and save his mum? That would’ve worked 

-Eren can go into the past and change the future seemingly. So why the fuck would he not cut it off at the source? Why go through the measures to commit mass genocide? 

Was it the many things that make absolutely 0 sense:

- How did Mikasa know Eren was in the Titans mouth? 

-How can Eren turn into a colossal titan after being separated from the parasite, if that’s the founder? Or is Ymir the founder? Fuck knows 

-Mikasa being chosen to end the cycle of hatred because of love for Eren, like Ymir loved Fritz? What? That’s loose and doesn’t hold 

-Why choose Mikasa after 2000 years to free her from her love from Fritz? Why? How? 

-Why did Ymir allow the reawakening of the past titan shifter? 

-Rumbling stops because Zeke dies, Eren loses contact with royal blood. But what about S2? Eren touches Dina’s hand for a split second and he can control titans for long after that?

-What happened to the parasite thing after Eren dies? You never see it again? 

-The absolute clusterfuck of death baiting. 

It’s loose, bad and is full of lucky consequences to make things happen.",k7x19gh,17ntbm9,attackontitan,2023-11-05 13:17:05,3,3,k7wxa2j,Abhinav6singg,False

Once war was declared all bets were off, there were always going to be civilian casualties that's just war.

I think what marley has done is wrong, they have used Eldians as weapons and judge them for their past. I dont know the truth about what Eldians have done. But i do know that in this time they are innocent.

To The point: Either way, all humans have suffered from titans in the past. Thats why they need to put a stop to all founding titans. Theres no way Eren would do something like keeping everyone from having children. It all seems kind off sketchy but Zeke needed to escape being eaten and Eren needed to lure Marley to paradis thats why they did all the things they had to do. 

By luring them to paradis, all the founding titans are all in one place, so Eren and Zeke are going to put an end to everything. They dont care who is in the right or wrong.

Eren is going to fight and eat all founding titans passed down for generations and sacrifice himself so noone can inheriate it again. So if im right the ending is going to be a ""sacrifice your life to become the hero of the world ending"". That also explains why Eren is trying to make Mikasa and Armin hate him, so he has no obstacles for his plan.

A common theme in the series is how the perception of who's good/bad or right/wrong depends on the perspective and background you've been given up until that point. That's one of the reasons a lot of people are empathizing more with Zeke after the last episode.

The fact still remains though that the world has demonized the Eldians, and the only obvious way to free them from that persecution is to rise up against Marley. Tbh I'm not even sure the rest of the world hates the Eldians like the Marleyans do. Like when Marley gathered the rest of the nation before the declaration of war? Seemed to me they were trying to convince and be sure that the rest of the world would side with them in the conflict.

What if Grisha was right about wanting Eren to be the savior of the Eldians? I'd say the big question is whether or not Eren's will is gonna waver. The Jaegerists are behind Eren because they believe him to be the only one capable of making the tough decision to wage war with Marley despite the fact that there will be a lot of collateral damage/death.

However, you are correct that Mikasa says 'itteraishai,' which is a word considered as equivalent to 'have a nice journey' in Japanese. 'Itteraishai' is generally said as a formula that responds to 'ittekimasu;' 'I am leaving.' It's often used in daily situations where people in the same family/house are separating to go to work. That's why to can also be translated as 'see you later,' as this formula implies that the persons involved will find each other at the end of the day/end of the trip - so it still works :)",gm8028s,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-06 12:15:31,25,2,gm6rojt,emmyeggo,True

If it was 1 for 1 it would be a code, not a different language. If you translate anything more than a couple words long you are almost guaranteed to have different translators provide different translations.

Translations are so very frequently riddled with errors. They don't ""have the most time to fix"" things. They have the chance to fuck it up.

The translation of anything is NEVER the ""official"" version. The only thing that could ever be the official version is something that is written and checked by the original author in a language they understand and are extremely fluent in. 

I cannot stress this enough. Translations are filled with errors. I don't know where you got the perception that you can trust the translations more than the originals. Because the reality is the exact opposite.

Shows NEVER ""fix"" things in a translation. They don't change story points intentionally for translations. They don't intentionally change what people say based on which language of release.

The purple flowers are known as bellflowers (Hananira).

- The purple flowers appear in both WIT and MAPPA's adaptation. We can even see purple petals when Eren enters paths and recalls the episode 1 memory reanimated by MAPPA.
- The purple flowers are used in promoting merchandise for Mikasa.
- Purple flowers (Saintpaulias in this case) appear in Muv-Luv (the series that inspired Isayama to make AOT). Muv-Luv mentions in floriography Saintpaulias mean "" a delicate love.""
- Yuki Kaji mentioned bellflowers (Hananira) symbolise ""a sad farewell and enduring love"".
- The flowers appear only in scenes where Mikasa and Eren are present. In this scene Eren defends Mikasa by transforming.
- Kaji then mentions the date the flowers were founded..... which was February 10th. The same date as Mikasa's birthday.

LightThatIgnitesAll,StealMyIdentity,"Hey! Thanks for clarifying some of this. Like I said, I don't intend for anything here to be taken as law, just offering some insights from someone at the very bottom of this process. I appreciate you expanding on Isayama and Araki's relationship in particular because I couldn't really find anything about this online.

I think you are misunderstanding some of my other points though. Starting from the bottom up:

* Yeah, of course. Criticism isn't in itself bad, harassment is.
* Of course it was popular from the start- and frankly it was popular most notably with people who had no experience with the manga. This being the problem in itself. Harassment of WIT employees continued until the very end of the anime, however, and the side-eye towards the anime was ongoing well into season 2. That's really what I'm talking about.
* Yep, that's true. I was really talking about the ramp-up pre-production period for WIT's take, not the independent schedule for each season. To further clarify, I'm not saying that Kodansha's specifications for the anime were new just for season 4. It just clearly become a problem that terminated in WIT dropping out.
* Like I said this is the part I wasn't sure of. I couldn't really find much information to substantiate this- not that I'm saying what you're saying isn't true. I was curious about where this was coming from however and still am.
* I think that probably a lot of what can be said how each part of the anime was perceived is probably relative to what circles you've hung around, so I will admit that my presentation of facts may be a bit skewed. Most of the reception I've been able to pull from is from Japanese fans, which honestly tends to be a bit different than US fans. What I'm referring to as ""peak 進撃の巨人"" is the final few episodes of s3, which seemed to exhibit higher budget allocation. I would disagree it's the weakest season visually as well, but that is consistent with the timeline problem.
* This is very much an opinion thing. You're only looking at their big, successful anime when I'm talking about the bredth of their very limited field of work. But I can agree that they are *very* good at bringing emotional energy to their work. But MAPPA not being able to produce emotionally charged work? Absurd. *Kids on the Slope* is the quintessential music anime IMO. *Terror in Resonance* captures the fear and existential dread of terrorism amazingly. I don't really need to defend *Yuri!!! on Ice* as I know opinions are subjective there, but it was great. (except for the reused footage on the skating segments) *Inuyashiki* captures the frustration and dread of growing old as well as being imbued with power. *Banana Fish* is an extremely powerful portrayal of guilt, PTSD and the horrors of the world of crime. That's off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more examples.

Most importantly, my whole entire point *really* is not to pit these two studios against one another. I think both studios do great work and have occasional misses. It happens. I'm not going to go to the wall for either of them though.",hv5zmpj,shzamr,titanfolk,2022-02-01 19:34:52,3,2,hv5w7mv,StealMyIdentity,True

I'll try to reword my point about the jail scene. I'm glad he used the Warhammer there, I defnitely agree that it's cooler than him just being let out by Jeagerists.

My main changes would be to take out Eren killing his mom (total BS and betrayal, not even going to rework it), and to rework founder Ymir's motivations and resolution—which would also entail giving Historia a real role in the story again, changing the nature of the worm, etc. Also (speaking of Historia) I felt killing off Ymir Freckles so soon, and in that manner, was a waste and a disservice to her character; that's really the only major pre-timeskip change I would make, though I haven't thought out all the details on how I would do it (and frankly I don't think I care enough about the story anymore to work that out completely).",k7vrfm6,17njuxw,titanfolk,2023-11-05 04:20:45,2,1,,Bayro1997,False
Bayro1997,ABuddhistMelomaniac,"I would've done two different things for the ending, in fact, I always thought this was how it was gonna end:


1 -Eren accidentally kills everyone (except Armin). He also kills Mikasa in, probably, one of the most ironic and shocking ways possible: by accidentally having Mikasa's scarf (the scarf that Eren gave her and symbolizes her love for him) getting stucked on one of Eren's titan's bony arms (or fingers), choking her or breaking her neck as a consequence. THIS (killing everybody and Mikasa) could've been one of the memories he saw when he kissed Historia and the one thing he wanted to prevent, THAT'S WHY he wanted Mikasa to hate him, so that she would abandon the scarf and PREVENT HER BRUTAL DEATH. That would give Eren's confrontation with Armin and Mikasa (the part where he says he hates her) A LOT MORE PURPOSE and meaning, same with Eren's conversation with Louise telling her to get rid of it (which backfires as Louise ideolizes Mikasa and decides to keep it, making it come back to Mikasa). It always got my attention how the scarf would somehow always return to Mikasa, as if everything was a sick play (as in theatrical play) of fate itself.

2 - This event creates dread, pain and a lot of suffering for both Armin and Eren. Eren decides to send his memories (a scene we haven't even been shown but we know that he did) to other titan shifters, especially Karl Fritz, another attack titan user, Grisha, Falco, and his (Eren's) past self, but not with the intend to fulfill his fate, but to STOP him from even being born. He first sends his memories to Karl Fritz, who goes mad and misinterpets Eren's memories as a divine warning, he misinterpets Eren's and Zeke's titans as ""Devils of the Earth"" and Historia as ""Christa""/Ymir, giving rise to the myth of the Devil of the Earth. He sees these ""devils"" fighting for the Founding Titan to destroy the Earth (but he doesn't see how it's gonna be destroyed). He does see the colossal titans and people migraring to an island in Eren's memories but misinterprets them as a way to prevent the devils (Eren and Zeke) from finding the founder: that being by selling half of the Eldians to Marley, exiling himself to Paradis, creating the walls with the colossals (so that the ""devils of the Earth"" would never find it) and creating the ""Cult of the Walls"". The people from Marely, however, noticed his strange change in personality and decide to capture Karl Fritz (before devising his plan of course) and torture him so that he would reveal what he knows (Marely would be destroyed in 1000 years). This also prompts Marely to request Karl Fritz and Tybur's aid during the Titanomachy, contributing to the capture of all the other titans except the Attack Titan (as he was hiding) in exchange for his liberty. I took inspiration from Greek mythology. You see, in Greek mythology we have the Titans and the Olympian Gods. Among them, you have the titan prometheus and the God Zeus. These are enemies, however, Prometheus (Karl Fritz) helps Zeus (Marely) to win their Titanomachy only if Zeus spared his life, making him (Prometheus) betray his titan brothers by putting them against one another. Prometheus (same as Karl Fritz) also can see into the future (his name literally means ""forethought"") and he sees Zeus' own downfall and how one of his children dethrones him. Zeus captures and tortures him until he tells him who is the one child who would dethrone him, making Zeus also go after his own children to murder them, except for one child he didn't even know he had (which, as expected, was the one who would dethrone him).

That's right baby, Eren sends his memories to Karl Fritz to prevent his own birth, but by doing that, Karl created the conditions (the segregation of Eldians, Paradis and the walls) that brought both Zeke and Eren to life (as well as their motivations). Also, having Karl Fritz seeing Eren's memories would explain where the legend of the world leaders fighting a common powerful enemy (the one told by Pixie) came from, as well as Uri and Frieda knowing about judgement day (cause they receive the memories from their ancestor Karl Fritz, which he got FROM THE FUTURE/EREN). This would also explain WHY they (Mareley and his troops) waited for ONE THOUSAND years before attacking Paradis island and retrieve the founder, cause they knew about their imminent doom and had a better understanding of Karl's ""prophetic"" warning.

Bayro1997,shrekman68,"Addressing your 15th problem, eren's didn't have to be said for probably the hundredth time in the story. If people expected something else, their expectations ruined their perception of the ending. 

My interpretation of the Ymir and Mikasa situation is that Ymir was a slave. She has never experienced receiving or  conveying true love. She yearned to experience love, but it wasn't really the case with King Fritz. When she saw Mikasa let go of Eren and her love for him, it showed that Ymir could do the same. The scene showing Ymir hugging her daughters instead of sacrificing her life to save King Fritz shows how she truly loved her daughters and descendants, leading to her erasing the titans.

My memory is a little foggy, but Eren said that the past, future, and present existed at the same time for him. I don't think it's a stretch for him to be able to control pure titans from the past.

The ""Ten years at least"" scene may have been jarring, but given the situation, I would say it's appropriate for Eren to be acting like that. He was holding in his emotions for so long, only to finally be able to let it all out in the presence of his best friend moments away from his death.

Everyone being emotional afterward shows how big empathy as a theme is in the story. That's also why everyone accepted reiner. They still considered him a friend and understood him enough to be emotional about his death.

The ending wasn't pointless just because Beren was hinted to have started the titan curse again. That's the point of the story. It hints to even more conflict occurring in the future, that along with the bombing of paradis. I doubt there will be a sequel.

This may sound dumb given the fact that I have no idea how going back the original universe works, so please be kind - but wouldn't it be interesting if the  characters were given the choice of whether they want to leave or not?

If OP's theory is correct, Eren has been working hard to fulfill his promise of killing everyone (which is what's likely going to end their deal and let him go back) so that he *AND* his friends that he so deeply loves can go back ""home"". 

But what if they don't want to?

I imagine that if they (they being Armin, Jean and Connie...I'm not sure where Mikasa stands in this respect) were to find out about how all this was the result of Eren's wish out of boredom and that the AOT universe would still exist once they left, them being the Scouts, wouldn't go with him. Or at the very least, it would be painful for them to. 

I love this theory, but I think it would also be interesting to see them given the choice to leave or stay and be distraught about choosing the easier side of leaving and forgetting, rather than them just disappearing into the orig universe like in muv luv. 

Imagine the heart-wrenching drama! If they leave, they don't have to remember the pain. They get to see Sasha, Marco - their families and friends, alive and well. 

But this also means that all these people in the post rumbling world will continue to exist and bear the consequences of their actions. It would align w most of their character arcs to stay, and even be consistent with the recent character deaths; they'd all give up on their dreams and die. Jean wanted the opportunity to have a happy family, live in comfort; Armin too because then he'd be giving up on his dreams and dying since he doesn't get to see that other world lol; Connie doesn't get to see his family again; this could even conclude Mikasa's arc (mind you, I'm aware I'm slightly biased, if only because I'd be more satisfied in the gut-punch kind of ending where Mikasa lets Eren go rather than them ending up together, so take this w a grain of salt) where she lets go of Eren and doesn't get to stay by his side forever *and* it's her own choice (i'm here for Pain). This discussion could even be part of that final EMA confrontation we're all waiting for! 

It's a very Those Who Walk Away From Omelas kind of moral dilemma and tbh that'd make up for the ""and it was all a dream"" effect of suddenly making a different universe. 

The ending where they all choose to stay can also align with the ANR video, since Eren seems to be the only one to make the transition to the orig universe and he seems to be mourning his friends back in universe 2 (as interpreted by OP)

I believe that the girl part is Mikasa and it is about her death. Here's my analysis:

*""I lost my way home. Evening upside down""*

-We all know Eren is Mikasa's ""family"", plus when they first met, Eren invited her back ""home""
- ""Evening upside down"" means she was not on Eren's side

*""With a chime that starts crying, Gradually falling down""*

-In reference with chapter 1, where eren woke up to Mikasa crying.
-""Chime"" is the sound of the leaves, and armin and zeke arc showed what it means to the friend trio.

*""You said you wouldn't let me finish my journey home, its okay to cry, just for now""*
-This  will be Eren killing Mikasa, and Mikasa telling him, its alright we're gonna see each othet again. Thus Mikasa's firshadowing in chapter 1, when eren heard ""see you later"".

*""What is happening along the railroad tracks? How will it bloom again next year?""*

-The railroad, was in reference to the scene where Eren and Mikasa was blushing in front of each other in chapter 108. This symbolizes their romantic feelings for each other, and if they would feel the same the ""next time"" they meet.
-Note that Mikasa is the ""flower"". The purple flower references in the anime, always appear in EreMika moments.

*""If the water is too hot, it will be too cold, If you're feeling drained, open the door to the night""*

-This is like Mikasa saying, if you miss me, you can visit me (through memories)
-""Open the door to the night"" symbolizes the ""paths""

*""You said you would not let me finish alone. Its okay to cry just for now""*

-This is like saying ""You promised to wrap that scarf around me (protect me) but you broke your promise.""

*""There's always tomorrow's lesson anyway,""*

-""You can always change it""

*""... I have to finish my homework and go to bed""*
- ""For now, I finished my duty (as a scout)... and die""

emmyeggo,yaujj36,"I think this theory changes how we look in AoT. The Eren from another universe morphogenetic travel to the AoT world with the start of the timeline, Chapter 1. He had the same personality and memories as AoT’s Eren and not much difference.

This all changed when he kiss Historia’s hand, it is not the royal blood rather by Ymir who sent all the memories Eren lost. This shocked Eren and he despaired over the situation. He knew he wanted to destroy humanity in his original universe. In a way, Eren did changed, he is not the AoT but rather the AoSC one. Like in AoSC, Eren regretted his dream so there are not much difference Eren in AoT world.

He pushed his friends away because I think he saw them as copy of his original universe friends. He did use lies back he meet Mikasa and Armin to justify his distance, maybe when he saw he hated Mikasa, because he saw her as a copy of the one from the original world. Of course he is also trying to train himself to be the villain, the one who destroy humanity on his original dream. We can see all over Marley and War of Paradis arc with him manipulating Zeke, torment his grandfather, goading his friends to attack and setting up the Yeagerists. Maybe Eren using the freedom ideology that his AoT counterpart have to justify his actions. 

Also I seen during the timeskip, Eren have prepare to be war with the world as seen in the shooting range. He is also seen cynical of the chance of peace, besides Eren wanted the world to be hostile at Paradis to give reason/excuse to destroy humanity. He also have a limited time gap to commit his action, that why he refused the 50 years plan not only to save Historia. He is not going through Marley conquest on Paradis despite different administration or Zeke's euthanization plan to go through as it seen to be time wasted spent in this world and clearly did not give a damn of consequences. Like in Eternal Champion, he wanted to slaughter his opponents as soon as possible and regret later, I think this is Eren's only way out of this cruel world that he wished. 

However, he still have emotions over his AoT friends and genuinely cared. I think Eren felt sorry for Ymir because he wished for the world in order to achieve his dream. In 131 where Kid Eren admiring the freedom, I think that is AoT Eren enjoying his dream, a somewhat kindness of the AoSC Eren to give AoT Eren the dream he wanted. Also in 853 in the train track, he did not want the Founding Titan to be passed on to his friends and don't want them to suffer the same fate as himself. After all knowing this world is created so Eren can destroy humanity can sent anyone to depression.

Also with Eren wishing the world, it made me switched perspective on Fritz I, he may be a cruel megalomaniac psychopath, but he is the devil that Eren asked for to create the world Eren desired. I haven't thought how Eren contact the devil but I ignored this for now. We know making deals with devils are unstable since the devil can name any price they want, so I am sure the devil wanted something harmful in exchange. Well I did thought of the parasite but this will derail the story we are talking about so I will skip. The devil disguise himself as Fritz I and uses Ymir to create the world Eren desired. When Ymir is in the Paths, he offer her a deal, freedom from the Paths in exchange on helping Eren to destroy humanity.",gmjtf5h,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-08 05:43:23,15,1,,emmyeggo,False

emmyeggo,Faulky1x,"Keep reading till the end you’ll understand it more, Also Something interesting I found that might give us hints to the characters who have potential to die in the finale is the friend groups. Yes you heard that right Isayama typically likes to have groups of friends consisting of 2 boys and 1 girl- examples are Eren Mikasa and Armin, Levi Erwin and Hange, Reiner Bertolt and Annie and then Jean Connie and Sasha now don’t get me wrong I completely understand all of these characters are friends aswell but you can’t deny the bond between 3 characters as 1 group is a lot more Prominent than the rest and I’ve noticed when 1 character dies or something bad happens the rest of the Group crumble aswell and it was right under our noses from the start when Eren first transformed into a Titan after being eaten we saw Armin and Mikasa become Suicidal in a sense and have no point in living demonstrated by Mikasa using all her gas knowing damn well she couldn’t make it but she was ok with dying because Eren did Armin also requested Mikasa leaves a blade with him so he could finish himself off. Or When Erwin died Levi and Hanges attitude completely changed Levi didn’t want to fight anymore and Hange died recently as we know. Same goes for Bertolt after he died Reiner was filled with instant regret and as he said just wanted to die peacefully. Same after Sasha died Connie and Jeans attitude changed Connie got to the point where he almost seemed like he wanted to die when he was dangling from Erens rib bone. Basically what I think Isayama is getting at is that these groups of 3 are important by this I mean once 1 person in the group dies the rest are guaranteed to follow them to their grave so based off this Judgement I’ve came to the conclusion of who I believe will survive and who will die in the finale 
Deaths - Connie Levi Jean Reiner Annie 
Survivors - Mikasa Armin Gabi Falco Eren 
This is based purely on the fact Isayama hasn’t touched the main group of 3 basically at all and when he does there is next to no chance they lose the fight yes I do believe the alternate universe ending theory is most likely but I feel that Isayama wants us to recognise the power of building strong relationships with others can have.",gnpn7yr,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-17 01:57:48,4,1,,emmyeggo,False

The sun part is shown if you go back to the last Episode of season 3 part 1 the night before the battle to retake wall maria. obviously its night time as it says in the title and we can see reiner and bertolt sitting on the wall facing north with the sun shining to their right side (east)

As for how we know they are looking north its because we see they are facing away from  Shiganshina and we know from the very first episode that titans attack from the south so them looking direct at the foot of the mountain can only mean they are looking north",gnkcka9,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-15 20:33:11,19,1,,emmyeggo,False

If Eren has seen only **fragmented future memories** of this event, where Tybur gives a speech and Renier begs, it's possible he wasn't expecting Tybur to say ""this world"" and was caught off guard by the phrasing.

“In numerology the 139 symbolizes the end of something and the beginning of something else. In other words, the “death” of one thing and the rebirth of another. The 139 symbolizes an important change, which can be in the right or wrong direction.”

It’s possible that “Attack on Titan” as a world dies/ends on chapter 139, since it’s fulfilled its purpose by being destroyed. Then something would be rebirthed as a result, ie: the Attack on School Castes world, or something else.

So then it’s possible we get more after 139 from a “rebirth”? Prob not, but it’s interesting to think about.",gm9qi1g,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-06 21:38:09,15,1,,emmyeggo,False

If I die, I won't even be able to remember you"". What does that mean? Why was she apologizing for continuing to fight? I find that really odd. Does it have something to do with these alternate universes and Mikasa's role in each of them?

Eren wished for the AOT story to happen while he lived in a parallel universe, he made a deal with Ymir though the deal would only be completed if he actually manages to ""Destroy humanity"" and become the enemy of the world he lives in. So if doesn't manage to get there the universe resets to it's start point which is ep1 and then you can basically insert the time loop theory (https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/lxy1q5/most_probable_ending_theory_youll_ever_read/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) which adds some interesting points and actually fits nearly perfect into this one I would only use your ending which is more fitting, I especially liked the parralel grisha - Eren whit the new life without memories.

On top of that, the final exchange between them in Volume 32 is 

Ymir appears before Eren.

Eren says “The one and only god Ymir has bestowed upon me her message!! Now all of humanity will be saved!!”

emmyeggo,InAsianSpaces,"Okay, I'm not going to lie when I started reading I was like ""yeah, right"" but by the end of it...it does make a lot of sense.

It would explain Eren saying that when he learned that humanity existed beyond the walls he was ""disappointed"". 

And it would explain the ""You started this story, didn't you"" right along with the ""Because I was born into **this** world"" line that Eren, Wily, Zeke, etc have said before. And the common theme.

And if that's true about Mikasa not having a memory wipe, it would explain her ""Ackerman genes"" activating - meaning her true power of knowing the truth of their world activating. That raises the stakes on her being unsure if Eren and herself will die forever if something happens, which is why she is so overprotective of him - she just wants to go home and return to their normal life.

(I wonder if this carries over to Levi as well. And to a certain extent, Kenny...since he wanted to be a serial killer in the capital.)

Man...this really would hurt a lot of Isayama's readers. I've never cared for Mikasa like that, but if she's the only one who knew the truth of **this** ""cruel, yet beautiful"" world...that'd be so fucked.

Over 10+ years living in a nightmare that Eren wished for, only for him to find out towards the end of his contract with Ymir...That still wouldn't explain what exactly Ymir is though. 

But if she was a slave in Eren's world...the Attack Titan's story...then maybe he saved her because she gave him the power in that world. He's the Earth Devil set to destroy it, and she was just an ordinary girl changed by unassuming circumstances in her character backstory...similar to Eren in the actual real world of HS Castes.

&#x200B;

Either way, very fascinating theory. I completely see the story differently now, and it's not a bad thing. All of the classroom stuff rferences and random Mikasa outbursts make perfect sense now. 

Or Mikasa's pained expression in that chapter when Eren goes to yell at Mikasa and Armin and then beats Armin up. When he throws a punch at Eren (or tries) Mikasa basically body slams him and then looks surprised and ashamed of herself. Maybe it was her reflex or ""Ackerman instincts"" (in that world) to protect him because she really wants to go home and he's her ticket out of there as well.

Like she wants to tell Armin the truth, but can't. And Eren won't listen to her.

Not to mention, I always thought the Tybur children's school uniforms were out of place. 

I recently re-watched Ep 22 of S3 to look at what flashbacks came true so far in season 4 and thought it was odd. Would make perfect sense if Eren was getting mixes of both the real world and his 'fantasy' Eldian life on Paradis....as the Earth Devil from Paradise who destroys the world.",gni5wi3,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-15 05:55:23,6,1,,emmyeggo,False

emmyeggo,Bradley_Solomon,">For example, you can play Muv Luv Alternative without actually playing Muv Luv Extra (which shows the ‘past’ universe).

UH. No Muv-Luv Alternative is the third part of a trilogy and Muv-Luv Extra plays an important role in establishing the characters and themes. and the events of Extra directly tie into the plot of Alternative. Alternative calls back to very specific events from Extra that become important later on, so obviously you're supposed to read Extra. so no, you can't simply just read Alternative without reading Extra (and by extension Unlimited). all the worldbuilding and set-up and foreshadowing throughout Extra and Unlimited is 100% necessary to the story of Alternative. *that's how trilogies work.*

additionally, Muv-Luv was originally planned out and written as one overarching story. Alternative is not seperate from Extra and Unlimited. all three titles form one complete narrative.

So I fear this ending would feel extremely cheap to them (and some manga readers too) unless of course chapter 138 or 139 are super long and detailed and put all the loose ends to rest. Which I honestly believe Isayama can pull off. However if Isayama does not pull off this ending perfectly this would receive mass backlash and I would be very disappointed. So to wrap it up I hope Isayama continues to do Isayama things and doesn't screw this up!

emmyeggo,whatisgoingonpeople,"Hey, I left a comment yesterday about how some things did not add up to this theory. Today, I reread chapter 137, and I concluded that there is an ALTERNATIVE WORLD in AOT. However, it is not the world you are talking about. The alternative world is nothing other than THE PATHS. At the beginning of chapter 137, Zeke mentions how Ymir Fritz gave birth to something stronger, larger, to an undying body. Then he added “She escaped to a WORLD that was free... of even death.” Armin then asks “Isn’t there some way of getting back to the outside WORLD from here?” The time when Eren tells Ymir that he will put an end to THIS WORLD, he did not mean any world other than THE PATHS it self. He wants to put an end to the WORLD of suffering that Ymir lived in for the past 2,000 years...

emmyeggo,whatisgoingonpeople,"I really enjoyed reading about this theory, however I would be disappointed if it happened. I am unsure if someone will end up reading my comment here, but I found few things that did not add up to this theory. Here they come:

1) As we all know, Armin is the narrator of the story. If he were to go back to the AU, he would forget all about what happened. So, how come he still remembers the events of the Attack on Titan world?? I know some may argue that he will sacrifice himself and stay in the AOT world, but that does not make sense... Armin was always a character that looks for peace. He wants to be able to live in peace and harmony with people from all around the world. This theory would COMPLETELY RUIN all the hardship Armin went through to achieve piece. YES, HE WENT THROUGH HARDSHIP, it is really hard to keep that peaceful mentality in a world filled with hatred and suffering.

2) As I understood from the theory, the part with kids in Uniform is supposedly to be in the AU. Well, I do not think this is the case. If you actually pay attention to colours used in that scene, you will be able to see a yellowish flash, which is the same flash that appears during the transformation to a titan. I have a theory for this scene, maybe the world ends up living in piece with the Eldians. The part where the flash appears, a girl had a really shocked expression on her face (because she saw a human transforming into a titan??). Also on their Uniform, there is a fallen bird symbol, which appeared in S4 opening (My War). I think this is a symbolism to honour the ""fallen"" or people who have sacrificed themselves in order to achieve the peace the world is in right now. 

That is all of what came up to my mind reading this theory for now...

emmyeggo,ijustwannadielol,"This is very convincing, I’ll give you that. However, to me there’s some parts of your theory that you’re taking out of context to fit your theory.

For example, when Armin talks about wanting to still believe that there is still a world out there that they don’t know about, he’s talking about the paths realm and the people still living in it. Same with the chapter 122, it is just hinting at the paths universe with the parasite.

Eren saying “I’m putting an end to this world” means ending paths and thus the Titan curse and pure titans.

Mikasa telling Armin that he’s saved them before is referring to Armin telling Hannes about Mikasa and Eren needing rescue when Carla was crushed.

i did suspect before that multiple universes could be at work.  my previous theory was that Eren would eat all nine titans (Armin included last), become the living embodiment of Ymir Fritz the founder, then send memories back thousands of years to the original Ymir before she made the deal with the devil, showing her the millennia of the cursed history of the eldian race and convincing her not to take the deal.  then he wakes up with everyone around him he knows in a world where titans never existed, and ""eldians"" are just humans.  im sure you could comb the chapters for supporting evidence if you tried

emmyeggo,YaBoiDanish,"I really like how much evidence there is for this theory, though there are a few parts of this theory that kinda bother me:
1 In chapter 131, we can clearly see Eren temporarily being conflicted about if genociding the world really should be done. He even says that killing only the people inside the walls would result in less deaths than if he went full rumbling, but he quickly refutes that idea saying that he can't accept that. This to me seems like he does the rumbling for the sake of Paradis, not to fulfill his supposed 'mission' that'd take him back to the schoolverse. Also, what counts as destroying humanity? Only the people outside the walls? Shouldn't the walldians also count as humanity, thus needing to be destroyed?
2 Supposedly, Eren made the deal with Ymir in the schoolverse, but when? Eren does wish for a more entertaining world, but he never directly said it to Ymir. The only two times he met Ymir was seeing her while talking to Falco and Gabi and the other time was when Ymir told her how to save humanity(I might me misremembering this), which was cleaning yourself. There's no way Eren made the deal in any of these interactions. Also, he wished for it at first, but after getting an experience of something that is not as boring as his normal life(kidnapping), he clearly regrets it and even wishes he never thought about it. If Eren made the deal sometime after those 2 encounters with Ymir, it wouldn't make a licker of sense tbh.
Anyways, that's all I have to say. This theory is really wel made and I can clearly see how much effort went into this. Though, if I'm gonna be honest, I wouldn't like this ending, mainly because every person in SnK that isn't Eren had motivations and goals that in the end, amounted to nothing, as they were just born into a world purely meant for Eren to destroy it. I think this ending focuses too much on Eren alone. I'd like an ending that focuses on all the (surviving) main cast with all their arcs completed. You said something that with this theory, you can also add your other theory and it'd would perfectly fit, but imo, adding this theory on top of the actual end of the SnK world that we know of would strip of a lot of meaning and would make the world feel very empty.

Appreciate you responding to my questions. Very interesting and you’ve just fuelled my desire and desperation to learn the ending even more. This is so torturing!! I really enjoyed and can’t help but be impressed with you validating your points in this hypothesis. 

I don’t deny that the possibility of EH baby is there. It’ll be a little lame if it turns out to be just nothing but red herring. But...but...I still don’t want that though, cos at least from what’s revealed so far, it’ll be an out-of-character decision for Eren the way I see it. He didn’t want to recognise Mikasa’s feelings because he only had 4 years left, yet he could father a child with Historia? Moreover, like I said, I’m still not convinced that there are circumstances for the duo to have a kid to happen. I guess we’ll know more after C137. 

I’m not familiar with Muv Luv, but are you saying that the ending of that anime/manga further cements a possible ending for EH in the AoT universe? Ok but ☹️

I’ve actually tried to find some traces of possible endings by watching AoT live action movies. Because Isayama said that despite it being a standalone story, the movie will have elements from the original manga. It may not be anything but the movie did end with Eren and Mikasa looking on to the world that they had discovered after scaling the wall. 🤷🏻‍♀️",gm878m4,ldfsg3,titanfolk,2021-02-06 14:05:05,2,3,gm82rp5,emmyeggo,False

Let’s just go by your theory, I have a few of questions though; 

1) So did Eren and friends travelled to the alternate universe with him or is it just him? 

2) Why and how did he travel? He just made it happen because he wished for something to happen? 

3) Why must Eren fathered Historia’s baby? He definitely doesn’t like/love her, so I concluded if he is the father, there has to be a reason for that choice. What is that reason if what you’re hypothesising is correct?

I’d be thrilled if you can clear my doubts. 😁

I wouldn't mind it? it makes everything a bit simpler but I guess that would be the actual point, to escape all the complicated shit in the SnK AU for a simpler life... 

I do find it interesting how Eren would then be some sort Haruhi Suzumiya type of god/center of the universe type being. Absolute control and completely unaware of i. Except instead of a god in the traditional, malevolent, sense he's more of a god of destruction? Not only that but it'd kinda make since with his devil schema thing going on... In this theory,  as soon as he's born, the universe is doomed to end because of him being unsatisfied. So in a since he'd sort of be a tragic *anti-christ*. 

Forever trapped in a cycle of being unfulfilled with how his life is and wishing for the opposite (wishing for action in castes, then for peace in SnK), unable to see that while his grass might not be green, the grass on the other side isnt either. As well as dooming everyone around him to suffer with whatever path he takes (leaving behind a quiet, simple life in castes -> having to suffer in SnK, working hard to make that universe better, only to have that hard work amount to nothing when a universe will be started anyways -> rinse, repeat).

emmyeggo,ATOMate,"So after reading all this I wanna give my thought. Firstly I wanna commend you for doing this.  

The panel with the shard memories is indeed interesting. Even with his comment of wanting to link the school universe to the current one, I could still very much see this being just an easter egg-manga panel could still just be an easter egg.

You touch on the fact that Eren and Mikasa specifically talk about ""this world"" and not just ""the world"". I honestly do not see much of anything in there. Saying ""this world"" is reasonable and in the context of sounding dramatic it is a perfectly viable choice of words.

The fact that Eren can alter memories of past Attack Titan users does not imply the existence of alternate universes in my opinion. I see AoT as the type of story, where every alteration of the past has already happened and was always destined to happen. This allows the story to still be within one singular timeline and have no branches. A story that can branch off often feels pointless because one timeline will always be saved and another is probably doomed.  Multiple timelines of the same universe significantly lower the impact of everything that happens in one timeline. From a story telling perspective it is a huge risk to go down that route. So I really do believe that AoT does not jump timelines when Eren alters the past.

Another point I wanna touch upon is Historias baby. If we do in fact jump to an alternate reality in the end, I do not see that Historias baby story line going anywhere. It'd be a lose end to me. You mentioned the parallel to Grisha, of Eren getting a second chance in said alternate reality with Mikasa. But I just don't see tat working out, the mini cliffhanger of Historias baby would be abandoned and not feel satisfying to me. Maybe some extra scenes with her could fix this minor issue I have, but I do not quite see that happening.

The image of Ymir and the Devil looks quite significant. But is it really? I tried to find the scene of the anime where it was shown, but I couldn't find it. I remember this scene being used to explain the origins of the titan and Ymir. (Somewhere around the end of season 3 I think) Again, this based on my memory alone. Was this not used as the explanation to how Ymir got her original titan powers? ""A deal with the devil"" This was mere specualtion. No one except Ymir, and now probably Eren, knew how Ymir got her powers. So it was just assumed that it must have been a deal with a devil. This picture does not necessarily reflect reality. Gotta check that scene again, to confirm this though

&#x200B;

What I do find very interesting are the opening and ending lyrics. My god, they are just way too specific to not mean anything. We did have the entire Ymir story in the Season 2 ending after all. These things aren't just songs with funny pictures. So I do believe Isayama defintely wants the school universe to be part of his story line. 

Now having said that, I do think that it is possible that the school universe will not be part of the main manga story line. It could be type of thing we speculate about for years to come. Leaving some things to be interpreted and analysed sounds like the Isayama thing to do to me.

How would this theory connect to eren’s encounter with ymir in paths?

It freed her and showed her true human interaction for the first time.

If she’s the one that created the world under Eren’s wish, why would there be this connection? If it was pure suffering, would she not resent eren for the deal, and how does it connect to sending eren a message 2k years later for him to free her?

If the shard of memory (castes AU) that Eren sees is so important for the development of the ending then i have a couple of questions...

2. Why didn't he introduce the AU within the main story and not at the end of every volume?

3. why we haven't seen anything related to the AU in the anime.

4. If the fragment of AU (armin and mikasa) is important then shouldn't it be bigger and more centrally located on the page instead of being tiny and in a corner?

5. Explain to us the existence of Ymir as a God in the AU and why it seems that Eren is the only one who can see her?

6. In the AU why would Ymir make Eren wish of destroying the world  come true in the first place? What does she gain from doing so?

I'm totally soured on Isayama's ability to write an ending without feeling the pressure of expectations and whatnot, and this theory also continues to completely ignore Historia as she has no relevancy in most anything you mention, but I'd be somewhat accepting of this.

That said, you reference The Eternal Champion here, but the parallels between SnK and that series mostly centered around one Champion, Ereköse. With the 139 ending, Ereköse and Eren are no longer really similar, but before that there were many similarities between the two characters and their actions, specifically how they each chose to carry out omnicide in order to save a minority people using secret weapons the opponents had no hope of countering(in Ereköse's case his final decision was based on selfish love, for Eren if you didn't believe in EreHisu it was simply for his people. I *much* prefer the selfish decision of Ereköse and find it to make him one of the more compelling champions, even up there with Elric and Corum).

emmyeggo,StNerevar76,"I'm saying this isn't the real ending since the beginning, giving reasons for it, and getting mostly ""can't hear you"". Which is the same I got for more than a year when explaining why the rumbling was actually about getting Ymir to end the curse. 

The ending does not make sense because Ymir couldn't love, so no way she loved Fritz. Because Eren would not have rolled with his visions, and already had conflicting memories of Grisha with Frieda. Because there was no time, and no colossals, to rumble outside Marley, let alone 80% of the world. Because when they jumped off the plane, they don't want to kill him, but after stopping the colossals they go for the kill. Because Mikasa would have been killed within days of arriving at Paradis, let alone how she got there, let alone peacefully forming a family there. Because a peace embassy won't include traitors and mass murderers (Reiner and Annie),...

Does not make sense. But people believe it's real. Will defend it's real, while hating it. And that should give anybody pause. 

It's not a prank, but a lesson. 

About possible sequels...transmitting titanization means someone would have to become the origin of the paths. Trapped there again. And this ending goes for all cliché moves and nihilistic hacks that writers with not enough talent use to ruin stories thinking they are elevating themselves. Isayama showed repeatedly that he's above them. As AU Armin says, it goes for the easy and obvious.

Remember the final panel Isayama leaked? The one in 139 is neither the panel, nor the baby, nor makes any sense Grisha would say that. He didn't change it, he showed it as a clue.

About other works in this world... I really would like the story about Karl Fritz. No way the set up in the present was a fluke, he was going for it. He wasn't too stupid to believe, we should not have believed he was so stupid. Same for Willy.",h7kguiz,ox6105,titanfolk,2021-08-03 18:24:34,-3,3,h7ke865,emmyeggo,False
emmyeggo,StNerevar76,"No, for a very simple reason.

You can have things ending badly and still making sense.

This ending doesn't, and is very deliberate in how it goes at it. Characters, themes, look 180° from where they should.

It's not things ended this bad, it's that there's no way they could have ended this way.

The timeline isn't fixed. Ch 63. Now about everybody that reads what I post is trying to headcanon it as art evolution, or Isayama not checking back when he drew ch 121. If I, or anybody, had realized it back then, we would have caught the trap the moment it was sprung on us, because Isayama had given us enough information to be able to do so.

But I don't think it's pararel universes, but kind of reloading an earlier save and trying something else with the accumulated knowledge of how things failed. Same plane of existance.

What I see in general is that despite realizing perfectly the ending is 100% wrong, hardly anybody can deny it, because it's the ending to the narrative since ch 121, and people got too captivated by Eren's, and the story's, nihilism. If they deny the ending, they deny the story.

Isayama is very much antinihilistic. That should have said it all.

If Gabi acknowledged Kaya's arguments against the marleyan propaganda at the barn, she denied the propaganda. 

Notice the similarity? This is a lesson, not a simple stunt.

Something that will subvert expectations but in a good way, AU Armin says, while his conversation with Mikasa points out how weak this ending is. My guess is that's for some time after the anime ends. No point changing anime, because if this targeted only manga readers, it'd wait too long for it. Vol 34 would have been a much better moment. The shitstorm will break again with the anime onlies reaction, P1 left clear they were taking the bait.",h7kd00p,ox6105,titanfolk,2021-08-03 17:57:43,-2,1,,emmyeggo,False

Also, assuming there will be a 12-13 episode Final Season Part 2, then ending at 116 would nicely parallel the end of the first part of Season 3: the SC riding to Shiganshina to do battle with Reiner/Bertolt vs Reiner and co. flying into Shiganshina to take on Eren.",go0qeuw,lniq1p,titanfolk,2021-02-19 17:23:36,33,1,,uchihacoltro,False

Read to the end to understand

Mikasa is a killing machine, the closest thing to the Terminator.

yes, she used non-lethal moves at the beginning, but you don't have to be an idiot ( I mean the characters ) to know that it would be short lived

I think killing the guys with the thunderspears and bathing in their blood was unnecessary ( in the context of the AOT world, because for the viewer it was AMAZINGLY GREAT ).

But I digressed a bit

The harbor battle was not Mikasa's fault, nor Connie's, nor the yeagerists, shit even Floch is innocent.

The great fault, of the great slaughter to humanity, are Eren and Historia.

Floch was used as a puppet by Eren to fulfill his part of the plan to provoke Mikasa.

Historia, she is an idiot, she was too cowardly to turn against Eren and let herself be coerced into having a child, she preferred to save herself than the world...which clearly sets her apart from Mikasa

Mikasa, Connie ,Samuel, Daz, that poor girl who almost killed Mikasa ( and Jean saved her again BTW ) were just soldiers in different positions, used as cannon fodder for Eren's mega plan and Historia's cowardly silence",i1vmnml,tlsodc,AttackOnRetards,2022-03-24 02:50:52,40,1,,Mysterious-Tutor-942,False

It's also hard to me to take seriously the complaints that are coming from fans that were pretty much already hating on Mikasa before she did any of this, or even hating Connie for shooting Samuel and Daz, sounds to me like they ignore the point.

ClarityInMadness,br1nsk,"Yeah but ultimately these are mostly all nitpicks and not major issue, they are far less divisive. 

1- Plot armour is extremely common in anime and manga these days, and frankly the main cast of AoT has always had some. It does get stretched quite far in the finale which has always personally annoyed me but it also isn’t outside the bounds of reason for these characters. 

2- Never understood this subs issue with the necrokiss. Not only is it an incredibly common trend in media for characters to kiss their dead loved ones, it’s also quite common in real life. Certainly isn’t the disgusting thing people make it out to be. 

3- The source of all living matter is an actual glaring issue that definitely takes away from the ending, but ultimately it wasn’t essential to the narrative. It being kind of ignored at the end is mainly just dissatisfying. 

4- Again, nitpick. I don’t love this moment either but it lasts about 5 seconds. It’s a joke at the expense of Reiner’s character, but a joke nonetheless and isn’t meant to be taken that seriously. 

5- I did not like this either, one of my biggest problems with the ending is that besides Hange the alliance took no major casualties, and the final battle against tens of the strongest titans in history actually went absurdly well for them. Transforming everyone to Titans was done for shock value, but it is instantly diminished by them all turning back straight away. Imo either Connie or Jean should have died. Or both. 

6- Minor issue. Obviously not great Isayama didn’t explain this, but also people have an incredibly bad  faith interpretation of it here. She obviously didn’t swim across, she waited with the alliance and went back with them. She walks off at the end because she probably wants a moment alone. I also doubt Eren’s decapitated head is rotting with her the whole time, it was probably turned into a skull or something. 

Anyway my point is that those are all not huge issues that ruin the ending. If you were happy with how Eren’s character resolved, but all of this still happened, I promise you wouldn’t still be here 2 years later complaining about the ending.",k81lhov,17obtdy,titanfolk,2023-11-06 08:55:52,2,3,k7zpr83,ClarityInMadness,False
ClarityInMadness,br1nsk,"What’s become abundantly clear to me, and what should have been clear a while ago, is that the way you perceive the ending is completely dependent on how you perceive Eren. 

Most people on this sub don’t buy the idea that he had no idea what he was doing the whole time, and that the way he acts in the end is a mischaracterisation of him. I think this is a fair critique. 

However, if you simply take the story at face value, the way he’s characterised is a lot easier to stomach. Whilst the ending has other issues, whether you’ll enjoy it or not is solely based on how you feel about how Eren is handled. Everything else that happens in the ending isn’t too bad, and imo is pretty decent. If you viewed Eren as someone who never changed before this, then the ending makes sense. The problem is that a lot of people were under the impression he DID change, and that makes the choices with his character confusing and frustrating. 

Additionally, the final episode is a lot better than the final chapter. If you ignore story and just judge it on production value, it’s a great episode. Great animation, great voice acting, and great music. They even got Linked Horizon back. It’s a very enjoyable episode for those reasons alone. Plus the minor story and dialogue changes were good. 

Ultimately the reaction isn’t very surprising. Titanfolk has always been a bit of an echo chamber, as most subreddits are, so it’s easy to forget that a lot of people do not share the issues we have with the ending. I think in time people will be a bit more harsh on the conclusion, as people spend more time analysing the story as a whole.

ClarityInMadness,Deserteagle7,"To be fair, these are all nitpicks beyond the plot armor one, but even that isn't objectively bad, just annoying. The kiss really isn't a big deal, there are tons of scenes of people kissing their lovers as they die in media, the Hallucegenia is annoying to me too but its not like I expect Isayama to go into detail about the origins of it as that's kind of the point of soft magic systems(which it essentially is), Reiner sniffing the letter while weird is not a big deal, the fake out deaths is stupid but again is not bad enough to treat as a dealbreaker for the ending, and the Mikasa travel thing could be explain in some ways like there being some surviving boats or something. There are some legitimate criticisms with the ending and some fairly big ones too, but like the other guy said none are really too big to overlook(though they hamper enjoyment to degrees and make it worse) if you are okay with the core of the ending which is Eren, which will vary for people.",k814kcs,17obtdy,titanfolk,2023-11-06 05:38:29,2,3,k7zpr83,ClarityInMadness,False

This is literally the most logical conclusion as to what happened, and I'm nearly certain exactly what you said is what happened. I know you didn't say anything against this, but my problem with the ending isn't Eren not showing grisha a baby Ymir or something, that honestly doesn't seem as impactful to me, but my problem is Eren ending before 100%. I think the best story along the lines of AnR would be grisha's motivation would be exactly what you said, it just makes the most sense, and then the fact that Eren killed his mom to get Grisha to give him to titan, so that Eren could rumble the entire world to be free of the cycle of hatred constantly terrorizing him and threatening to take his freedom away. That stays consistent with the idea that Eren values freedom above all else. Above his friends. Above the world. Above his father. Above his mother. In light of all else, FREEDOM is the sole thing Eren will always prioritize, and what I wish would have happened would be Eren destroying LITERALLY EVERYTHING (the world, his father who loved him, his mother who loved him, his brother who loved him, his friends that love him) EVERYTHING so that he can have that freedom. That would be the perfect ending that I feel is retconned by Eren for some reason doing this so that his friends can look good or whatever. That was never a motivation of his before, he just wanted himself and his home to be free. Anyways, I totally agree with you OP, this makes the most sense for the Grisha question, and I'm not sure why you're getting the hate.

pixel_139,Independent-Couple87,"Considering he likes Watchmen, it is possible he took inspiration from there for the ending. 

Like Eren, Ozymandias brought World Peace with mass murder. The heroes tried to stop him, but all except for Rorschach agree to help him keep the secret for the greater good. Rorschach is killed to prevent him from telling the public (though it is implied he might have already by sending his diary to a newspaper). 

Doctor Manhattan later points out that ""Nothing ever ends"", that the peace Ozymandias built will not last forever (even if Rorschach was unsuccessful at leaking the plot). The name Ozymandias comes from a poem about the Pharaoh Ramesses II, whom ruled a powerful kingdom in Egypt that ultimately fell with the passage of time. 

Similarly, I think the ending of Attack on Titan was meant to have a similar meaning. That the word peace, regardless of if ti came by Diplomacy or Genocide,  will be temporary. War WILL return to Paradis. 

If the problem was the romance between Eren and Mikasa, that could have another explanation. Isayama once said on an interview that he disliked the Childhood Friend Romance trope.

And as for whether I agree with the content in this post or not: I most definitely have had the same concerns you’ve made apparent, so it was nice to be validated with a really well-worded post.

 I would like to ask you one thing though: do you think this “filler” might not be filler at all? For example, we know that there’s going to be some extra foreshadowing for Ymir’s “relationship” with King Fritz according to Paolo. And for a while, I’ve thought about how necessary it would be for the anime to smooth over the ending’s flaws with not “filler” but **completely new and original foreshadowing.** Do you think the reason for the slow (1x) pacing, even within action-based episodes, is only because there will be entirely original buildup for the ending?",hqw5t45,rtiq0w,titanfolk,2022-01-02 04:52:05,2,1,,berthototototo,False
berthototototo,JadeDotWu,"The filler and switches from the manga are intended to fix the issues. I don't think it's going to actually change the ending.


In my head the first episode will cover Mikasa's flashback after the Rumbling. It gets moved to the front to do a couple of things: reinforce the fact that Mikasa is important, remind the audience what's happening, and build to the battle. From there everything is played MOSTLY straight with a more additions- like Falco dream sequences when he becomes a Titan, and Zeke's Titanization Scream getting more of a focus.


The remaining 'filler' will be used to address plot-holes further down the line. There's gonna be more bullshit with the Alliance, like Annie and Levi talking. It's possible the Connie thing gets deleted or reworked altogether. If it stays in then we'll probably get extra short story sequences of other characters... like Historia. I think Connie also won't nab Falco until the Titan threat is MOSTLY finished. He's such an ass in the manga. The Titans are devouring people around him and he fuckin' BOOKS it with Falco. It's super out of character.


But mark my words I THINK there will be an entire Mikasa filler episode. Gods help us. It'll probably have something to do with ""I can sense where Eren is- like he's calling to me"", and some more explanation about the Azumabito, like tying that symbol Mikasa has to something about sacrifice or some bullshit Ymir/Fritz allegory.",hqvddol,rtiq0w,titanfolk,2022-01-02 01:18:21,1,1,,berthototototo,False

bigmemes4,TeamBulletTrain,"My favorite thing about AoT was the Norse references. The rumbling being Ragnarok and Eren being like Baldr is kinda bad ass.

EDIT: now that I’m thinking about it, wouldn’t Eren be more like Loki? Loki is the one who starts Ragnarok with an army of giants, he does become a bird multiple times. I could be talking out of my ass but I’d love to hear thoughts. 

I can also see multiple references to Odin from Eren. Ymir was Odins father just like our Ymir is The Founder. There’s a lot of references to spears , Eren loses his eye briefly and gains ultimate knowledge. Plus the big ass tree. Odin sacrifices himself to himself at the world tree, so maybe Eren reborn is waiting in the tree.

OP is nihilistic and all, but I mean that was sort of expected considering the source material. Take a look at the fanbase, most of them liked the ending, but they also liked the hardcore OP. I think it’s just because in their minds, the ending won’t be changed just because the Rumbling is portrayed as very metal, because the “ReVeAl” of Eren faking the whole thing would still happen.

TheCartTitan,favoredfire,"Well I'm personally bummed. I think separating 130 and 131 is a bad call. The two chapters play off each other so well and breaking Eren's flashbacks up feels not just jarring but gives a different feel to the audience, like 130 is far better understood in the context of 131 or idk if I'm explaining it well. 

Probably just my own bias to group those two together, because I can see MAPPA thinking ending part 2 with a hint of Eren's POV (130) and starting a movie/next part with it as well (131) is almost bookends, especially with the end (139 ) giving his POV again. It also ensures we get some Eren POV in both parts (or part 2 and the movie) rather than just to close off part 2 and then get nothing direct until the very end of whatever comes next.

I also really hope they don't do a movie now, fitting in 131-139 into one movie feels like too much imo.",hzef97o,t6w5qe,AttackOnRetards,2022-03-05 03:15:21,6,1,,TheCartTitan,False

EMJG30,Norim01,"Chapter 121 didn’t do it for me tbh.

I honestly think it was meant to be a red herring in the original ending; Eren made Zeke believe that he manipulated Grisha into killing the Reiss family, tricking Zeke (and Ymir Fritz) to think that everything was predestined. ''Eren set the story in motion'' isn’t such a good plot-twist anyway; It’s incredibly appealing, but a predetermined, causal time-loop (''You cannot change fate'') doesn’t make sense in regards to the story’s anti-nihilistic thematic backdrop.

If you compare the Cavern scene as it was depicted in 63 (https://imgur.com/a/0yKV2L1) with the one from 121 (https://imgur.com/a/DxM6maE), they’re different from one another in terms of Frieda’s behaviour as well as Grisha’s as well as the Reiss family’s. Also, Frieda notices Eren’s presence in Chapter 121: https://i.imgur.com/nnTMWBa.jpg

Furthermore, the scene from Chapter 1 is different from how it was depicted in Chapter 121, Grisha’s facial expressions went from neutral (https://i.imgur.com/C0IFixj.jpg ) to frightened (https://i.imgur.com/0GiWohq.jpg) and that shouldn’t happen if the story is predestined.

However with the way Isayama has portrayed the two, for me, I really hope there’s a really reasonable reason why Historia’s kid inherited the Beast Titan. If Eren and Historia were really planning for her or THEIR child to inherit a Titan power, they are no better than Rod, Karina, Mr. Leonhart. They would essentially be using her kid for a tool and one of the main things Isayama has been trying to drill into us is to not let children be used for any sort of plan. Eren and Historia would be by far the WORST characters to do that, Eren for all the times he’s protected Historia’s from becoming a Titan and his constant rejection of her using her own kid, Historia for obvious reasons. Isayama would butcher their characters more than he already has this final arc.

Conqueringrule,NationalSea9072,"Ending defender here. I disagree with most of these and I would like to explain why. Hear me out at least, because I don't want my time spent writing this to be wasted.
First, Mikasa returning with Eren's head is, I agree, somewhat of an issue. It's not necessarily impossible, as Fort Salta is relatively close to the African coast. Any boats there should be available, and Mikasa would have the ability to commandeer one. I do think Isayama didn't fully consider how it would be possible though.
Second, Saying that the final battle has absurd plot armor is completely missing the point of it. Eren only went through with the rumbling because he thought it would be what's best to protect his friends. He does care for the island of Paradis, but they are an afterthought compared to his core friend group. As he states on the train scene, he cares for them more than anyone in the world. He even refuses to allow any of them to inherit his titan, even if it would be best for someone familiar with Eren to inherit it. 
Of course, he does make sacrifices to get further. Hange dies, which he expresses guilt for, but he is never as close to her as the rest.
If he killed any of his close friends in the rumbling, what would be the point of it? He would be alone in the trampled world. If you wanted a mist-type ending, that's a matter of personal opinion. It was not Isayama's intention and wouldn't have worked in the story as it was written.
Onto the main points:
1. We don't know if it is Jean. That's on purpose, it's supposed to be up to interpretation.
2. Falco is unique. As far as we know, no other pure made by Zeke's spinal fluid has eaten a shifter. Annie has consumed some part of each shifter (perhaps their spinal fluid), but that's different than an initial transformation entirely from the beast. It is convenient for the plot, but I see no reason to think it's completely impossible. Marley was still actively researching titan shifting because of how much they didn't know. Applying arbitrary rules based on what little the reader has seen is not a reason to assume a plot hole. 
Falco probably flies about 2300 miles based on the location of the Azumabito base and Fort Salta. While that's a large distance for a normal titan, birds can travel much further than any other animal. Some can travel 7,000 miles without stopping. Considering that he was flying along the trade winds, it's completely possible.
He's not particularly powerful in any way, either. He would be terrible at attacking other Titans because they could grab and pin him to the ground. His wings would be atrocious in physical combat. He is used as, and is good as, a moving base. He does not outpace Zeke in combat in any way.
At the very least, Falco's titan wasn't a last-minute addition. It is probably the most foreshadowed titan in the series. 
3. Assigning limits to time travel is stupid because time travel destroys a timeline no matter what. Everything in the AOT universe is a bootstrap paradox, and the Dina twist doesn't change that. Also, her promise never made sense. For being so focused on how everything in the ending should logically happen, it doesn't make sense to care about Dina's promise. Even if she does have a special connection to Grisha to seek him out, Eren isn't Grisha. We see no evidence that Eldians genetically share space in paths - which would have to be the case for Dina to find Eren when seeking Grisha. Dina finding Eren consistently is a ""convenience"" for the plot, but it creates an extraordinarily poignant situation during Scream and Carla's death, which helps create the most important moments of the story. It's not like coincidences don't happen in real-life either.
4. Ymir's connection with Mikasa is completely logical. Her impossible romance to Eren mirrors Ymir's impossible romance with Fritz. Whether or not you like Ymir's secret love, her connection with Mikasa is objectively real. Eren's death at the hands of Mikasa is what defines the ending, and that's also what defines Ymir's reason for moving on. It's not like it makes Eren unimportant, because he's still half of the romantic situation. His entire life was leading to that moment, too, even if he wasn't the one to take the final action. This has also been a theme of the story, hammered upon in Bystander.
5. Ackermann memory manipulation is (as far as we know) due to a deal between the royal family and the Ackermann house. While the Royal family is prohibited from manipulating their memories, we don't have evidence to suggest the same limit applies to Ymir - it seems more likely that she is all powerful over her subjects.
The Azumabito/Mikasa plotline is not pointless. It provides the Azumabito with another motivation to come to Paradis. It isn't capitalized on because of the rumbling, but it does matter.
6. We have no reason to think that Frieda would be good in combat. She was young, and she probably never trained. She did use harmless memory manipulation, but that's completely different than fighting. Did you forget about the vow renouncing war?
I don't think there really is major plot armor in the port battle. The main cast are by far the best and most experienced warriors on the planet fighting mostly recruits. On top of that, nearly half of them are shifters.
7. This one is definitely a problem. While it's possible Isayama had reasoning, I think it's just as likely that it was an oversight. That said, it doesn't really matter. The rumbling stopping doesn't have much impact on the rest of the fight.
8. Saying without doubt that Kruger would support the rumbling is illogical. We know barely anything about Kruger or his background. What we do know is scattered. He is a hardcore patriot, but he's also human. There's little reason to think he would want to commit genocide against all nations (because Marely is a small piece of the global rumbling).
10. This whole post about Armin is terrible for numerous reasons. Armin retains his intelligence. He is largely responsible for the enormously successful raid on Liberio. His plan to nuke the founding titan is also decent considering how much they didn't know. What else could he have come up with given their situation?
11. There is no reason to think that Wall titans are just giant pure titans. That's completely illogical. If they were, it would've started moving immediately to attack Mikasa when it saw her. Obviously, they're completely subservient titans who will only move when commanded. Coving them from sunlight would make sense from Nick's perspective too. Nick doesn't know everything about the titans, but he would likely know that they need sunlight. It is logical for him to be worried about the sun waking them up, even if it realistically wouldn't. Covering them also stops the titans from being seen, which Nick wants anyway.
13. There was no Historia character assassination - she just settled down. That's normal human behavior.
14. Assuming that the wall titan reveal invalidates the entire alliance plan makes no sense. The plan was fine and there was literally no other option for them.
15. The founding titan has absolute power. That effectively invalidates all specific other abilities, but it doesn't make the Warhammer useless. The Warhammer's ability is the only reason Eren can break out of prison without being crushed. It is needed for the ending to happen.
16. Eren and Mikasa's relationship (or lack thereof) is one of Isayama's admitted regrets. He regrets them not kissing at Scream and having a more obvious relationship. I agree as well that it should've been shown better. That's not to say it was a retcon though, as we know it was planned since then. It is definitely foreshadowed in Marley, when he asks her ""what am I to you"", and it is foreshadowed when he asks Zeke about it, and they have a conversation about their relationship.
Comparing it to Casca and Griffith is also pointless because they are different series. Isayama compares Mikasa's direct attributes to Casca, not her relationships.

Conqueringrule,Ok_Celebration9304,"My eyes hurt from focusing too hard so I only read up to the point of Reiner and Eren's parallels. You bring up lots of good points,  though. I personally was sort of put off by the Reiner and Eren rivalry and how s4 turned to be Eren doing what Reiner did to him for revenge. It's not a bad idea but I feel like there are better contenders to act as the ""villains"" and enemies of Eren after the reveal about the outside world. The people who are in higher positions and more in control, who controlled and sent Reiner there in the first place. Like the Tyburs who could've been expanded on more. But I understand the logic of why it was written this way to flip the narrative on Reiner and stuff. It's just feels weird and wrong that the enemy was Reiner all along or something and Eren wants to take his revenge starting with him. Something's missing but I can't put my finger on it.


Also, I really agree about the church in s2. They hyped me up to the reveals about the walls and secrets of the titans, then faded into irrelevancy. They could've played a big role in s4 with their knowledge about the rumbling and the wall titans, maybe even helped the alliance or something and gave them clues on how to stop or prevent it all together or something. Wasted potential. And when Zeke was killed the titans just stood there instead of acting up due to sunlight like the pastors said they would. So much world building and foreshadowing thrown out the window. ",m8fs8f8,1i6uodn,titanfolk,2025-01-22 00:07:50,15,1,,Conqueringrule,False

Beginning of volume 13 (cut from the anime) Armin notes that even after Dina died, Eren could still controll the mindless titan: thus the royal blood worked for a few more minutes (or hours since the other titans didn't follow them). The bright Armin should have remembered this detail and be cautious about Zeke's death because it would either lead to Colossals going rouge or nothing since Eren should still have the power.

Obviously we know from 122 that Eren obtained full power and Zeke is no longer necessary. I guess he dragged him along to kill him later and that the original plan was to kill all the other shifters as well and reunite the powers into one. Which would explain his distance towards Armin and their friends in the latest years and why Falco (a JAW titan) could be able to fly.

tonormicrophone1,Spaghestis,"Eva didnt get a movie because people were dissatisfied with the ending, it got a movie because Gainax had basically ran out of budget for the last two episodes of the show. The original final episodes were supposed to basically be a split up version of the movie, but they didnt have the money to animate all the flashy stuff, so they instead went for the more abstract metaphorical route that left some confused. Shortly after the show ended, the movie got greenlit, so they now got the money to animate the original vision, so episodes 24/25 basically became the movie. Honestly, I like that it ended up like this since I think the final anime episodes and the movie complement each other well. 

Attack on Titan on the other hand was not plagued by any external restrictions that caused its ending to be neutered. As far as we know the ending we got is more or less what Isayama wanted. Also the vast majority of the fanbase likes the ending- the people active on titanfolk are the only ones who openly dislike the ending, and its not like this sub is bustling anymore. Maybe there are others spread out, but overall maybe only around 10k people dont like the ending, thats maybe like 1-2% of the total english fanbase. Also it seems like the Japanese fans unanimously like the ending, and their opinion will matter more for Isayama than the english fans. And even if Isayama agreed with the ending haters, the issues with the ending are too numerous to be fixed in a single movie. Like a movie would cover a max of 6 chapters, meaning 133-139. In order to properly fix the ending, youd have to go back and start changing stuff from like chapter 105.

Me personally I was against it bc genocide is terrible but while the Alliance kept pushing the « other option » narrative, I really didn’t see it. I think that Zeke’s plan made the most sence to me but obviously wasn't a good nor acceptable option, Eren had his own solution so everyone would be free but the Alliance never proposed soemthing that seemed concrete and with long terms benefits. I also think it had to do with the worldbuilding but this is going to be long. In the end it seemed like a bad action which couldn't havd been stopped bc there were no other options, while I feel like the story wanted to portray Eren as a bad person, not only bc what he did was bad but also bc therr were other options.

If Eren had just become a head + spinal cord inside a crystal and made one of the Colossals carry him, the alliance would probably have had a harder time, and that's just one idea.


The whole final battle felt fake, with no stakes. It should have been impossible for the scouts to win, but they do so without a single death.


In Batman, the Dark Knight (2008), they do this properly.  Instead of a ""superhero save the world"" scenario, it's about two ships, one choosing to blow the other and the Joker. The stakes are smaller, the scale is smaller, but the tension feels real.


More important than the fact the scouts had no real plan is the problem the author created for himself when he made Eren's FT so godly powerful. If the author really intend for Armin and the scouts to find a way to defeat Eren, she should have made him defeatable.


I can accept the scouts going after Eren with no plan, willing to do anything they can to try to stop him, ready to die, since they were partially responsible for Eren getting the FT's power.


Killing wasn't a great plan, but since the Rymbling was already happening and they didn't have many other choices, there as a chance that doing so would stop the Rumbling. If it didn't work, it would just be a wreck on a wreck.

Isayama set up this conflict and stacked up all these reasons why the outside world *should* be rumbled, and then tried to turn and sell us this “Eren did it because he wanted to” bullshit, and *so many people* just *disagreed* with that canon reasoning.

It falls back on Yams’ nihilistic misanthropy; we can’t root for “the moralistic saviors of the world” because the world they’re idiotically defending is irredeemably awful. All the countries are like fuckin Warhammer factions, starting genocidal wars on whims, treating wars like they’re personal, and holding on to grudges for centuries. In Devilman, we feel bad for humanity because it’s a clear triumph of their hatred over their compassion, both of which were shown in great detail, but in AoT, humanity just never even has a “good side” that we would want to see preserved through the crisis.

Mfer justified global extinction and then tried to turn and criminalize the characters for seeing it *the way he made it*. Committing global mass murder *should* make a character unambiguously a villain, but he designed a trolley situation that makes people think “maybe not,” which seems to have muddied *his own* intentions with the framing of his story. It’s so stupid and weird.

Like, it he wanted Eren to do it *for himself* then we didn’t need all the reasons he listed. An Eren that disregards all reason for the rumbling beyond “I want to do it” wouldn’t become Hobo Eren or wait for the declaration of war, and the world wouldn’t need to unify in a genocidal war against Paradise, but for some reason, Isayama made all of those things happen anyway.",iirlppm,weyezw,titanfolk,2022-08-03 12:55:57,25,2,iir8xvf,theeshyguy,True

cpu9,Kustig,"Tbh as much as I want an AOE, the ending got just felt poorly written and ham-fisted together; which really leads me to believe you are correct.

But the one thing I don't see people bring up much in discussions is the fact that (assuming it were to happen) AOE would have to have been the original intended ending for the manga (otherwise it would have to be just another shoehorned ending like what we already got).  *If* it does turn out to a loop; Isayama would have to have intended that to happen within the manga.  Then when the anime succeeded would be when he considered changing the manga ending to further build up the original ending in the anime.

I really don't think Isayama was playing any 5-chess when the series started (he himself admitted that he rushed the beginning on account of not being confident in keeping the readers engaged).  But I also struggle to think that the same man who wrote RtS and the Paths arc would fail so much at the ending.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I don't think it's mutually exclusive that Isayama could be scared of writing Eren winning and him intending that to happen in an AOE.  Depending on how you see it, it could be his way of letting each reader choose the ending they prefer (and there by hope to avoid blame) or it could be the 'will to destroy' that he claims is reflected in the ending (and I like to think he didn't mean destroy his own legacy lmao).  And while the argument could be made that Kodansha wouldn't allow it; one could make the counter point that the manga ending first gives the pandering ending time make its sales, long before the anime flips a coin to either rejuvenate or demolish the series.

AOT is in a fixed timeline. Look up the ""Novikov self-consistency principle"" if you really want to. The past present and future have already happened so whatever actions Eren and Zeke do in the Paths will lead to the same state as they are in now.

2. How can you effectively explain to a 9 year old that his whole life is a lie and that he will have to commit atrocities in the future?

theeshyguy,TheOfficialGilgamesh,">spouts the nihilistic “philosophy” that humans just suck and there’s nothing your idiotic futile little slave self can do about it, and not even the universal concepts of karma or causality will stop the evil from flourishing.

Great post and this is what I agree with the most. This defeatist message of ""bro humanity is bad so never bother to change broooo"" is such a wannabe deep message. 

I also want to add how creatively bankrupt the ending in general is. In Breaking Bad for example, Walter was never excused by people around him at the end or was treated as an ""uwu tragic misunderstood little lamb"" like Eren was in the ending. He was hated by his family, had to come clear what his true motivations were and then died alone and broken in the only place he had ever found any true joy in. 

If you want to show that your main character does something irredeemable, then don't fucking shy away from calling him out. Better Call Saul for example in the recent episode, makes no attempt at trying to portray Jimmy as tragic and misunderstood for what he did in the episode. Is he sympathetic? Yes, absolutely. But he's still to blame for what he does.

I also see people call EM toxic because Eren headbutted her but my very honest first opinion on Mikasa was that she is a very rude bossy big sister who hurls him on the wall or floor whenever Eren does something she doesnt like and she doesnt keep the secrets he trusts her with so I actually disliked her. So I never understood the ""slave"" argument because my perception of her was quite the opposite.

Then her backstory was revealed and I understood exactly why she behaves this way, why she said ""that again"" when Carla died and the true nature of her relationship with Eren. After she blushed when Ian called Eren her boyfriend and Eren told her he is not her he is not her brother or kid, there was no reason for me to think of them as siblings.

GidgetSpinner,len_slibinas,"Hello, I really  liked your analysis. While I  wasn't initially onboard with Eren basically killing his own mother, it does make sense of some things.

I have read up through Chapter 138 and am up to date on the anime, so there might be  spoilers though my focus will be on an earlier section.  

With little time left I'm not sure if this will be resolved but it is still interesting to think about. First, despite my trying not to get too attached to anyone, Bertholdt became  my favorite  character, second  my favorite part is basically just before Utgard Castle up to Ymir, Bertholdt and Reiner recovering on the wall.   

Anyway, I always thought it strange how Bertholdt answers Eren's question when he asked him what Bertholdt was thinking when he told him how his mother died. Bertholdt gives him a long look and then replies,  ""At the time, I felt sorry for you."" (some translations  have  him say ""Back then""  or  ""In the moment"").  The specific way he phrases it  seems to imply that he  actually did feel bad for him at the time, but something changed since then and that is no longer the case.  Tied with the memory shard theory  it  could mean that Bertholdt has seen something, possibly that even Eren hasn't at that time and that is basically Eren took part in his mother's death.

While I'm not sure how Bertholdt would know this, it seems different titans have different abilities on the paths. I think possibly  the bearer of the Colossal is at times aware of  the guilt or sins in the past, present, and even future.  However the bearer is also burdened with the inability to do anything about them, and that the combination of the two weighs down on them. I thought maybe Bertholdt became aware of  what Eren did just before his transformation on the wall. In the anime version at least, he and Eren seem to have a moment where they are just staring into each other's eyes before it cuts to Reiner.  In the manga, it's a little different since it goes Bertholdt, Reiner, and then Eren.

I  don't think Eren really knew what Bertholdt was saying until he touched Dina's titan and then became aware of his own guilt in the matter and as he mourns Hannes he is also crying at what he has done.

I  also wonder if  maybe Armin had seen this in Bertholdt's memories.  He  seems to  be lying to  Eren when Eren asks him if he saw something in those memories and he says nothing significant.  Initially it just seemed that his crush on Annie has him basically spying on her in those moments,  but if he had seen either  Dina aka the smiling titan walking away from Bertholdt at the gate or he had seen what Bertholdt had  seen in Eren back then he might be  hesitant to share  this  information. 

Reiner also says that  of all the people to have the coordinate, that Eren is by far the worst. I don't know if that is a personal judgement  of character by him or if this is something the armored titan can figure out along the paths.  Fun note, the name Reiner means judgement warrior or deciding warrior,

MastodonDirect1720,sweetreverie,"It was actually a well-received ending in Japan— Mikasa’s popularity has always been off the charts there and EM is a definite favorite.

There are also several aspects of Japanese politics that Yams made the mistake of integrating into his story, and it definitely helped with shooting himself in the foot regarding the ending.

**EDIT:** it took a little digging but I finally found it— here’s a r/titanfolk comment from [a Japanese user’s perspective](https://np.reddit.com/r/titanfolk/comments/tbmrea/the_fact_that_the_anime_replaced_armin_with/i08ogkt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) (I’ll paste it here)

JockyCracker,curiousCat1009,"Yeagerist fan but also an Isayama defender here. My take is this. Eren is still selfish. He is not doing this to save Paradis. He neither cares about humanity or the people of Paradis. He says he is doing this for the people of Paradis and he wants to end the humans outside the walls.

It's strange because Eren doesn't act like Paradis saviour - he didn't stop the pure titans from running rampant. He probably used Floch and the Yeagerists for their nationalism. Some of Floch's ideals are too extreme to have been instilled by Eren. Or rather his interpretation of Eren's ideals is...

 But what he really wants is

1. Historia and her(more likely their) baby safe
2. His friends to live long lives

The rumbling is stopped. The alliance are regarded as heroes. Also the curse of Ymir is ended. Armin, Mikasa and the others will be Gods in the eyes of the world outside. Remember the Tyburs? Eldians and titan shifters yet the most powerful people in Marley. Regardless of the change in sentiment towards Eldians or the ""Devils"" of Paradis, his friends are safe. 

Now, Historia and her baby are also free. How? Paradis is certainly not free from the danger of getting wiped out in the future if the outside world decides to end them all. But Paradis would never hide behind Historia or her baby because of their royal blood. Their fates and Paradis future are no longer entwined. No one will try to sacrifice Historia or her child because there is no founder or titans. If the world does come for them, they will fight or run.

Historia fake banishes Mikasa, Armin and the others, so now they help the world rebuild. They start a new life. Armin would have no problem - he has Annie. Jean has Pieck?? Mikasa goes to Hizuru and reclaims her birthright. Levi opens a Monke themed teashop. Connie becomes Lord Cornelius Springer the First after marrying a hot Marleyan noblewoman and arranges for his mom to join him in Marley.

Everyone thinks Eren is dead but she visits Paradis as a visiting head of a friendly nation. She meets Eren under the same tree. Eren meets her there with his and Historia's child. End.",gn5sekq,liuucm,titanfolk,2021-02-13 09:15:53,16,1,,JockyCracker,False

Nedisan,LunarGhost00,"I saw quite a few anime-onlies suspect that Zeke was a traitor from only the fact that he hid his royal blood from Marley and then more people picked up on it when Eren had a baseball at the hospital. Even with some of the hints cut, people who pay attention to the story and can use their brains caught onto it. Some even think that Zeke manipulating Eren is BS and that Eren has his own agenda.

With the baby storyline, the anime cut 2 big clues (the hooded figure, whose identity would've been far too obvious in color, and Historia not marrying the farmer) and I've seen a ton of anime-onlies who already doubt that the farmer is the father and think it could be Eren. Once 130 is animated, the number of people who think that will grow exponentially. Cutting out the due date likely won't harm the mystery since I doubt anyone who is an anime-only would even remember that line by the time Historia gives birth in the anime (whenever that is) or realize that she's giving birth just a few days after Levi said that. Hell, not even a lot of manga readers realize that.

I think from just the part the anime already adapted and chapter 130, there will already be enough to foreshadow the twist if it happens and anyone who doesn't hate the ship with a passion for whatever reason should be able to see it as a possibility at least by the time 130 is adapted.

(During the beginning of the manga he had already planned Ymir Fritz). So most likely when they deleted that scene, it was simply to save time: During episode 1, they deleted the scene where Gabi tells Reiner to be careful; in episode 2 they erased Marley's map.

Like it isn’t in the manga and they created “foreshadow” for something that doesn’t exist. And it is not even like for the cool effect like the berserk titan, it is just there.

The only thing that is kinda cool in the anime version is seeing Eren saying he is gonna destroy the world, which is some cool foreshadow. But I would sacrifice this without second thought if I could make the anime be like the manga honestly. If this arc’s ending was equal and also the dream in episode 1 was equal to the manga, the aot anime would be even more solid. Throw in together not replacing some of Mikasa’s lines for extras “Eren!” and not changing her clan mark for some cloth (this isn’t a big deal but it kinda sucked they did this because many people thing her wrist mark comes out of nowhere in the fourth season) and there probably would be way less hate for Mikasa in the community also.

I was exhausted by the hate aot was getting after the ending I myself became a bit toxic fan. Everyone hyped season 4 way more when season 3 completed airing and everyone was exited how manga was gonna end and everyone was enjoying it. But now that manga has ended; the ending, season 4, aot everything became trash. I was annoyed because I couldn't express my excitement without getting a lot of hate by ending haters, sienen fandom and op fandom. That is why I started hating on other shows without even watching some of them. Now I feel so dumb because I was seeking validation from some random dude on internet. I can't even enjoy anime like I used to because of these dumb things. Time to leave some social media platforms because it really fucked me up for some silly reason and also time to stop interacting with toxic people.

If I love this story so much that I want to see it animated in a way that I love, seeing it animated in a way that I don't love is disappointing, and I want to express that. If I've seen this story and its animation at its best, I want to continue seeing it at its best.

Now this an exaggeration because while I didn't like the CGI, I still loved the episode and found that the CGI gets easier to look at the more you do it. 

It's impossible to expect an animation with a perfect budget because life is messy, and MAPPA is the only studio willing to pick up this series.

with the founder no one will be able to touch the Island it can control the rumbling and summon titans of the past so even aerial attacks will still be dealt with (flying titans ,war hammer titans)

and they have iceburst stone so with their partnership with hizuru they can upgrade their military power and let me remind you that they were the first to develop an airplane which other countries couldn’t 

so they had a plan they just wanted to look for alternative Solutions first but your Messiah was too busy playing pretending in a active war zone so he can have his dramatic reveal that easily could’ve been avoided if he stayed in paradise and shipped zeke on a hizuru ship to paradise that’s it, if he can meet with kiyomi in secret like he did in 107 he can do that too

2) very subjective, but how else do you think the battle could have gone? There are no additional powerups that I'm aware of that took place, eren is the founding titan so doesn't it make sense that he's invincible? This contradicts why he's losing atm but hopefully 139 will clear it up 

3) yes yams has gone out of his way to write eren off for alliance to develop, but 131 did show that eren is so broken he reverted to his childlike self to avoid feeling the guilt. And i think eren's current pov has been kept a mystery for a good reason and if that reason isn't gold enough from what we get in 139, yams deffo fucked up.

4) literally the opposite. The previous seasons relied on shit characters and incredible story and mysteries. Post timeskip aot relies on well written eren, reiner, zeke, grisha, gabi, falco, floch and hange. Some characters were sidelined and that's a valid criticism but to suggest that the previous seasons handled characters better is just wrong imo. Also this is the point that actually triggered me into writing this long ass response. 

5) final arc contains moments of tension and plot twists, why is this a criticism? Aot has relied on shock value since the beginning, like most works of fiction.

6) falco evolving like pokemon doesn't make too much sense. Agreed. Hange died trying to save the world and after sacrificing herself. Would you have rather hange died by an anonymous ancient shifter? Where would the sacrifice be if she was to die after reaching eren? Sacrifice is a common theme and it makes sense for the commander of sc to sacrifice herself. 

7) yes

mashijams,Gebeleizzis,"With Hange it really felt that she got killed only because Isayama did not know anymore what to do with her in the future. Before, every major character death led to something, had consequences (Sasha's death for example had major consequences) or their characters arc were at least completed. But Hange's death changed nothing, nor she died because she managed to complete her character arc. And her death was handed clumsy.",gr0zv66,m5nz3h,titanfolk,2021-03-15 17:28:11,12,1,,mashijams,False
mashijams,Mint_Choco7,"I agree with all your points. It’s interesting because I guess those criticisms are weighted differently? What you said is why I just can’t bring myself to like the arc. I’ll just comment on a few of your points:

2/5. Putting the physical fighting aside, the “this isn’t even my final form” is actually pretty on brand for Yams. Even the paths chapters, which are right regarded as one of the best stretches in the manga, suffers from this if you look close enough. Taking the plot twist that 121 provided away, those chapters were just Eren and Zeke pulling multiple uno reverses on each other.

4. Agreed. I like most if not all if my favorite characters less because of this arc. I’m still hoping that 139 can fix Eren but if not idk.

7. What makes this so infuriating is the lack of Eren, otherwise I wouldn’t mind.

8. I really hope this isn’t the case lol. Ymir acting so strange gives me some hope but idk how much we can expect from 45 pages. It would backpedal on all the claims fans have made about aot being so great because there’s no villain. The cycle of hatred conflict was amazing because there was no “big bad” you could just defeat to get rid of it but if that’s what’s happening now it would be a shame.",gr10sbt,m5nz3h,titanfolk,2021-03-15 17:34:54,5,1,,mashijams,False

Also from the 100-Cam we can clearly see them working on the scenes from 137 and 138

And weird how you say this but forget that they have set up:

1. Eren and Armin's Conservation set up in 131 in 139 (You claim the conservation would be different but i doubt that and it just seems like cope)
2. They have already teased Mikasa having the decision to kill Eren with the scene of Reiner seeing himself in Eren due to him wanting to be stopped because he could not handle the weight of genocide.
3. They already did Hange's sacrifice better than the manga, And you want all of that to be meaningless because you want Violence to be the only answer with Eren need Historia as his sex trophy or whatever with their child

All i am saying is that they are clearly setting up the chapters where Eren is stopped/killed that is all. The point he is saying is that the anime has already followed the source material closely.

If they make the way 139 was presented differently from the manga but still keeping the same elements of Armin saying goodbye to Eren, The titan powers disappearing, Levi's Final Salute(The best panel from 139), The rest of the group becoming Peace Ambassadors and Mikasa visiting Eren's grave then fine or Even the Extra Pages. Because Eren is not the only important character, As Armin and Mikasa all play important roles in the rumbling arc

\-Callback to Eren telling Mikasa to ""fight to win / live"" when she awakened her ackerman abillities in S1 EP6

\-Who influenced Eren to kill the slavetraders to save Mikasa in the first place

\-Reiner and Gabi also reuniting with their family and friends. It seems Zophia's family is there. They seem to be flying to the fort at the end of 135 cause they're so far away from Eren at that point.

\-Panels of Historia birthing 1-3 children. Personally I want to see her have triplets because she already parallels Ymir so much, even though Ymir had 3 children over time instead of at the same time. 2 will die, 1 will survive, just like wall Maria and Rose was breached (if you count Rose) and Sina / Sheena was not.

You mentioned Ackerman Origin so I'd put Royal Bloodline Origin too, because I speculate Maria started that one and Sina / Sheena started the Ackerman one.

\-Explanation for Mikasa's headaches

\-What Eren saw when he ate the warhammer. Tybur secrets? ancient history? a crucial piece of the puzzle?

\-The role of fate in the story and whether Ymir was bound by it too. It seems very likely. After all, Isayama just released a drawing of Ymir and pigs that has the words: ""A girl has a dream. She dreams of a world free from curses and fate.""

Something I would like to see:

A chapter called ""To you, 2000 years ago"" about Grisha knowing that Eren's way will happen and that it will be a disaster, so he uses royal blood to influence Kruger who then influences the previous attack titan shifter, which goes all the way back to the first one, either Ymir or Sina / Sheena I believe. And that's when she makes the Ackerman bloodline, for the sole reason and purpose to stop future Eren.

Kruger being Annie's grandfather. It checks out if Annie's mother had an early birth, and they look alike in some shots, but that's just a personal wish cause I think it would be cool to have at least one panel showing it. Maybe Kruger was bound by fate to save Annie just like Eren had to save Mikasa.

\-Annie using her Crystalization ability on Eren again. While Eren was in his flaming titan in S1 EP25, it was the only thing that made him scared. And he only barely escaped because Levi cut him out. So I wish she used it again and maybe that explains him looking petrified in the S4 OP.

An added little note to consider, if we want to keep the parallels between their map and the real world going, is that many of our largest cities around the world are next to an ocean and, if Eren's goal is to ""destroy the outside world"", it would make sense to target those cities the same way he targeted the fleet.

He did all of these things just because he was a slave to fate, or to the Attack Titan’s will, or just to ensure his friends would be the heroes in the end and live long lives. And yet he put them in so much danger: Sasha died because of his solo invasion, Hange died trying to stop him, and his friends experienced several traumatic near-death experiences just because of him. By his own admission, a whopping eighty (80!) percent of the world’s population was massacred by his own hands due to the rumbling. And we’re supposed to believe this was all an act? Who in their right mind would think that’s okay? Why would Eren believe that his friends would be satisfied that their lives came at the cost of so much? If it was all Eren’s 5D chess, why wouldn’t he try to discuss any of this with Hange and Armin, his very own tacticians that have saved him countless times, even when there seemed like no way out?

Shani_Jeizan,Soul_Stack,">we barely get any other reasons other than the fact that he saved her as a kid and that she now loves him.

That's so... You are missing so much. 

The guy not only saved her life, but motivated her to stand up and fight for herself. He gave her a motto to live by. Eren was the first thing/person who triggered an agency to do something within Mikasa. ""If you won't fight we can't live"". The girl lived away from the society in a really comfortable zone with her parents. She never faced such circumstances or was ever taught what to do in such a situation, she was merely 9 years old not to mention. 

After saving her, he even comforted with the scarf and gave a warm welcome in his family. The girl *just* lost literally everything wouldn't want to lose things again, would she, especially after losing her family a second time (Eren's parents). 

Carla, Eren's mom, even makes Mikasa make a promise to her, to always stand by Eren's side. 

>highlights a part of Eren and for Mikasa it always has to do with him saving her when they were 9

Everyone highlights the side of Eren with their experiences with him.

Mikasa's most 'important' experience with him was him saving her. She **always** highlights the kind, beautiful side of him. The way he saved her, his kindness, similar to how he saved Ramzi. 

Similarly when everyone started believing Eren has changed, Mikasa was the first person to highlight the fact that he hasn't. The flashback of him brutally killing those kidnappers says more than enough. Eren has always been like this. How he always runs far away from them. 

I don't even get these complains, honestly.....",maygk0s,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-04 18:41:50,6,3,may03wo,Shani_Jeizan,False
Shani_Jeizan,Soul_Stack,"You are making a post trying to 'criticize' a series, you can't do it based on 'vibes'. You can very much dislike the aspects of the characters and the story elements but your statements are rather bold and are accusing the characters of lacking things, which they aren't. Even an opinion should be easy to defend, but if you can't provide a counter point then you are more so supposed to accept the opposing opinion. 

What's 'bare minimum' for you isn't the bare minimum for a heavily traumatized girl who is so attached to that person. It's easy for *you* to acknowledge Eren's actions and straight up confront him, not for Mikasa, who the first time in her entire life was witnessing her driving force doing such horrible things.

Mikasa had always used Eren as a beacon to *fight* the cruelty of that world. She thinks it's all just misery, cruelty and suffering but then there was this one person who showed kindness to her at the lowest point of her life, which made her look up to him. You wouldn't be able to one day just stand up and confront your eternally loving parents on discovering something awful they did, and get them locked up, would you. It takes courage, the ability of acceptance and Mikasa's case is just ao much worse and worse. 

I highlighted in my other comment what that guy has done for her, and in such a case having to accept him as a whole for who he is, standing against him, accepting the idea of KILLING him and then actually becoming the one to kill him is no way easy for Mikasa. You can NOT compare the relationship of other characters and what Eren means to them with Mikasa's relationships and value of him. You are missing out Mikasa's POV and pretty much don't even see her character arc and the issues she has imo. ""I expected more"" isn't really a reply.",mb1khet,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-05 04:09:03,5,3,mazdbs0,Shani_Jeizan,False
Shani_Jeizan,Soul_Stack,"Mikasa's arc in Trost serves as a 'foundation' for her character, and highlights the major flaws she has as a person, and as a character in general. Mikasa was just 'louder' in Trost arc compared to the story further ahead. You need to take a more careful look at her character to really understand her progression throughout the story.

Despite being a pretty subdued character, she consistently has key moments in almost every single arc so I am not sure how much I agree with anything you said about her. 

Same for her development, it is very evenly spread throughout the story, she doesn't lack development that's pretty certain.

Saying she sacrificed 'nothing' is also a statement I can't make sense of. The will to kill the man and choose her ideals, her friends and the innocents over him, or just her duty over Family, is probably one of the most consistent character arc of hers. I shouldn't even need to go indepth about how much that guy means to her, and how hard the choice big of a choice it is. Mikasa spent her 4 years with him in peace during the time skip as well. Her time spent in the cabin doesn't take away anything imo.

One of the first things that Mikasa points out on meeting him is acknowledging the mass murder he was doing in Liberio. Mikasa straight up verbalises her motivations to join the Alliance ""I don't want Eren to kill anymore innocents, even if it for us"", as much as it has to do with Eren (which her driving force, like everyone else) it is very much about serving her duty. Mikasa doesn't 'verbally' challenges his ideology in the final battle, she 'acts' against it, literalized by her killing him and throwing away the cruel side of him. She didn't 'let' him die, she chose his death.

Take RTS as an example where she lets Armin die because Erwin was a better choice for humanity's survival. 

And tbh idk I don't agree to anything here, especially Mikasa, seems like you missed a good chunk or maybe didn't consider it.

Eren was my personal favorite so seeing this be done to him was…. truly an experience. It always frustrated me how this series beat down so hard on Eren for using violence to fix problems, yet we NEVER see an actual peaceful solution or peaceful handling be fully, successfully executed in this series. Armin should have done more, there should have been more effort put into showing him actually succeed using his words. But we never actually see this.

Shani_Jeizan,Warm-Bison2006,"Shame I discover this so late: Let me start by saying, if you felt that way no one can really say anything against that, but it feels like you set yourself up for failure by having wrong expectations that then clouded your judgement. Most people like you end up in the hell that is titanfolk or ANR, so I guess good you stayed on the good side lol.

Mikasa is the one most obvious to me since I spent a bit of time trying to understand the character. In my opinion it was never her ""job"" to confront Eren ideologically, that's what Armin did. Mikasa confronted him emotionally in that sense. I really don't understand what you mean by she sacrificed nothing, but the reason you may feel underwhelmed is because you misunderstood what happened to her? Because she did NOT let go of Eren, that was the point.

Armin and Eren I feel like are kinda fair\[?\] At least these are a little more subjective. I found some of your reaction to S4 very interesting, since it has so many memorable moments (maybe too much is happening? xd) => Declaration of War, Liberio Attack/Sasha Death, Table Scene, The entire episode trio pre-rumbling with Eren dying/Zeke and Eren in the paths and the Rumbling starting, The entire Rumbling?!...  
Unsure what to tell you.

Also out of curiosity why did you hate the Ymir ending?  
I feel like hating on Season 4 is a bit strange, since especially the first part is VERY strong, War for Paradis kinda loses itself at times in the action and the conclusion (the narrative coming together in the end) is slightly below average for AOT (probably like 9/10 for me with the rest 10/10 lol, but I guess I do get where you are coming from)",mbqwa76,1ihh5q3,AttackOnRetards,2025-02-09 00:35:57,2,1,,Shani_Jeizan,False

And she doesn’t ‘blindly’ follow Eren, she just chooses to be next to him.

Aot isn't pushing a pro-pacifism message. In fact, it promotes fighting when necessary and it explicitly criticizes inaction, pacifism, slave morality and self-hatred. The problem with Eren is that all he has is violence, it's the sole way he can derive meaning - through the existence of his enemies.

redeclipse619,sp1ke__,"> A major, central character to one of the biggest arcs in the story is written off by getting impregnated by a literal random guy who we don't even see the name or face of.

If that doesn't at least raise your eyebrow, you paid no attention to the story whatsoever. I feel like people just say that to be contrarian because the critique of that part is heavily associated with EH/titanfolk/AnR crowd and they do not want to admit they might be at least partially right.

I definitely agree that just because someone's character arc is ""completed"" doesn't mean they have to be written off. Sometimes an arc is not needed at all. Look at Gintoki in Gintama. His arc is completed. He's almost 30 years old after ton of experiences, a war veteran etc. and all we see is how his character reacts to various situations.  Not to mention i have to say that becoming a ruler is not the end of your arc, your work only just begins.

What pains me is that she is so lazily sidelined compared to everyone else. Yes, Season 4/post-timeskip has a lot of issues, especially with dumbing down of characters and worldbuilding, but she is the most extreme case i think. She has been there from the start. She was part of the original squad from the start, why Connie and Jean deserve to be central in the endgame but she doesn't? She also fought titans alongside them and was their friend so to treat her like that narratively is very concerning.

One thing that people might not notice is that she doesn't have a SINGLE scene in post-timeskip that is not some sort of flashback aside from just a few 2-3 second shots of her standing or sitting in a chair or something. We literally never see her react to current events. Even in the endgame we just read her letter and that's about it.",l4l9oe3,1crxnqs,AttackOnRetards,2024-05-18 14:13:23,2,1,,redeclipse619,False

RusselAxel,lucv2004,"You missed my point entirely. I was saying I’ve read many other manga and anime and in most of them the romance is very clear cut. Take for example Ed and Winry’s relationship in FMA:B, a *Japanese shonen manga* made for the same audience as AoT. It’s a romance where both sides’ feelings are clear and mutual. Hell, the other romances in AoT itself are very, very obvious. Ymir and Historia clearly loved each other. Same with Falco and Gabi, and funnily enough it was conveyed in the least subtle way possible. In EM’s case, Eren’s feelings for her are very confusing up until chapter 139. 


Also, aren’t multiple, diverse points of view important in objective criticism? Why should only Japanese people be allowed to criticise a manga? Extrapolating from your logic, you shouldn’t consume any media unless you’re the exact target audience for it.",h32e6yi,o7q2zd,AttackOnRetards,2021-06-26 04:28:27,6,3,h30vvwx,RusselAxel,False

Berserk's romance between Guts and Casca is subtle, but I still notice mutual affection and care between them. There are no extravagant displays of their love, but all their romantic moments come off as completely genuine. With EM, I see none of that. All their moments are just Mikasa loving him and Eren giving her none back (sans two scenes, one in 50 and one in 123).

Dependent_Lab8918,GLNK1,"131 and 139 is just way too much content for one episode. Dawn of Humanity adapted about 30 pages of chapter 130, and about 25 pages of 123. On top of that, the second half of 130 has tons of large panels, some double page spreads and not all that much dialogue. Even then, it only just fit inside 1 episode. Chapter 139 is 45 pages on its own, and that's not including the extra pages they may well include at the end of the episode. 131 up until it cuts to the boat is about 30 pages as well. There's just no way you could also fit 131 in there, even if you're only going to show the Eren section at the beginning.

Even without that, I don't think it's a great idea. The brutality of 131 is crucial in helping people empathise with and support the alliance, it's hard to fully grasp how awful the rumbling is without that. 134 does a good job as well, but I think you need the more personal moment with Ramzi. On top of that, coming off 138 we'd already know that Eren is dead and has lost, so I don't see how the stakes would be there for the first half of 131.

AdImpossible6194,Warm_starlight,"Her decision was implicitly influenced by Eren though. Before being pulled in the paths she was struggling with the idea of killing him. Immediately after she comes out of it she is determined to kill him but it isn't grief or conflict we see on her face, but a smile before she lops off his head. She also knew all of Ymir's situation. This suggests that Eren talked to her about it in the paths just like he did with Armin. She already knew her role in all of this and saving both Ymir and everyone else. He explained everything to everyone when he met them as we see their reactions (Jean, Annie, Reiner, Connie and such) so it would be weird to assume only Mikasa was left in the dark. 

I think it's only presented as an independent choice, but it wasn't. I would have prefered if she made the choice without having any knowledge and without being pulled in the paths prior to that. Only then could she be pulled in the paths before Eren's life completely ran out and explained everything so she doesn't live blaming herself and wondering.",j9e4arc,117lu90,AttackOnRetards,2023-02-21 07:35:58,4,1,,AdImpossible6194,False

No problem! :)

**Answer to note 1.**

I agree that Armin's conversation with the Jaeger bros were too undervelopped, it was just too easy for Armin to suddenly convince Zeke, someone whose philosophy revolves in regretting the fact they were born, that life matters.

Same thing could be said for Armin's conversation with Eren although I found this one in particular worse than Armin and Zeke's conversation.

For me another reason why I disliked the ending was the sentence ""I don't know... I just wanted to... at all cost."", which was Eren's answer as to why he started the Rumbling.

The answer neither proved that he was selfless answer: ""I wanted to protect Paradis/protect you guys and have live long live"" nor that he was selfish ""I wanted to start the Rumbling because I was disappointed with the fact humans lived outside the walls and so I wanted to wipe them all out just like it was described in your (Armin's) book"". And it wasn't some combination of the two, it was a simple yet blank unsatisfying answer: ""I don't know, I just wanted to at any cost.""

Well it's logical they'd be mad over the presence of that panel, it's easy to remove ONE page than it is to remove a LOT of pages to fix the pacing of the ending, and I agree with this take.

**Answer to note 7.**

Well if a girl tore her skirt in front of you, so she could bandage you, I find Reiner's reaction reasonable as Historia was the type of person people would fall over her, in season 1, both Jean and Armin call her an angel/godess. Especially considering that Reiner was 17 at the time.

However chapter 139's Reiner is different, not only was his scene another level of pervertedness, (it's like smelling a woman's underwear, although less creepy because it's a letter) but it's really unsettling and creepy, especially since Historia is married and because Reiner is an adult now, I believe he is 25 post Rumbling time skip.

My point is that both past and present Reiner's behaviour are on different levels of pervertedness and creepiness, with one fitting for a certain age range/version of Reiner and the other just isn't, soldifying what I said about misplaced humour, if anything ir was cringey and unsettling.",hw344pp,smrxo7,AttackOnRetards,2022-02-08 15:40:12,1,3,hw2zm8b,The_One_Nerd,False
The_One_Nerd,Far_Celebration_8827,"As an ending hater, I'm going to give my own reasons for disliking the ending, beware I'll be somewhat bias.

**Answer to note 1.**

Anytime Eren cried in the series, I personally never found it annoying, he was always true to his character/ideals and the reason why he cried were realistic.

He cried at his mom's and Haness's deaths, when he found out Bert and Reiner were the Armored and Colossal, when he found out his father killed the Reiss family and stole a power that wasn't his which made him realise he wasn't special, and my favourite of them all is when he cried to a random kid because his morals conflicted with his ideals, which made a complexe yet almost human character.

As someone who reads manhwas and romance webtoons from time to time, I can assure you that Eremika was the shallowest canon ship I've ever seen. Now I'm not a shipper, I don't care if Eremika or Erehisu make it to the finale, I started watching AOT for its amazing plot and world building, and not for its romance aspect as I only saw it as sub plots for why characters acted a certain way, like with Nicoolo and Shadis.

But Eremika never had any build ups, all it had are hints that Mikasa was an important figure to Eren, we see Eren blusing due to the sunset as he looks at Mikasa, ask her once ""What am I to you?"", there is the whole ""I'll wrap that scarf around you forever, as much as you want"" and the fact Mikasa's crystal shards are the biggest. But this doesn't contribute to the buildup of the ship, as I still see Eremika too one sided to consider it a proper relationship.

So when Eren broke down crying for Mikasa, not only did that feel as if it came out of nowhere but it also doesn't Eren broke down crying, if he was going to cry I'd expect him crying over the people he killed, about all the regrets he has, and the sins he had to burden, how he saved Ramzi once only to kill later. That's the Eren breakdown I want to see, not the one we got in the manga.

**Answer to notes 2 and 3 and 10.**

I also had no problem with the Alliance winning, I kinda expected it, I just didn't know how Isayama would deliver some sort of epic twist to turn the tides to the Alliance's side. That one guy vowed that Eldians won't be mistreated or viewed as devils, which tied into the idea that if a large threat was to appear, humanity will join together to fight it, which worked by the end.

My problem here is that instead of a twist that would help the Alliance, we got a Code Geass ending which I'm not a fan of.

It's true Paradis got bombed later, but judging by the size of the tree, the buildings, the aircraft, I'd say that this is set far into the future, so while the cycle of hatred will never stop, Eren's friends got to live happy lives.

Even if Eren were to 100% rumble all of earth, some day, Paradis will spread to the, what was once nations that were flattened, and once said lands gets conquered, new nations will form and will split into wars with each others, in other words we'd always be in war. (Basically what happens in real life, a big nation can get split multiple smaller nations that aren't on good terms)

**Answer to notes 4 and 5.**

Only Ymir knows.

It's at this point, I started to dislike the later chapters way before 139 was released, as I realised how flawed this arc is and how rushed it was by the end.

**Answer to note 6.**

Mikasa couldn't seperate from Eren and thus picked her scarf once more because of her resolve and love for Eren.

Ymir **loved** King Fritz, and couldn't let go of her love until seeing Mikasa who loved Eren, cut him down, thus almowing Ymir to move on.

I personally hate this twist of her loving Fritz, because you see, wanting to be loved by your abused is not the same as loving your abuser, and even watching the latest episode I can see that the ""Ymir wanting to be loved"" holds true, while ""Ymir loving King Fritz"" just doesn't.

**Answer to note 7.**

I don't see it as it destroying his character, but it did make him creepy and perverted, because the Reiner I knew didn't act this way back when he was 14 to 17 and was a cadet/scout.

Sometimes Isayama's comic relief just doesn't work, it falls flat, just look at Annie's pie scene, it wasn't the proper time or space to play jokes, and it didn't make sense for Connie to act like that at that point. Yes this is Connie, the one who makes jokes while RTS arc is happening, and even then I didn't laugh as I was confused and the joke went over my head, but season 4's Connie is different, just look at his breakdown in front of Onyankopon, he was mad, felt betrayed and tired.

**Answer to notes 8 and 9.**

I agree with this point.

Also I found Annie's special power to be useless? No that's not the right word. Probably... Underwelming in a way? Eren can also drink serums and get hardening powers and his powers have nothing to do with gaining extra special powers by drinking super bottles, unlike Annie's.

So what's so special about the Female Titan then?

**Answer to note 11.**

I think it's due to what we've seen from chapter 121, it somewhat showed that Eren will stop at nothing to obtain freedom even if that meant manipulating your own father to kill an entire family just to obtain a power that would grant you freedom.

Oh as for ""the most logical conclusion would've been Eren making the shifters unable to transform"", I'd like to say that Eren could've memory wiped the shifters, Hange and Gabi to make them stay in the island and npt attempt fighting him. Espcially due to him being aware of his friends's conversation when he had the Founding Titan.

**Answer to note 12.**

Halluchan's death doesn't bother me much, I just headcanon it as Eren's death made the parasite die on its own.

**Answer to note 13.**

I believe it's due to both the future memories and the soeech by 10 years old Eren. At least that's my headcanon.

**Answer to note 14.**

From my understanding, yes.",hvydx2m,smrxo7,AttackOnRetards,2022-02-07 16:33:35,6,1,,The_One_Nerd,False

Imo, 80% was never planned. He just knew the future and the time when he would be stopped. If you know the future and wants to follow it, everything is looked like a plan. Meantime, he felt enormous guilty and had no will to fight any more, like Reiner. It happened that he was stopped at 80%. If the alliance was slower he would be stopped at 90%, 95%, 99%.

> 3)I was appalled by the fact that Paradise was bombed and destroyed and thus all our people ultimately getting killed 

It depends on who are ""our people"" for you? Most of the Alliance members don't even live on the Paradise any more. In the end of 139 they were going back from other countries to the Paradise to the Eren's grave. In my headcanon Arimin-Annie children survived.

And, yes, it happened at least 80-90 years after the Rumbling. We don't know anything about the next conflict. 


> 4) If Eren had obtained the founder, why did he still need Zeke for the rumbling? 

Ymir needed him for some reason. She obtained free will after Eren's speech, but by the same free will she still wanted to be connected with royal blood and probably wanted to hear Armin-Zeke conversation. 


> 5) Wasn't Zeke trapped in the paths? Suddenly he got out to be killed?

He just didn't even try to escape until Armin encouraged him.


> 6) parallel with Ymir

When I referred to Uri having a selfish obsession, I really mean King Fritz. But since the only Uri we really get to know is the one who was already under the control of his weird mind fuckery, he shares his ideology. 

Essentially King Fritz (the one from 100 or so years ago) is a massive hypocrite. He claims that he wants to have his people live in peace and create a paradise for them, but in reality he just created the illusion of a paradise for himself. Sure, things in Stohess sure looked nice. He was surrounded by prosperous and happy people. But as soon as we start looking outside of Stohess, it becomes clear that this ""paradise"" He supposedly created is a bunch of bullshit. Just look at what happened to Erwin's dad, Armin's parents, most of the Ackerman clan, all before Reiner and Bertholdt ever rocked up to the walls. The Military Police literally exist to make anyone who questions the truth disappear. And again, Ackerman clan, hunted to near extinction, need I say more? Oh yeah, and when an epidemic sweeps Shiganshina District, something that we know he could stop, nothing is done.

Sonik_Phan,Paclone,"Depends on the person.

For example, I already quite disliked the rumbling arc because of the constant ass pulls, lack of stakes, off-putting humor and overall not matching the tone of the series, even before 139. It had great moments(131, 134), but a lot of the Alliance moments were really badly executed.

When i read 139, i felt nothing really. I even thought I liked it at first, but honestly, I just was ready to accept any ending at the time. I just wanted the series to stick the landing. I wanted the series to be over and was ready to accept whatever ending we ended up with.

However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that despite the Rumbling arc being messy, 139 was another level. It retconned every single important event of the series and it lead to nothing. If Eren had the power to control Dina, he had the power to control all Pure Titans. Hence, he was responsable for all the deaths in the series. If this lead to something, like the end of the cycle of hatred *against Eldians*, i would understand, but it was all for nothing. 

Besides, every single character turned into a shell of themselves. It was all about love, when it never was. Honestly, if you think about it, almost every character was ruined in the ending. Historia chose a farmer who threw rocks, Eren decided he didnt have any motivation, Armin decided to care more about Mikasa feelings than the rumbling and the lives that were lost. Ymir decided to love an abuser, and Reiner last moment was to be a sniffe. Jean decided to marry a girl who never cared about him, and honestly thats quite a shame.",k8xss0b,17tc6k9,AttackOnRetards,2023-11-12 16:46:21,-2,2,k8vynih,Sonik_Phan,False

Yes war continued as is in that timeline, but it also in the rumbling timeline. Eren throughout S4 and the final seasons exhibits is convincing himself the rumbling is for the greater good, it’s not Eren wanted a sandbox of a world to play in and took it personally when that wasn’t the case and blamed the world because it made him so it deserves him.

Reasonable_Carob2534,YardOk5005,"I always saw Eren’s change as him trying ‘something new’ since it follows a theory I love that Eren’s future self is constantly manipulating his past self via how the Attack Titan inheritors can receive memories from the future as well as the past. 

This is linked to the first chapter in the manga and the anime (I think it’s been a long while) where Eren talks to Mikasa about the future, like her hair being short. 

So theory goes that Eren is trying to find a ‘perfect’ timeline where everything goes according to plan and the people he loves gets a happy ending. Ofc, it’s not perfect perfect, since Sasha dies and he was expecting it but I’d say 8/10 is better than 0/10.

I saw the part where Mikasa and Eren run away as a previous timeline where Eren did what he wanted and I see the current timeline where he starts the rumbling as him sacrificing himself for his friends even though he wants to live with them.

So he does things like guiding the smiling titan to eat his mother in order to keep Berthold alive, and in the same way he forced his own father to kill the royal family in order to steal the Progenitor Titan; he’s been manipulating the past to get a ‘good ending’ for his friends. 

One where War ends. 

This can also be seen when Eren’s dad meets the Owl and the Owl says,

“If you want to save them all… Mikasa, Armin and the others… Carry out your mission until the end.”

I always saw this as Eren’s desires leaking even the past users because he wishes to keep all of them safe. 

I’d even go as far as to say, Eren was the reason Grisha lead his sister to go outside therefore ensuring he met Diana, Zeke was born and Eren afterwards.

He’s definitely capable of it since he got the smiling titan to eat his own mother, therefore ensuring Armin became the future Colossal Titan and that his younger self would hate titans: creating the plot we read/watched in order to take revenge. 

As well as forcing his dad to massacre a family. 

So yeah, at least in my head canon, the moment after ‘The End’ Eren wakes up underneath that tree on a hill, confused about his dream and ready to repeat the story; albeit with a few changes in order to get that happy ending he’s been looking for.

Saying that, I’m definitely a little biased since I really like time stuff like regression (when done right)

Anyways, I saw the post and got reminded of all this so thanks for the blast from the past.

Also it does suck Fr that we barely see Eren in the latter half, granted it makes sense from a narrative standpoint since there’s supposed to be that whole ‘he becomes a villain’ thing while his friends try to stop him but as you said it would’ve been nicer to see what Eren was thinking before he straight up told us. 

Felt like his main character status got switched to antagonist for plot reasons.

nimbvcx_,m0rgz,"Well first I'll get the negative stuff out of the way. The whole episode was fast-paced and because of this, I feel like the more emotional scenes didn't get a lot to air out(or resonate? Idk but it hurt alot of the episode). I noticed it most when Eren was talking to ramzi, like Ramzi death was really good but eren's confusion was just ok to me. Another example is when hange and Levi were talking about the dead survey corps members and later on when levi to give your heart( [I also think levi looked a little sadder in the manga](https://images.app.goo.gl/WEEYBebV1hXinQPMA) . One last thing when hange was appointing Armin commander, the ost should have switched to bauklotze instead of staying on footsteps of doom.

I expected muller to sound more regretful when gave his speech and I didn't think the ost( the global allied fleet)  fitted the scenes. I believe this concludes my nitpicks and critics.

Now on to the good shit.Ramzi's death and the rumbling was horrifically beautiful(if that makes any sense) I liked how got to the fate of Eren's grandparents, the pure desperation of the people trying to escape the rumbling, and the brutality of it all was executed very well. The build-up to Eren's freedom scene was great but found the actual ironic panel itself was ok. The new soundtrack for the rumbling and eren freedom panel was also good.

Now for 132's adaption. Floch's death was good but hange's was something else, the animation was so fucking kino l  didn't expect it to be that good, and great ost choice too. 

The moment the alliance jumped out of the was so hype and it's animation was 🔥. [THE SOUND DIRECTOR FINALLY USED THE VOCALS PARTS OF SPLINTER WOLF YOOOOOOO ](https://youtu.be/sAXZbfLzJUg) . 

I also noticed composition, background, and sky lighting is a step up from the previous parts. And cinematic shots too

Kromostone123,Megashark101,"Season 3 Episode 10 adapts Chapter 69 of the Manga, which is Isayama's favourite chapter. And you can really see why. While the Uprising Arc was heavily cut down in the anime, much to my (and other people's) displeasure, this episode lost hardly any of the original brilliance that it had in the manga.

Everyone's characters and motivations that are revealed in this episode just make sense with how they have been characterised. Like, you can tell why Kenny admires Uri and wants to be like him. You can understand why Uri spares Kenny's life and takes him under his wing. You get why the world of AOT is the way it is, because it is routed in the very human actions of these well defined and consistent characters.

And obviously, Kenny's final monologue contains probably some of the most important dialogue in the series. Usually I dislike it when villains get a ""sympathetic backstory"" dumped on us right before a villain dies, but here it makes sense because Kenny is reflecting after the events of previous episodes finally made him arrive at the truth. Obsession is one of the core themes of AOT, and Kenny all but confirms this in his dialogue. And it's subtle and earned enough that him essentially summing up the series doesn't feel cringeworthy or on-the-nose. After all, even at the end of the series, 70 chapters after this episode ends, people still don't get that. Characters like Eren, Uri, Reiner and Zeke will all try to justify their actions with noble motivations, but it all comes down to a deep rooted, selfish obsession.

Season 3 Episode 11 is the thematically imperative masterpiece that tricked everyone into just thinking it was some unimportant backstory for a cool side character.

Tl;Dr: Excellent characterisation of Uri and Kenny, and a beautifully subtle contemplation on one of the most overlooked themes of the story.",hjp8obv,qomped,AttackOnRetards,2021-11-07 19:02:17,10,1,,Kromostone123,False
